8,Squid Game,"Action & Adventure, Mystery, Drama",7.9,"extremely disappointing idea theft
So once there was ""The most dangerous game"" (you see ""game"" in the title?) where shipwreckes survivors are hunted by Count Zaroff and if they survive they're free. Then on the ""survive or win"" we have Cube, Saw, Death race, Hunger games, Battle royale (already the most ripped off in Squid Game, As the gods will (also extremely ripped off in Squid Game).
So here the theme is the bleak today's world where a father can't keep a job and gain money for his family. So an invite comes for a game where you can gain big money. But soon contestants die. My interest died at this point. But to have an opinion, I watched it til the end. There was a big reveal, wow that was the best they could do? 
So to be precise in the ripoffs. Battle Royale, teenagers are sent to an island and the sole survivor is freed. This is a GAME, there's rules, a duration, an objective. Same for SG, rules, objective, duration. As the gods will we have teenagers visited by a strange head sculpture that takes them hostage and makes them participate in various KIDS games where most will die. Does it describe Squid Game? Especially the ""kids"" games turned to horror adult death traps.
The directing and acting are average at best. I got fed upo with the father fast with his stunned face he does all the time.
Some design of the games is OK, but also close to As the gods will.
I put 1/10 for obvious steal of an already oversused idea (yeah Hunger Games was of the most horrible movies I've sen in my life).","Lee Jung-jae, Lee Byung-hun, Yim Si-wan, Wi Ha-jun, Kang Ha-neul","extremely disappoint idea theft `` dangerous game '' ( see `` game '' title ? ) shipwreck survivors hunt count zaroff survive 're free . `` survive win '' cube , saw , death race , hunger game , battle royale ( already rip squid game , gods ( also extremely rip squid game ) . theme bleak today 's world father ca n't keep job gain money family . invite come game gain big money . soon contestants die . interest die point . opinion , watch til end . big reveal , wow best could ? precise ripoffs . battle royale , teenagers send island sole survivor free . game , 's rule , duration , objective . sg , rule , objective , duration . gods teenagers visit strange head sculpture take hostage make participate various kid game die . describe squid game ? especially `` kid '' game turn horror adult death trap . direct act average best . get feed upo father fast stun face time . design game ok , also close gods . put 1/10 obvious steal already oversused idea ( yeah hunger game horrible movies 've sen life ) .",-1,-1
8,Squid Game,"Action & Adventure, Mystery, Drama",7.9,"Whilst not an entirely original idea, ""Squid Game"" is done with enough inspiration, to warrant at least, a look. 

That said, it took me quite some time to tune in. The idea didn't immediately appeal to me, as it did a lot of other viewers. I found the first season, creative, colourful and more than little disturbing. Of course, children's games combined with murder, was never going to be comfortable mix. 

I do believe season one is markedly better than the second go around. Season two offers more of the same, with less of the intrigue inherent in the first season. The introduction of blatant DEI content in season two, is something I could have well and truly done without, too.

In summary, I believe ""Squid Game"" is a one season hit. Having watched all of season one and most of season two, I see little to distinguish two from its predecessor.Give season one a go by all means but my personal belief is season two, adds little of value.

8,Squid Game,"Action & Adventure, Mystery, Drama",7.9,"Masterpiece in every way! It's super interesting. Not a single dull moment in this show. 

However, in season 2, seems like liberal fascists infiltrated in this show and meddled with this it. So, we got transgender character who identifies himself as a ""woman""and goes to women restroom with the rest ladies. Others also refer to him as ""her"". I'm so tired from this crap. Man is man and woman is woman, period. No matter how many times you liberal fascists try to put your idiotism and dirty agenda into movies and shows, this fact will remain fact and you only enrage people more with your forced propaganda. This is why you lost in US elections and this is why you're going to lose more and more. Get used to it. You're a dying breed, leftists.

I'll still give this show 10/10, because show itself is a real masterpiece. Probabaly creators were forced to put this crap agenda in season 2, because season 1 was clean from it. Hopefully after January 20th, when Trump enters the office, we will see less and less propaganda in shows and movies.

18,Coronation Street,Soap,5.3,"If I were rating the Coronation Street classic shows from the 60s to the early 90s, I would give it 10 stars. For the last 30 years, however, it would garner more like 5 or 6 stars. This drama started out being fairly realistic, with humor and drama in equal measure, and a cast you pretty much like from top to bottom, and which tried to represent the people of northern England, (Manchester and thereabouts). There were low expectations for the show, but it took off and made rock stars ut of the performers. 

Now Coronation Street has become more like U.S. soap operas. Some people say it is the influence of the newer soap operas like East Enders, with its screamfests. So now there is less humor, fewer long-term characters, and murder, murder, murder.

So if you try the current iteration of Coronation Street and find you don't like it plots or pacing, track down some of the older shows and give them a whirl. You just might get hooked on them.",William Roache,"rat coronation street classic show 60s early 90s , would give 10 star . last 30 years , however , would garner like 5 6 star . drama start fairly realistic , humor drama equal measure , cast pretty much like top bottom , try represent people northern england , ( manchester thereabouts ) . low expectations show , take make rock star ut performers . coronation street become like u.s. soap operas . people say influence newer soap operas like east enders , screamfests . less humor , fewer long-term character , murder , murder , murder . try current iteration coronation street find n't like plot pace , track older show give whirl . might get hook .",-1,0
40,American Idol,Reality,5.078,"American idol, a season and series juggernaut, one of the most incredible and unique competitions to ever spark the world with the possibility of an unknown person becoming a mega star.

Randy, Paula and Simon, iconic names on their own, but even more when you combine them together. Randy Jackson was a music mogul, an individual who played for Mariah Carey, and a legend in his own right. Paula Abdul music icon from the 80s, one of the biggest selling artist and amazing choreographers ever to step foot on a stage. And then Simon Cowell, the ruthless, aggressive and honest individual that America fell in love with. And has went on to become one of the Biggest Music executive directors in the world.

I’m going to captivate all seasons in this one review, so this is going to be a long one, so enjoy. 

Season one, what an incredible journey, a show that you did not think was going to last let alone become such a mega hit that it became. But more importantly, you had to have the right winner. With America voting did we get the right winner? America selected the quiet yet powerful vocals of Kelly Clarkson. Kelly Clarkson went on to solidify the show as a mega superpower. When she became a Grammy award-winning artist, television actress, movie actress, and she is now has a syndicated talk show. Kelly Clarkson went on to sell millions of albums, worldwide and even placed, second place in Idol against all the other idol competitions around the world.

Season two was the biggest controversial season we saw to date trying to follow up with the success of the first season, we awarded Ruben Studdard, the winner of American idol with a bunch of controversy, whether or not Clay Aiken should’ve been the one to go onto the show. Either way, both men came out of the successful and not only did the two men come out successful. Kimberly called well became in Household, hosting and becoming an actress.

Season three delivered Fantasia Barrino, one of the most underrated incredible voices in the world. Her voice is so unique and iconic. She went onto also become a Grammy award winner and best selling R&B artist. She also stemmed Jennifer Hudson and Oscar winning and Grammy winning artist as well from that season who plays seventh place. This showed American idol was not just focused on the winner, but the people from the top 12 also had an opportunity to become super successful. From the season alone we also got Deanna Degarmo who went to become a Broadway legend.. 

Season four, we got the greatest and legendary country singer in Carrie Underwood. She brought the fire and tore that season apart. She was a young lady who did not know anything and never had been on a plane. To go on and become a multi time, Grammy award winning artist and mega power, and now she sits at the table as one of the judges for American idol. 

Season five became the new controversy, after season two and season three brought us severe controversy season five hit us even harder. Taylor Hicks took home the title of American Idol during this season, and ended up failing as a credible winner. Not being able to hold up to the four before him. All four artists before him either are Grammy winners or Grammy nominated artist. Taylor could not live up to those expectations and standards. His fourth finisher Chris Daughtry went to be a Grammy award-winning rockstar. Which is the person everyone thought was going to win this show. Catherine McVie became an actress and Elliott Yamin pulled out a great singing career as well. we also got the Grammy award winning Christian artist Mandisa, and we got country artist of Bucky Covington and country superstar Kellie Pickler. Season five may have had the wrong winner, but it had the most incredible group of top 12. 

Season six, we got NFL football players, daughter Jordon Sparks as the winner youngest winner at that time. She went on to become also a Grammy nominated artist, keeping the trend alive that success can come from the show. We also got the boxing talents of Blake Lewis, and a few other individuals who stemmed from the show, but didn’t make it to the superstardom level.

Season seven we started to the show out with one of the most incredible finale battles. We’ve seen in a long time David versus David , two different individuals. One rocker and one gospel singer. The older David, David Cook came out on top as he prevailed the rocker of the season. He went on to sell multiple albums, but still never reached the stardom of five of his predecessors. He still had a very successful career, but it was never a megastar career.

During our season, eight journey, American idol decided to spice things up by adding a fourth judge. Kara Diaguardi and she brought a lot of controversy between Simon and herself. After seven years of being the three they are now the four. Kris Allen captured the title of season eight, with one of the most controversial wins of all time. Front runner and expected winner. Adam Lambert went on to become a star in his own right, but was believed to be the actual winner of the show. But America was not ready for an LGBT winner. Especially someone who was completely open about their sexuality. Now American Idol served a little differently than it normally did you may have got a few people to have minor success after the show. But by this time, if you weren’t the winner, you barely got any success afterwards and that didn’t even mean if you got success. Unfortunately, he may have won the competition but he did just as bad as the previous winner from season five.

We move onto season nine still with the same set of judges, Lee Dewyze wins the title in the most forgettable, unsuccessful, and unpopular season ever. America was not fond of the singer, songwriter, crooner season, that transpired from dispatch. The only thing we got from this was gospel singer Colton Dixon, which to be honest with you, he might’ve actually came from a different season, they also attempted to spice things up just a little more, by replacing longtime judge Paula Abdul with Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen did not work out, she hated everything about judging people, and quit the show immediately after.

Season 10, we return to a three judges panel. With Ellen DeGeneres quitting and American idol not renewing Kara‘s contract, and then Simon Cowell exiting the show. We were left up in the air with the judges panel. They brought on Steven Tyler from Aerosmith and Latin legend, Jennifer Lopez. This season saw the winner of Scotty McCreery, who went on to become a country superstar, but not only that he also was the first in a long time where the runner-up went on to be a country superstar in Lauren Alaina. America and American idol were back on top.

We moved into season 11 with the same judges Randy, Jennifer,Steven and what a group they turned out to be, funny and hilarious and great judges. We saw the coronation of Philip Phillips, who went on to have one of the greatest singles of all time. And even had it as the Olympics theme song for that year. Philip had struggled afterwards to captivate and connect with the audience. Which put him in the same boat as Taylor, David, Kris and Lee. But the American Idol team was helpful.

We moved on to season 12 this season saw the departure of Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez as judges. And brought in Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey. Unfortunately, for this season, Nikki and Mariah could not get along. The fighting, the continued arguments and bantering back-and-forth, took away from the contestants, and took away from their singing, and what the competition in the show was all about, and it turned into a dramatic all out mess. This season we got the winner of Candice Glover, who went on to do nothing, she became one of those forgotten winners, and one of the most failed American Idol winner of all time at this moment. She did release an album, but it failed on the charts. And it was because I believe the focus was off of these individuals and more on the dramatics of the judges. So nobody grew to love them like you did the previous winners.

So we went on to season 14 of American Idol. At this time, American Idol did not invite Nick or Mariah back, and Randy Jackson decided to part ways. The company brought back Jennifer Lopez to join Keith Urban and then brought on Harry Connick Junior, these three became the saving Grace of at least the judges panel. But it was too late for the show. The show kept these judges for the next three seasons. This season we saw the winner Caleb Johnson who took Candice‘s spot as the worst American Idol winner of all time. His failed rocker vibe and music did not captivate or grab anyone’s attention. His album flocked American idol continue to go.

Season 14, we got the winner of NickFradiani personally he is one of my favorite winners, because his music is incredible and underrated. But to the general public, he didn’t sell as bad as the other two but he’s definitely in the bottom five. He did continue to go on to perform in local venues and push forward the best he could. But now it was a stain on the American idol winners, and I believe it stems from that toxic judges panel.

We moved onto season 15, the end of American idol. They brought back the winners and some fan favorites, had a huge celebration for all the years the show was on there. The judges all came back and everybody celebrated. As the winner, Trent Harmon took on the final title of American idol. And even though, it is the end, it did not give him the push. He thought he was going to get. And he once again with the American idol winners became a failed champion.

American idol stayed gone for over a year, and the general public did miss the show, so Walt Disney purchases the show and brings it back with a more positive and energetic flare. They brought it back with the worst voting system, date. The judges had more power than America, so they got to choose majority of who they’re putting in, when America is the one that should be choosing because we are the ones that buy the albums. I said since day one, this was going to be a failure, if they do not change it back to single elimination instead of group elimination. But American idol decided it was going to do its own thing and push on.

Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan became the new judges of American Idol season 16 through 22

I’m gonna combine the seasons together for the most part, but I’m going to still give them their due and their credibility. Season 16 we saw the winner of Maddie Poppee who also was the wrong winner, because Gabby Barrett who worked third place in the show went on to be a country superstar and was the front runner the entire time. We finally got some thing from one of those shows, but it wasn’t the winner. Unfortunately, the winner went on to be a failed winner again.

Season 17 we saw Laine Hardy someone from previous season come back and capture the title. The Elvis look-alike young country megastar was going to be born, but American idol sat on his album debut, and sat on his music. To the point lane, then became a failed winner and gotten legal trouble, he’s making a return today as we speak. But it may be too late for the young country artist. 

Season 18 the pandemic season, the season that took place with everybody filming from their living room or their bedrooms. We watched as American idol still tried to keep this show relevant with everybody submitting their videos, the judges were on zoom, the contestants were on zoom and we continued to watch this show as just Sam, a young woman with financial issues captured the title. She had a beautiful voice and an incredible presence for someone who was never on the stage. Yet, American Idol dropped the ball with her completely, and she became the worst winner of all time. 
 
We moved onto season 19 when Chayce Beckham, captured the title, he went on to also be a failed winner and not successful in the world of music. He did have one song that slowly climb the charts, but never quite got anywhere. He was brought back many times on the show, but that was the only time you seen or heard of him. Yet, just Sam was still left off the show. And never took the stage.

Season 20 we got the winner of Noah Thompson, the wrong winner of American idol hands-down no questions asked. He captured the title of the show because he was extremely attractive. There was no way that America actually voted him in as the best singer, except they chose him based on his looks. And where did it get us another failed winner American idol is tarnished, I don’t see the show producing a mega star ever again. We have went through so much and yet we’ve gotten nowhere. 
 
But American idol continue to push forward with season 21, that’s when America finally saw firsthand. We claimed wrong winners in the past, but this was hands-down the wrong winner. Iam Tongi American idol’s first Hawaiian winner, went on to accomplish nothing. No music, no album and definitely no concerts. He was awarded the win on this show simply because of the passing of his parent, there is no way that this man beat half of the people that he was going up against. Unfortunately, the winners are final and they claim America’s vote. But this is the first time I questioned 100% whether or not, the show was rigged. They think they were going to get success from this person, no, they are not thinking, marketing wise, American idol went for a sympathetic run instead.

Season 22 another controversy strikes American Idol as Katy Perry the judge is called out for bullying a woman for having a baby and sex under age. Even though that is not what happened, we’re in a world of cancel culture. We’re in a world where people blow up social media and change things. So this will be the last season for Katie Perry as a judge. we went on to Crown the winner of Abi Carter, American idol, normally by this time has pushed their artist to be close to having an album, to get music out there and to captivate the world. But we have yet to see anything or hear anything from this young lady and it just looks like we’re gonna follow the same train of another failed winner.

Season 23 Carrie Underwood American idol. All they need is one mega star to come forward to reconnect the crowd and the audience and build up the history of these legendary winners from the past. Because we have not seen a single successful winner since season 10 and before season six. American Idol has more failed winners than they do champions.","Jennifer Lopez, Ryan Seacrest, Keith Urban, Harry Connick Jr.","american idol , season series juggernaut , one incredible unique

To achieve this it has to be original so you don't think the scripts have been written by a computer programming that cuts and pastes the ""best"" bits out of other series or just rehashes something that's already been done but long enough ago that the key audience won't have seen the original. So it's original by creating a lead character that's a serial killer but he has to be a hero as well or it's going to be a villain in a slasher series. So he's given the **code** which only allows him to kill the really bad guys. He's very intelligent but how's he going to get the information he needs so he can be sure he's targeting a real bad guy who deserves what's coming to him or her? So even though he smart enough to become a top doctor he chooses to become a forensic scientist and work for the police.

106,Invincible,"Animation, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Action & Adventure, Drama",8.6,"What can be said about _Invincible_?  I know!  ""_The Boys_, it ain't.""  
What does that mean?  It means for this series, unlike like the comic book it's patterned after, is lacking in...backbone.  
I find this series detestable in its lameness.  It's lopsided high swearing ratio to a negative degree of gratuity is the essence of overstepping resulting in underachieving.  It's just like that other Netflix series _Vox Machina_.  The animation series seems like it excessively swears in order to try and overshadow its lack of tits & ass...excitement!  Which is a real shame because that means it's falling under the umbrella of DEI/ESG and represent-tay-shone!  Those cancerous influences on entertainment that just keep on deteriorating any hope of garnishing fans, attracting followers, or achieving some sort of agency.  
No one is looking for this series because there is nothing engaging about it, i.e., there is nothing to hold the male gaze.  We can get our fix of violence playing video games.  If we want to hear swearing, then we can call up those same friends we play online with.  That leaves gratuity (tits & ass).  And since DEI, ESG, and representation hold ""respect of gender, skin color, and sexual orientation in such high regard"" as not to offend anyone, THEN that means there is nothing of interest or going to be anything of interest to engage one's want to view said lameness that is this series.  
Those BS statuettes of wokeness rob and will continue to rob entertainment of anything remotely engaging, anticipatory, or (God forbid) inspiring.  It's just one drama after another and that equates boring, boring, BORRRRRINNGGGG!!!! 
I watched the entire 2nd season, and I can honestly say I felt for this season just like I did for the first.  Nothing.  Not a damn thing.  I don't care if there is a 3rd season or when that season will begin, play or end.  It just doesn't, as a straight adult male, do anything for me.  In fact, if you think this series is woke, you haven't read the comic for comparison. The comic is only slightly better, but not by much. 
If you can stomach bland entertainment, then go for it.  If you have anything else you could be doing or watching, I say do that!!  It will infinitely more productive than vegging out to this shite series.

108,Game Of Thrones,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Action & Adventure",8.5,"**The Greatest Story Ever Filmed**

It's nothing new that HBO always have the most ambitious projects around, but from 2011 to 2019 they gradually built what I consider the epitome of quality television, and made history. The highly talented show-runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss took the unadaptable giant books by George R. R. Martin and transformed them into this beautifully constructed show, that something of it's kind was never done before. There are so many layers to this story, so many characters and story arcs intertwining with each other that it seems impossible to grasp one man came up with it all.

The story Martin created is probably one of the better and most detailed and well-crafted stories of all times, and David and Dan's transformation of the story to the TV medium was beautifully handled. There aren't that many shows when you sit and watch an episode and savor every single scene, if it's the content itself or the many small details that were precisely designed for every frame you watch. It takes a little time to get into the show in the beginning, just because it's very different from what we are generally used to. It's one of those shows that from the very first episode until the last it's just one big story so you just need patience to get used to everything that's going on in there, and after that enjoyment is guaranteed. Above all, the thing the show benefited perhaps the most of is the fact that ever since the day they started writing the first script- the complete story from start to finish was compiled in George's head. Not all the details and specifics of course, but the outline and major plot points were invented years ago when he started working on this huge book series, therefore the production knew exactly where to start, where the story is heading and where it ends, which gave consistency to the story from episode 1 to 73, without getting lost in the way with loose threads.

The show gets plenty of criticism for its deviations from the source material season 5 and onwards, but if you just think for a second how enormous this story is it's pretty easy to realize a lot needed to be altered to fit the TV medium, and David and Dan managed to do so while preserving the original essence of Martin's creation, keep the story well constructed and coherent and keep dozens of millions of viewers satisfied, and not only a handful of hard core followers that wanted it to be a page- to-page adaption of the novels. While I enjoyed all the books and didn't agree with a few of the changes they made for the show as well I can see why a lot had to be cut, things don't work the same in books as in television. Considering they knew the ending from the start and the huge amount of details you have to alter just from omitting one storyline if you want to reach the same final goal as the books, I believe it was overall for the best and they knew what they were doing, the story didn't collapse under their hands- at least as far as I'm concerned.

One of the most prominent aspects of this show in my opinion is Ramin Djawadi's masterful score which must be one of the most brilliantly unique works ever for a series (whether it's a series of movies or TV series) not only because of the compositions themselves, which are exceptionally beautiful, but also for how the music evolves throughout the seasons and builds the world of the show hand to hand with the writing, the characters and the setting as the story progresses. Also, the way each motif of the music identifies with a certain aspect of the story, though mostly noticeable in later seasons, tells a complete story on its own. Never seen anything like it.

All these wordy descriptions couldn't however describe the experience of watching this show live as it aired. The thrill, the off-season anticipation and continuous speculations, the satisfaction of watching a new amazing episode after waiting for so long, the 8-years-long water-cooler talks and the overall influence GoT had on pop culture in the time it was on TV- I'm sure many of us will always remember how it felt, and I'm not sure if we'll get to experience something like that anytime soon. I already watched each season several times, probably more than any other show or movie, and I never get tired of any of it, if it's the well constructed dialogues or blood pumping action sequences. I definitely see myself still constantly revisiting seasons every once in a while from now until further notice.

I think the success of the show speaks for itself- the countless awards, high acclaim from casual viewers and critics alike, the major fan following, it's influences on the television landscape and on culture in general- it's a winner in all fronts. In my personal opinion it's the greatest television series ever made, but generally speaking I think it's safe to say this show is for the ages and I think it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest cinematic works ever produced. Even almost 2 years after the show ended, it still remains one of the most popular and in-demand shows in the world, which I find pretty amazing. I just hope the uproar on social media will calm down eventually so we can once again all enjoy this show together. People tend to use this word too cheaply these days, but I wouldn't say Game of Thrones is anything short of a masterpiece.","Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke","* * greatest story ever film * * 's nothing new hbo always ambitious project around , 2011 2019 gradually build consider epitome quality television , make history . highly talented show-runners david benioff dan weiss take unadaptable giant book george r. r. martin transform beautifully construct show , something 's kind never do . many layer story , many character story arc intertwine seem impossible grasp one man come . story martin create probably one better detail well-crafted stories time , david dan 's transformation story tv medium beautifully handle . n't many show sit watch episode savor every single scene , 's content many small detail precisely design every frame watch . take little time get show begin , 's different generally use .

108,Game Of Thrones,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Action & Adventure",8.5,"**A series so massive and absorbing that it seems small on television.**

What can we say about a television series that everyone has said everything about and that, over almost a decade, has collected almost every award it could win? Nothing special. Only that he fully deserved all the awards and public esteem he acquired. Each season deserved, in itself, its own review, but I feel that there is no point in adding more than this small text about the overall work done. Almost everyone has seen the series, and the praise is known to everyone.

The numbers behind this series are overwhelming. With each episode costing millions of dollars to make, a luxurious cast and a script so complex that it requires the public's full attention, we are faced with a work that seems worthy of the cinema and is better than many large-production films we have already seen. . The story told is based on the epic fantasy books written by George R. R. Martin, who actively collaborated on the series and is one of those most responsible for the script, heavily inspired by loose pieces of medieval European history. About this, it is necessary to understand one thing: despite the inspirations and violence and rivalries that were in fact common in medieval times, at no point does the series try to be a portrait of medieval Europe, it is absolutely fiction and should be seen that way : For example, the series pays some attention to heraldry and the genealogy of noble families, but very few heraldic shields were made according to the simpler rules of true heraldry.

The production and visual effects of the series are one of its strong points: the episodes are so good and impactful that it is difficult to imagine how anything better could be done. All the technology used is state of the art today, and no savings were made in the resources made available to creators. Filming took place across Europe, from Ireland to Spain, passing through Morocco, England and Croatia, taking advantage of the best of locations that, in themselves, are entirely worth a visit for any tourist. The sets could not have been designed with greater attention to detail, and the same can be said of the luxurious costumes for the main cast and thousands of extras. The photography, the filming, the editing, everything was thought out on a large scale. The soundtrack, based on the main song and some other magnificent melodies, is one of the best I've ever seen on a television program.

The actors are immense throughout the eight seasons, and we can hardly say anything negative about any of them. We may disagree with the choices in the script, with the way the characters were developed, but the actors were completely up to these challenges and managed them wonderfully. We can also criticize, with some fairness, the graphic brutality of certain scenes, the excessive nudity and the abuse of the sex scenes. This is the negative criticism with which I tend to agree most easily, not least because I don't see anything in these scenes that would be indispensable to the plot in most cases (I would highlight, as one of the exceptions, Cersei's nudity during her punishing walk through the streets of King's Landing).

On a positive note, I would highlight the impeccable effort of Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster Waldau, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Alfie Allen, Isaac Hempstead Wright and Rory McCann. Not only did they play incredibly well, they gave their characters the dramatic and psychological evolution they needed. It is also fair to congratulate Sean Bean, Kit Harington, John Bradley, Conleth Hill, Aidan Gillen, Carice van Houten, Charles Dance, Natalie Dormer and Jack Gleeson, who had much more stable and fixed characters in their hands. Some were more cliché (the case of crazy King Joffrey), but each actor deserves praise.","Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke","* * series massive absorb seem small television . * * say television series everyone say everything , almost decade , collect almost every award could win ? nothing special . fully deserve award public esteem acquire . season deserve , , review , feel point add small text overall work do . almost everyone see series , praise know everyone . number behind series overwhelm . episode cost millions dollars make , luxurious cast script complex require public 's full attention , face work seem worthy cinema better many large-production film already see . . story tell base epic fantasy book write george r. r. martin , actively collaborate series one responsible script , heavily inspire loose piece medieval european history . , necessary understand one thing : despite inspirations violence rivalries fact common medieval time , point series try portrait medieval europe , absolutely fiction see way : example , series pay attention heraldry genealogy noble families , heraldic shield make accord simpler rule true heraldry . production visual effect series one strong point : episodes good impactful difficult imagine anything better could do . technology use state art today , savings make resources make available creators . film take place across europe , ireland spain , pass morocco , england croatia , take advantage best locations , , entirely worth visit tourist . set could design greater attention detail , say luxurious costume main cast thousands extras . photography , film , edit , everything think large scale . soundtrack , base main song magnificent melodies , one best 've ever see television program . actors immense throughout eight season , hardly say anything negative . may disagree choices script , way character develop , actors completely challenge manage wonderfully . also criticize , fairness , graphic brutality certain scenes , excessive nudity abuse sex scenes . negative criticism tend agree easily , least n't see anything scenes would indispensable plot case ( would highlight , one exceptions , cersei 's nudity punish walk streets king 's land ) . positive note , would highlight impeccable effort peter dinklage , emilia clarke , lena headey , nikolaj coster waldau , sophie turner , maisie williams , alfie allen , isaac hempstead wright rory mccann . play incredibly well , give character dramatic psychological evolution need . also fair congratulate sean bean , kit harington , john bradley , conleth hill , aidan gillen , carice van houten , charles dance , natalie dormer jack gleeson , much stable fix character hand . cliché ( case crazy king joffrey ) , actor deserve praise .",1,1
108,Game Of Thrones,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Action & Adventure",8.5,"HBO's sprawling fantasy epic, Game of Thrones (2011), isn't for the faint of heart. It plunges viewers into the harsh, mysterious world of Westeros, a land steeped in ancient traditions and brutal power struggles. What truly elevates the series, however, is its ability to leverage this captivating setting to explore complex, often disturbing, facets of humanity.

The series excels at world-building. Westeros feels tangible, its vast landscapes and intricate political machinations drawing you in. There's a constant sense of unease, a feeling that something dark lurks beneath the surface. This unsettling atmosphere is masterfully used as a backdrop to explore very real, contemporary issues – the lust for power, the devastating consequences of war, and the depths of human cruelty.

Be prepared, however, for characters who are rarely one-dimensional heroes or villains. Game of Thrones thrives on moral ambiguity. You'll encounter characters who are capable of immense kindness and horrific acts in equal measure. This can be a harsh and even disgusting reality to grapple with, but it's a testament to the show's writing and acting that it can evoke such strong emotions. You'll find yourself feeling deeply invested in the characters' fates, celebrating their victories and mourning their losses.

The emotional rollercoaster is a defining aspect of Game of Thrones. It's a series that demands your full attention, rewarding viewers who stay the course with an unforgettable journey filled with heart-pounding battles, shocking twists, and moments of genuine beauty. While the later seasons may not have lived up to the sky-high expectations set by the early installments, the overall experience remains undeniably gripping.

In conclusion, Game of Thrones is a landmark television achievement. With its rich setting, unflinching portrayal of human nature, and ability to evoke a wide range of emotions, it's a series that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Just be prepared for a wild ride, filled with both exhilarating highs and soul-crushing lows.","Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke","hbo 's sprawl fantasy epic , game throne ( 2011 ) , n't faint heart . plunge viewers harsh , mysterious world westeros , land steep ancient traditions brutal power struggle . truly elevate series , however , ability leverage captivate set explore complex , often disturb , facets humanity . series excel world-building . westeros feel tangible , vast landscape intricate political machinations draw .

## **Why Supernatural Endured for 15 Seasons**

Fifteen seasons. Over 300 episodes. That’s not just a show—it’s a legacy. *Supernatural* wasn’t just about monster hunts or witty one-liners (though it had plenty of those). It was about two brothers, their iconic Chevy Impala, and the kind of storytelling that digs deep, pulls at your heart, and keeps you hooked until the very end.

At its core, *Supernatural* was a masterclass in blending horror, humor, and raw emotion. It’s no surprise the *SPN Family*remains as passionate as ever—because this show wasn’t just something you watched, it was something you *felt*. Whether the Winchester brothers were fighting demons or angels, it was always about their bond. That’s the heartbeat of *Supernatural*.

So what made *Supernatural* stand out? From the unforgettable chemistry between Sam and Dean to the perfect mix of epic mythology and iconic episodes, *Supernatural* earned its place as one of TV’s greatest—and even after 15 seasons, we still can’t stop talking about it.

---

## **Sam and Dean: The Unbreakable Bond at Supernatural’s Core**

At the center of *Supernatural* is one undeniable truth: this show is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean Winchester. Sure, they’ve battled everything from shape-shifters to archangels, but the real fight has always been for each other. Their bond goes beyond just being brothers—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and that deep, unspoken connection that keeps them pushing forward no matter the cost.

Sam and Dean aren’t just characters—they’ve become a blueprint for what makes a dynamic duo truly great. Dean, with his tough-as-nails exterior and unshakeable devotion, and Sam, the thoughtful, conflicted younger brother trying to balance family duty with his own desires, are the emotional heartbeat of the series. Together, they aren’t just fighting monsters—they’re fighting fate, destiny, and everything in between.

What makes their relationship so powerful is the constant tug-of-war between their deep love for one another and the weight of the sacrifices they make. Each of them has literally gone to Hell and back for the other, and these moments of sacrifice hit hard because they feel real. It’s the kind of relationship that sticks with you long after the credits roll. No matter how intense the monster hunts get, it’s always the quieter, more intimate moments between Sam and Dean that resonate the most.

The Winchester brothers are the reason we keep coming back. Their chemistry is electric, their struggles are relatable, and their bond is unbreakable. At the end of the day, *Supernatural* isn’t just about saving the world—it’s about saving each other, and that’s what makes it special.

---

## **A Perfect Blend: Horror, Comedy, Drama, and Heart**

*Supernatural* is a masterclass in genre-blending. This show doesn’t just play in one sandbox—it takes over the entire playground. Horror? Check. Comedy? Absolutely. Drama? You bet. And somehow, it manages to weave all of these elements together without missing a beat.

Let’s start with the horror. We’re talking everything from classic ghost hunts to full-on battles with demons and angels. The scares are real, but *Supernatural* never leans too hard into the gloom. Just when you’re clutching your blanket, Dean drops a snarky one-liner or Castiel gives you that wonderfully deadpan confusion, and suddenly you’re laughing. It’s this perfect pivot between tension and humor that keeps the show fresh and—dare I say it—fun.

But here’s where *Supernatural* really nails it: the heart. Beneath all the monster slaying and apocalyptic drama, this is a show about family and sacrifice. Every episode, no matter how wild the plot gets, is anchored by Sam and Dean’s relationship. They’ll literally go to Hell (and back) for each other, and the emotional depth that brings is what turns a good show into a great one.

The genius of *Supernatural* is that it never lets one genre overpower the others. It’s as comfortable delivering gut-punching emotional moments as it is making you jump out of your seat or burst out laughing. And that balance? That’s why fans keep coming back—because with *Supernatural*, you’re getting the best of every world.

---

## **The *Supernatural* Mythology: From Urban Legends to Apocalyptic Battles**

If you thought *Supernatural* was just about hunting ghosts and taking down demons, think again. This show goes all-in when it comes to mythology—pulling from urban legends, religious lore, and just about every spooky story you’ve ever heard whispered around a campfire. It’s like a folklore buffet, and *Supernatural* serves it up hot.

The early seasons keep it tight with classic monster-of-the-week vibes: wendigos, shapeshifters, cursed mirrors—you name it, Sam and Dean have faced it. But here’s where the show really flexes its creative muscles. As it grows, so does the mythology, until we’re no longer just talking about salt lines and silver bullets. Suddenly, we’re dealing with fallen angels, biblical prophecies, and—oh yeah—Lucifer himself. This isn’t your average horror show; this is epic, universe-spanning storytelling.

*Supernatural* does what few other shows manage—it constantly raises the stakes without collapsing under the weight of its own lore. It takes bold swings. One season, you’re dealing with a local haunting, the next, you’re questioning the very nature of free will and destiny as Sam and Dean go toe-to-toe with God. Yeah, it gets that big. But no matter how grand the mythology gets, the story never forgets where it started—on the road, in that Impala, with two brothers just trying to survive.

The genius lies in the balance. The show dances between grounded urban legends and sweeping, cosmic battles, and somehow, it all works. The lore isn’t just background noise either—it’s integral to the emotional weight of the series. Every demon exorcised, every angelic encounter adds layers to Sam and Dean’s journey, and by the end, you’re not just watching a TV show—you’re knee-deep in a modern myth.

---

## **Character Growth and Evolution: From Hunters to Heroes**

Let’s get one thing straight—*Supernatural* wouldn’t be the powerhouse it is without its incredible character work. Sure, the monsters, demons, and angels are fun, but it’s the characters that keep us coming back. Over 15 seasons, these aren’t just hunters—they’re heroes, villains, and everything in between, evolving in ways that make them feel real and raw.

We’ve got Sam and Dean, obviously, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. *Supernatural* thrives because it fills its world with characters who are as complex as they are iconic, whether they’re wielding a blade, throwing a sarcastic quip, or breaking your heart in ways you didn’t see coming.

### **The Winchester Brothers: Heart of the Show**

Let’s start where it all began: Sam and Dean. These two aren’t just brothers—they’re the emotional core of the entire series. From episode one, it’s clear their bond is what makes this show different. Sure, they fight demons and battle the apocalypse on a regular basis, but at the end of the day, *Supernatural* is a story about family.

Dean, the hardened, tough-love protector, grows from a cocky hunter into a deeply vulnerable character, grappling with self-worth and purpose. His bravado might be the surface, but underneath is a man who’d throw himself into Hell (literally) for the people he loves. Dean is a walking paradox: a man who craves love but feels he doesn’t deserve it. By the end, his arc feels like an emotional marathon—you’ve seen him win, lose, and keep fighting even when all hope is gone.

And then there’s Sam. The younger Winchester brother starts out wanting nothing to do with the hunter life, but as the series progresses, we watch him become the moral compass, even when that means making brutal sacrifices. He wrestles with dark powers, addiction, and self-doubt, but somehow, Sam always finds his way back to the fight. His journey from idealistic college kid to seasoned hero with a complicated past makes him one of the most dynamic characters on TV.

### **Bobby Singer: The Reluctant Mentor Turned Father Figure**

Bobby Singer didn’t just help Sam and Dean fight monsters—he taught them how to survive in a world where evil was as constant as the rising sun. From the moment Bobby entered their lives, he wasn’t just another hunter in the background; he became the mentor they needed after losing their father. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural and his no-nonsense approach to hunting, Bobby became the man the brothers could turn to when things got rough, a guiding voice when John Winchester’s strict code of survival wasn’t enough.

What made Bobby stand out was that he wasn’t a stereotypical mentor. He was gruff, stubborn, and unapologetically real. But beneath that tough exterior, Bobby had a heart of gold—and a deep, almost paternal love for Sam and Dean. He didn’t just teach them how to fight; he taught them how to think. Bobby wasn’t afraid to call the boys out on their mistakes, pushing them to be better hunters, better brothers, and better men.

And let’s not forget his intellectual prowess. Bobby was the go-to source for lore, rituals, and all things supernatural. When Sam and Dean were stumped, Bobby had the answers, usually found buried in one of his many old, dusty books. His combination of intellect and heart made him indispensable to the Winchester’s journey.

More than anything, Bobby’s presence grounded Sam and Dean. He was their anchor, the one person who wasn’t afraid to show them tough love while also being the emotional support they so desperately needed. He wasn’t just a hunter or a friend—he was family, shaping the brothers into the heroes they would ultimately become

### **Castiel: The Angel Who Fell (In More Ways Than One)**

Now, let’s talk about *Castiel*, the angel who became so much more than just a celestial being. Castiel starts out as a soldier of Heaven, but his journey quickly takes him down a more human path. He learns about loyalty, sacrifice, and love—not from the angels above, but from Sam and Dean.

Castiel’s evolution is one of the most emotionally satisfying parts of the series. His deadpan humor and awkward attempts to understand human behavior give the show some of its best comedic moments, but it’s his growing humanity that really tugs at the heartstrings. He transforms from a rigid, obedient angel to a fiercely loyal friend, even when it means defying Heaven’s orders. By the end, Castiel isn’t just an angel—he’s family. His ultimate sacrifice, fueled by love, is one of the show’s most heartbreaking and powerful moments, cementing his place as a fan favorite.

### **Crowley: The Demon with a Heart (Maybe)**

Now, enter *Crowley*, the self-proclaimed “King of Hell” who somehow becomes one of the most beloved characters in the show. Crowley isn’t your typical villain—he’s equal parts sinister and hilarious, wielding sarcasm like a weapon. He dances in the grey area between good and evil, forming uneasy alliances with Sam and Dean that blur the lines of morality. Crowley’s evolution is wild: from ruthless demon to someone who shows flashes of loyalty and, dare I say, compassion. He’s the bad guy you hate to love, but can’t stop rooting for. The man makes deals with souls, but still manages to feel like a necessary part of the Winchester family.

### **Lucifer: The Devil in the Details**

And speaking of villains—let’s not forget *Lucifer*. You’d expect the Devil to be all fire and brimstone, but *Supernatural*gives us a version of him that’s sharp-tongued, manipulative, and, oddly enough, a little charismatic. He’s the ultimate Big Bad, but Lucifer’s complexity goes deeper than just being evil incarnate. He’s a character who feels betrayed, cast aside by his own father (God), and, as twisted as it sounds, you almost *get* him. Almost. Lucifer is unpredictable in the best way—one minute, he’s terrifying, and the next, he’s delivering one of the funniest lines in the show. That’s the beauty of *Supernatural*—even the most sinister characters have layers.

### **Rowena: Witch with Ambition**

Let’s talk about *Rowena*. If you thought Crowley was complicated, his mother takes it to another level. Rowena starts out as a cunning, ruthless witch who’s only out for herself. But over time, she evolves into something much more intriguing—a fiercely independent character who eventually shows depth beyond her manipulative facade. Rowena’s growth from power-hungry villain to someone capable of sacrifice gives us one of the richest character arcs in the series. Plus, her sharp tongue and witty one-liners make every scene she’s in a delight. Rowena is the kind of character who proves that even the baddest of witches can change—if only on her own terms.

### **Charlie Bradbury: The Nerdy Hero We Needed**

Charlie Bradbury was the fandom’s heart, the geek girl who jumped into the Winchester world and held her own. A brilliant hacker turned hunter, she brought an infectious energy to the series. Charlie was quirky, brave, and endlessly resourceful. Her relationship with Sam and Dean evolved into something like family—proving that not all bonds in *Supernatural* are forged in blood. Charlie represented the fan in all of us, geeking out over LARPing one minute and slaying monsters the next. Her tragic end hit hard because we saw so much of ourselves in her—a reminder that in *Supernatural*, no one is safe, not even the ones who make us smile the most

*Supernatural*’s genius lies in its characters—each one layered, each one evolving in unexpected ways. Whether it’s Dean battling inner demons, Sam wrestling with impossible choices, or Crowley and Rowena walking the tightrope between villain and ally, every character brings something vital to the table. It’s the humanity behind these larger-than-life figures that makes *Supernatural* more than just a show about monsters—it’s a show about people, family, and the impossible lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.

## **The Classic Rock Soundtrack and Baby: The Heart and Soul of *Supernatural***

Let’s get one thing straight—*Supernatural* wouldn’t be *Supernatural* without its [killer classic rock soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7jbyn1EOcBopLl6SXISNYx?si=ZVoIA0FNTd2Q79YWRyXU4A&pi=u-okiyK605QK6L) and the Impala, better known as “Baby.” These aren’t just fun add-ons; they’re core characters in the show’s DNA. Dean’s love for classic rock and his dedication to Baby go beyond fandom quirks—they’re extensions of who he is, and by extension, what the show is all about.

First, the music. You hear the opening chords of Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” and suddenly, you’re not just watching a show—you’re stepping into an epic, fifteen-season journey. It’s the unofficial anthem of the Winchesters, and it hits with emotional weight every time it plays. But it doesn’t stop there. *Supernatural* treats classic rock like a gospel, with Dean as its faithful preacher. Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bob Seger—it’s all there. Whether it’s “Back in Black” roaring through an Impala montage or the bittersweet notes of Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” during one of those rare reflective moments, the music has always been the show’s soul.

And let’s not forget “Night Moves.” When Dean and Sam share a rare, carefree moment belting out Bob Seger’s iconic track in the car, it’s not just two brothers passing time—it’s a reminder that even in the middle of hunting monsters and fighting the apocalypse, they’re still human. They still *feel*. These songs aren’t just background noise—they’re emotional markers that tell the story as much as the dialogue does.

This soundtrack does more than fill silence—it gives the show its heartbeat. Dean rolling down the highway to “Back in Black” feels like a declaration. This isn’t just a random playlist; it’s a soundtrack with soul. And for the fans who grew up with these songs, it’s a nostalgic goldmine, bringing together the thrill of adventure and the comfort of familiarity in every riff and guitar solo. Whether it’s Rush’s “Working Man” pounding through an action-packed scene or “Renegade” by Styx building up to one of the show’s more tense moments, the music elevates the storytelling every single time.

Now, let’s talk about Baby—the *other* constant in Sam and Dean’s lives. This 1967 Chevy Impala isn’t just a car; she’s a Winchester in her own right. Baby is as much a part of the show as any character. She’s been through every monster hunt, every road trip, and every heartbreak. Dean’s love for her is more than just the pride of owning a classic car—Baby is home. She’s where the brothers retreat when the world gets too heavy, where they talk out their next move or sit in quiet, reflective moments while the radio hums with classic rock.

And then there’s the legendary episode “Baby,” where we get an entire story told from her perspective. It’s genius because it shows us what we’ve always known—Baby isn’t just a backdrop, she’s *central* to the Winchesters’ lives. Every dent, scratch, and repair tells a story. She’s carried them through battles with demons, angels, and even Death itself, and yet, no matter how bad things get, Baby keeps on rolling.

The best moments in *Supernatural* often come when the Impala tears down the road, music blaring, and you realize it’s more than just a scene—it’s the embodiment of freedom. When Bob Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” plays during quieter moments, it adds depth to the boys’ story. These aren’t just two guys saving the world—they’re two guys who’ve lost, who’ve sacrificed, and who still get back in that car and keep driving.

And let’s not forget how integral these two elements—music and Baby—are to the fans. Every time we hear “Carry On Wayward Son” or see the Impala glide through a night-lit highway, it brings us back to the heart of *Supernatural*: family, loyalty, and the idea that no matter how bad things get, you don’t stop fighting. The music and Baby are reminders that the Winchesters always keep moving forward. The music gives the show its pulse, and Baby? She gives it its heart.

Together, Baby and the soundtrack represent more than just cool cars and great music—they symbolize the unbreakable bond between the brothers and the freedom of life on the road. Dean’s devotion to Baby is about more than metal and wheels—it’s about roots, history, and the one constant in a life filled with chaos. And the classic rock soundtrack? It’s the spirit of *Supernatural*, carrying us through every battle, every tear, and every victory.

So yeah, Baby might just be a car and the music might just be a bunch of rock tracks, but in *Supernatural*, they’re everything. Together, they make the Winchesters’ journey more than just a fight against evil—they make it a road trip you never want to end.

## **The Balance Between Monster-of-the-Week, Epic Mythology, and Meta Episodes**

If *Supernatural* had stuck to just one formula, it wouldn’t have lasted 15 seasons. What makes this show work so brilliantly is its ability to walk the line between gripping standalone episodes (the infamous “monster-of-the-week” format), sprawling multi-season myth arcs, and bold, fourth-wall-breaking meta episodes that drag you deeper into the *Supernatural* universe with a wink and a smirk. This is a balancing act most shows can’t pull off—but *Supernatural*makes it look effortless.

The *monster-of-the-week* episodes are where the show leans into its roots. These are the stories that feel like urban legends brought to life: Wendigos, shapeshifters, Bloody Mary—all the creatures you grew up fearing—*Supernatural*served them up with eerie intensity. These episodes kept the show grounded, reminding us that no matter how high the stakes got, at its heart, it was about two brothers solving mysteries in the dark.

But then, *Supernatural* did something even smarter—it built a mythos that stretched far beyond the usual ghost story. As the series unfolded, it cracked open a bigger mythology, introducing demons, angels, Lucifer, and eventually, God Himself. And it wasn’t just expanding the stakes—it was creating an entire universe. That seamless switch from local hauntings to biblical showdowns is what gives the series its epic scale. The transition from “what’s that creepy thing in the dark?” to “oh, we’re fighting the actual apocalypse now” shouldn’t have worked this well. But somehow, it did.

Then came the secret weapon: *Supernatural*’s ability to laugh at itself. The show broke the fourth wall like no other, delivering *meta* episodes that poked fun at its own genre, fandom, and even its actors. These episodes weren’t just gimmicks—they were masterclasses in self-awareness, using humor to not only keep the audience entertained but also to highlight the show’s versatility. Episodes like “The French Mistake,” where Sam and Dean are tossed into an alternate universe where they’re actors in a TV show called *Supernatural*, are the perfect blend of absurdity and cleverness. You’ve got the Winchesters trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki poke fun at their real lives. It’s a ridiculous concept, but it works—and it’s just one example of how the show seamlessly merged its deep, emotional storytelling with moments of pure comedic genius.

But it didn’t stop there. Whether it was “Changing Channels,” which hilariously transported Sam and Dean through various TV show genres (hello, sitcom laugh track), or “Fan Fiction,” which took meta to a whole new level by turning the spotlight on the *Supernatural* fandom, these episodes dared to break the rules of traditional TV. And yet, even while poking fun at itself, the show never lost sight of its core themes: family, destiny, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.

These *meta* episodes gave the show room to breathe between the high-stakes mythology arcs and the creature-hunting adventures, allowing for moments of levity and creativity that kept fans hooked. One week, you’re watching Sam and Dean battle a vengeful spirit, and the next, they’re trapped in a fake version of their own lives or hilariously battling their way through TV parodies. And the best part? It never felt out of place. *Supernatural* had built such a flexible, layered world that even the most outlandish episodes fit into its broader narrative.

The show’s humor and willingness to poke fun at its own genre only strengthened its bond with fans. We weren’t just watching two brothers take on the apocalypse; we were in on the joke, laughing along as the writers playfully deconstructed the show’s own tropes. The fourth-wall-breaking episodes added a new dimension to the series, proving that *Supernatural* wasn’t afraid to take risks, mock itself, or fully embrace the weird.

Whether you’re watching an emotional myth arc about Heaven and Hell, a spooky creature-of-the-week, or a meta episode that leaves you laughing out loud, *Supernatural* mastered the art of keeping its audience on their toes. One moment you’re on the edge of your seat, the next you’re in stitches—but no matter what, you’re invested. That’s the magic of this show: the perfect balance of humor, horror, and heart.

## **Family and Sacrifice: The Heartbeat of *Supernatural***

“Saving people, hunting things—the family business.” It’s more than a catchphrase. For the Winchesters, it’s a creed. Right from the first episode, *Supernatural* drives home the fact that the Winchester family isn’t like most others. They don’t sit down for Sunday dinners or swap happy holiday stories. Their legacy is blood-soaked, hard-earned, and filled with impossible choices. For Sam and Dean, family isn’t just about genetics—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and the willingness to walk into hell (sometimes literally) to save the people you love.

But *Supernatural* doesn’t stop at biological bonds. While the show’s emotional center is Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection, it constantly reminds us that family is about more than blood. From Bobby Singer to Castiel, Charlie Bradbury to Jodie Mills, the Winchesters build a found family around them, one forged in battle and trust.

Bobby isn’t just the grizzled hunter who helps from the sidelines. He’s the father figure the brothers desperately needed after losing their own. And when Bobby sacrifices everything to protect Sam and Dean, it’s not out of duty—it’s love. His gruff “idjits” is always laced with affection, making his inevitable departure one of the series’ most heartbreaking moments. For Bobby, family meant being willing to give everything, even when there was nothing left to give.

Then there’s Castiel. The angel who started off as Heaven’s loyal soldier quickly became something far more complex—a brother in arms, a friend, and ultimately, family. Castiel’s arc is one of the most poignant examples of *Supernatural*‘s exploration of loyalty. His decision to fall from grace, to fight alongside the Winchesters instead of against them, represents the power of chosen family. Castiel’s ultimate sacrifice for Dean—driven by love, not duty—solidifies his place as a Winchester, proving that sometimes, the strongest family ties aren’t the ones we’re born with, but the ones we create.

And who could forget the fierce women of *Supernatural*? Charlie Bradbury might not have been born into the hunter life, but she earned her place through loyalty and guts. As a geeky, fearless hacker turned badass hunter, Charlie shows us that family can be chosen. Her bond with the Winchesters ran deep, and her tragic end still stings because she wasn’t just a friend—she was family. Jodie Mills, on the other hand, stepped into the role of protector, becoming a mother figure to a new generation of hunters. She didn’t have to take these lost girls under her wing, but she did because, in *Supernatural*, family is about showing up when no one else will.

Time and time again, *Supernatural* shows us that family means sacrifice. The Winchesters ask themselves the hard question: how far would you go for the people you love? And the answer is always: further than you think. Whether it’s Dean making deals with demons to save Sam, or Sam risking his life to pull Dean from the brink, their story is one of selflessness—sometimes to a fault.

And that’s where the real beauty of the show lies. It’s not just about hunting monsters or saving the world. It’s about the people you’re willing to stand beside in the fight. It’s about the love, loyalty, and sacrifice that define the Winchester legacy. Because in *Supernatural*, family isn’t just a bond—it’s a battle. And even when the stakes are cosmic, it always comes down to saving people and hunting things, because that’s the family business.

## **The Fandom That Kept It Alive: The Power of the SPN Family**

When we talk about *Supernatural*’s unprecedented 15-season run, there’s one undeniable force that carried the show through every twist, turn, and apocalyptic showdown: the *SPN Family*. It’s more than just a fanbase—this community of devoted viewers, creators, and passionate advocates became the backbone of *Supernatural*, driving its success and influencing the way fandoms interact with television today. From launching fan campaigns to attending conventions, the *SPN Family* didn’t just support the show—they helped shape it.

What makes *Supernatural* unique is how it built this loyal, worldwide following, despite starting off as an under-the-radar series on The WB (remember that network?). Back in 2005, *Supernatural* premiered to modest ratings, with no guarantee it would survive past its first season. The show might have flown under the radar of the mainstream critics, but the fans? They saw something special.

It wasn’t long before the *SPN Family* transformed into a cultural powerhouse, keeping *Supernatural* alive through low ratings, network shifts, and even a writer’s strike. While some shows rely solely on their storylines or cast to stay afloat, *Supernatural* had something extra: a fanbase that wasn’t afraid to fight for it. These weren’t casual viewers tuning in once a week—they were engaged, connected, and fiercely loyal.

Fan conventions were one of the biggest drivers behind this loyalty. Year after year, conventions like *Creation Entertainment’s Salute to Supernatural* became pilgrimage spots for fans to meet their favorite cast members, share their art, theories, and stories, and celebrate their love for the show. For many, these events were more than just photo-ops or autograph sessions—they were community-building hubs. Here, fans bonded over their shared love of all things Winchester, forming friendships and creating memories that transcended the screen.

But what truly sets the *SPN Family* apart is its activism. The fans didn’t just watch and engage—they gave back. From charity drives inspired by the cast to campaigns like *Random Acts* (founded by Misha Collins, the actor behind Castiel), the *SPN Family* showed that they were willing to take their love for the show and channel it into positive real-world change. It’s this deeper level of engagement that sets them apart from your average fandom.

And here’s the thing—the *Supernatural* team *knew* how much the fandom mattered. They weren’t just passive observers—they embraced the *SPN Family*, making them a part of the narrative. Episodes like “Fan Fiction” and “The Monster at the End of This Book” celebrated the fans in a way no other series had done before, blending real-life fandom with the fictional world of the Winchesters. In the meta episodes, the show didn’t just break the fourth wall—it leaned into it, acknowledging fan fiction, fan theories, and even shipping (Dean/Cas, anyone?) with a wink and a nod.

More than once, the *SPN Family* made the impossible happen. After all, it was fan dedication that helped push *Supernatural* into its 15th season, a feat almost unheard of in genre television. And when the show finally aired its last episode, the fandom didn’t just disappear. The community, built over 15 years of love, continues to thrive through fan projects, conventions, and online spaces dedicated to keeping the *Supernatural* spirit alive.

In an age where shows often live and die by network decisions or fluctuating ratings, *Supernatural* proved that the voice of the fans could be louder than any number crunching in a studio boardroom. The *SPN Family* wasn’t just a group of people who liked a show—they were the fuel that kept the engine running, year after year, apocalypse after apocalypse.

So, while the Winchesters may have closed the final chapter of their story, the *SPN Family* ensures that the legacy of *Supernatural* lives on. It’s a testament to the power of community, proving that when fans truly care, they can keep a story alive well beyond its final credits.

## **The Legacy of *Supernatural***

When the curtains finally closed on *Supernatural* after a monumental 15-season run, it was clear the show had left behind more than just a string of successful episodes. It had built a universe, a community, and a legacy that reshaped how genre TV could be experienced. What started as a story about two brothers hunting monsters morphed into a saga that dived deep into mythology, human emotion, and, most importantly, the concept of family—both by blood and by choice.

The show’s impact isn’t just measured by its episode count or ratings—it’s about the lives it touched. For many fans, *Supernatural* became more than just a weekly watch; it was a constant through the ups and downs of their lives. The show’s exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what’s right, even when it’s hard, resonated deeply. It gave viewers more than just entertainment—it offered comfort and a sense of belonging.

And let’s not forget the way *Supernatural* evolved the landscape of TV storytelling. It mixed procedural elements with an ongoing mythology in a way that allowed it to flex between epic apocalyptic plots and intimate character-driven moments. It embraced a *meta* sense of humor that blurred the line between fiction and reality, giving fans episodes that felt like inside jokes shared by a family—fitting for a show that always came back to the theme of familial bonds.

As for the cast, they weren’t just characters on a screen. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and the rest became household names, in no small part due to the accessibility and warmth they showed to their fans. It’s rare for a cast to engage so fully with their audience, and that, perhaps, is *Supernatural*’s real magic. The sense of community fostered between the creators, cast, and audience is something most shows can only dream of achieving. It’s why, even after the final episode aired, the *SPN Family* continues to thrive.

At its core, *Supernatural* was about more than just hunting monsters or saving the world. It was about connection—the connection between characters, the connection between the show and its audience, and the connections it fostered between fans around the globe. For 15 years, *Supernatural* wasn’t just a show; it was a phenomenon. And in that time, it proved one truth above all else: that family doesn’t end in blood","Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Misha Collins","# * * 15 years save people , hunt things : supernatural phenomenon * * #

**Why Supernatural Endured for 15 Seasons**
Fifteen seasons. Over 300 episodes. That’s not just a show—it’s a legacy. _Supernatural_ wasn’t just about monster hunts or witty one-liners (though it had plenty of those). It was about two brothers, their iconic Chevy Impala, and the kind of storytelling that digs deep, pulls at your heart, and keeps you hooked until the very end.

At its core, _Supernatural_ was a masterclass in blending horror, humor, and raw emotion. It’s no surprise the SPN Family remains as passionate as ever—because this show wasn’t just something you watched, it was something you felt. Whether the Winchester brothers were fighting demons or angels, it was always about their bond. That’s the heartbeat of _Supernatural_.

So what made _Supernatural_ stand out? From the unforgettable chemistry between Sam and Dean to the perfect mix of epic mythology and iconic episodes, _Supernatural_ earned its place as one of TV’s greatest—and even after 15 seasons, we still can’t stop talking about it.

**Sam and Dean: The Unbreakable Bond at Supernatural’s Core**
At the center of _Supernatural_ is one undeniable truth: this show is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean Winchester. Sure, they’ve battled everything from shape-shifters to archangels, but the real fight has always been for each other. Their bond goes beyond just being brothers—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and that deep, unspoken connection that keeps them pushing forward no matter the cost.

Sam and Dean aren’t just characters—they’ve become a blueprint for what makes a dynamic duo truly great. Dean, with his tough-as-nails exterior and unshakeable devotion, and Sam, the thoughtful, conflicted younger brother trying to balance family duty with his own desires, are the emotional heartbeat of the series. Together, they aren’t just fighting monsters—they’re fighting fate, destiny, and everything in between.

What makes their relationship so powerful is the constant tug-of-war between their deep love for one another and the weight of the sacrifices they make. Each of them has literally gone to Hell and back for the other, and these moments of sacrifice hit hard because they feel real. It’s the kind of relationship that sticks with you long after the credits roll. No matter how intense the monster hunts get, it’s always the quieter, more intimate moments between Sam and Dean that resonate the most.

The Winchester brothers are the reason we keep coming back. Their chemistry is electric, their struggles are relatable, and their bond is unbreakable. At the end of the day, _Supernatural_ isn’t just about saving the world—it’s about saving each other, and that’s what makes it special.

**A Perfect Blend: Horror, Comedy, Drama, and Heart**
_Supernatural_ is a masterclass in genre-blending. This show doesn’t just play in one sandbox—it takes over the entire playground. Horror? Check. Comedy? Absolutely. Drama? You bet. And somehow, it manages to weave all of these elements together without missing a beat.

Let’s start with the horror. We’re talking everything from classic ghost hunts to full-on battles with demons and angels. The scares are real, but _Supernatural_ never leans too hard into the gloom. Just when you’re clutching your blanket, Dean drops a snarky one-liner or Castiel gives you that wonderfully deadpan confusion, and suddenly you’re laughing. It’s this perfect pivot between tension and humor that keeps the show fresh and—dare I say it—fun.

But here’s where _Supernatural_ really nails it: the heart. Beneath all the monster slaying and apocalyptic drama, this is a show about family and sacrifice. Every episode, no matter how wild the plot gets, is anchored by Sam and Dean’s relationship. They’ll literally go to Hell (and back) for each other, and the emotional depth that brings is what turns a good show into a great one.

The genius of _Supernatural_ is that it never lets one genre overpower the others. It’s as comfortable delivering gut-punching emotional moments as it is making you jump out of your seat or burst out laughing. And that balance? That’s why fans keep coming back—because with _Supernatural_, you’re getting the best of every world.

**The Supernatural Mythology: From Urban Legends to Apocalyptic Battles**
If you thought _Supernatural_ was just about hunting ghosts and taking down demons, think again. This show goes all-in when it comes to mythology—pulling from urban legends, religious lore, and just about every spooky story you’ve ever heard whispered around a campfire. It’s like a folklore buffet, and _Supernatural_ serves it up hot.

The early seasons keep it tight with classic monster-of-the-week vibes: wendigos, shapeshifters, cursed mirrors—you name it, Sam and Dean have faced it. But here’s where the show really flexes its creative muscles. As it grows, so does the mythology, until we’re no longer just talking about salt lines and silver bullets. Suddenly, we’re dealing with fallen angels, biblical prophecies, and—oh yeah—Lucifer himself. This isn’t your average horror show; this is epic, universe-spanning storytelling.

_Supernatural_ does what few other shows manage—it constantly raises the stakes without collapsing under the weight of its own lore. It takes bold swings. One season, you’re dealing with a local haunting, the next, you’re questioning the very nature of free will and destiny as Sam and Dean go toe-to-toe with God. Yeah, it gets that big. But no matter how grand the mythology gets, the story never forgets where it started—on the road, in that Impala, with two brothers just trying to survive.

The genius lies in the balance. The show dances between grounded urban legends and sweeping, cosmic battles, and somehow, it all works. The lore isn’t just background noise either—it’s integral to the emotional weight of the series. Every demon exorcised, every angelic encounter adds layers to Sam and Dean’s journey, and by the end, you’re not just watching a TV show—you’re knee-deep in a modern myth.

**Character Growth and Evolution: From Hunters to Heroes**
Let’s get one thing straight—_Supernatural_ wouldn’t be the powerhouse it is without its incredible character work. Sure, the monsters, demons, and angels are fun, but it’s the characters that keep us coming back. Over 15 seasons, these aren’t just hunters—they’re heroes, villains, and everything in between, evolving in ways that make them feel real and raw.

We’ve got Sam and Dean, obviously, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. _Supernatural_ thrives because it fills its world with characters who are as complex as they are iconic, whether they’re wielding a blade, throwing a sarcastic quip, or breaking your heart in ways you didn’t see coming.

**The Winchester Brothers: Heart of the Show**
Let’s start where it all began: Sam and Dean. These two aren’t just brothers—they’re the emotional core of the entire series. From episode one, it’s clear their bond is what makes this show different. Sure, they fight demons and battle the apocalypse on a regular basis, but at the end of the day, Supernatural is a story about family.

Dean, the hardened, tough-love protector, grows from a cocky hunter into a deeply vulnerable character, grappling with self-worth and purpose. His bravado might be the surface, but underneath is a man who’d throw himself into Hell (literally) for the people he loves. Dean is a walking paradox: a man who craves love but feels he doesn’t deserve it. By the end, his arc feels like an emotional marathon—you’ve seen him win, lose, and keep fighting even when all hope is gone.

And then there’s Sam. The younger Winchester brother starts out wanting nothing to do with the hunter life, but as the series progresses, we watch him become the moral compass, even when that means making brutal sacrifices. He wrestles with dark powers, addiction, and self-doubt, but somehow, Sam always finds his way back to the fight. His journey from idealistic college kid to seasoned hero with a complicated past makes him one of the most dynamic characters on TV.

**Bobby Singer: The Reluctant Mentor Turned Father Figure**
Bobby Singer didn’t just help Sam and Dean fight monsters—he taught them how to survive in a world where evil was as constant as the rising sun. From the moment Bobby entered their lives, he wasn’t just another hunter in the background; he became the mentor they needed after losing their father. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural and his no-nonsense approach to hunting, Bobby became the man the brothers could turn to when things got rough, a guiding voice when John Winchester’s strict code of survival wasn’t enough.

What made Bobby stand out was that he wasn’t a stereotypical mentor. He was gruff, stubborn, and unapologetically real. But beneath that tough exterior, Bobby had a heart of gold—and a deep, almost paternal love for Sam and Dean. He didn’t just teach them how to fight; he taught them how to think. Bobby wasn’t afraid to call the boys out on their mistakes, pushing them to be better hunters, better brothers, and better men.

And let’s not forget his intellectual prowess. Bobby was the go-to source for lore, rituals, and all things supernatural. When Sam and Dean were stumped, Bobby had the answers, usually found buried in one of his many old, dusty books. His combination of intellect and heart made him indispensable to the Winchester’s journey.

More than anything, Bobby’s presence grounded Sam and Dean. He was their anchor, the one person who wasn’t afraid to show them tough love while also being the emotional support they so desperately needed. He wasn’t just a hunter or a friend—he was family, shaping the brothers into the heroes they would ultimately become.

**Castiel: The Angel Who Fell (In More Ways Than One)**
Now, let’s talk about _Castiel_, the angel who became so much more than just a celestial being. Castiel starts out as a soldier of Heaven, but his journey quickly takes him down a more human path. He learns about loyalty, sacrifice, and love—not from the angels above, but from Sam and Dean.

Castiel’s evolution is one of the most emotionally satisfying parts of the series. His deadpan humor and awkward attempts to understand human behavior give the show some of its best comedic moments, but it’s his growing humanity that really tugs at the heartstrings. He transforms from a rigid, obedient angel to a fiercely loyal friend, even when it means defying Heaven’s orders. By the end, Castiel isn’t just an angel—he’s family. His ultimate sacrifice, fueled by love, is one of the show’s most heartbreaking and powerful moments, cementing his place as a fan favorite.

**Crowley: The Demon with a Heart (Maybe)**
Now, enter _Crowley_, the self-proclaimed “King of Hell” who somehow becomes one of the most beloved characters in the show. Crowley isn’t your typical villain—he’s equal parts sinister and hilarious, wielding sarcasm like a weapon. He dances in the grey area between good and evil, forming uneasy alliances with Sam and Dean that blur the lines of morality. Crowley’s evolution is wild: from ruthless demon to someone who shows flashes of loyalty and, dare I say, compassion. He’s the bad guy you hate to love, but can’t stop rooting for. The man makes deals with souls, but still manages to feel like a necessary part of the Winchester family.

**Lucifer: The Devil in the Details**
And speaking of villains—let’s not forget _Lucifer_. You’d expect the Devil to be all fire and brimstone, but Supernatural gives us a version of him that’s sharp-tongued, manipulative, and, oddly enough, a little charismatic. He’s the ultimate Big Bad, but Lucifer’s complexity goes deeper than just being evil incarnate. He’s a character who feels betrayed, cast aside by his own father (God), and, as twisted as it sounds, you almost get him. Almost. Lucifer is unpredictable in the best way—one minute, he’s terrifying, and the next, he’s delivering one of the funniest lines in the show. That’s the beauty of _Supernatural_—even the most sinister characters have layers.

**Rowena: Witch with Ambition**
Let’s talk about _Rowena_. If you thought Crowley was complicated, his mother takes it to another level. Rowena starts out as a cunning, ruthless witch who’s only out for herself. But over time, she evolves into something much more intriguing—a fiercely independent character who eventually shows depth beyond her manipulative facade. Rowena’s growth from power-hungry villain to someone capable of sacrifice gives us one of the richest character arcs in the series. Plus, her sharp tongue and witty one-liners make every scene she’s in a delight. Rowena is the kind of character who proves that even the baddest of witches can change—if only on her own terms.

**Charlie Bradbury: The Nerdy Hero We Needed**
_Charlie Bradbury_ was the fandom’s heart, the geek girl who jumped into the Winchester world and held her own. A brilliant hacker turned hunter, she brought an infectious energy to the series. Charlie was quirky, brave, and endlessly resourceful. Her relationship with Sam and Dean evolved into something like family—proving that not all bonds in _Supernatural_ are forged in blood. Charlie represented the fan in all of us, geeking out over LARPing one minute and slaying monsters the next. Her tragic end hit hard because we saw so much of ourselves in her—a reminder that in Supernatural, no one is safe, not even the ones who make us smile the most.

_Supernatural’s_ genius lies in its characters—each one layered, each one evolving in unexpected ways. Whether it’s Dean battling inner demons, Sam wrestling with impossible choices, or Crowley and Rowena walking the tightrope between villain and ally, every character brings something vital to the table. It’s the humanity behind these larger-than-life figures that makes _Supernatural_ more than just a show about monsters—it’s a show about people, family, and the impossible lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.

**The Classic Rock Soundtrack and Baby: The Heart and Soul of Supernatural**
Let’s get one thing straight—_Supernatural_ wouldn’t be _Supernatural_ without its killer classic rock soundtrack and the Impala, better known as “Baby.” These aren’t just fun add-ons; they’re core characters in the show’s DNA. Dean’s love for classic rock and his dedication to Baby go beyond fandom quirks—they’re extensions of who he is, and by extension, what the show is all about.

First, the music. You hear the opening chords of Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” and suddenly, you’re not just watching a show—you’re stepping into an epic, fifteen-season journey. It’s the unofficial anthem of the Winchesters, and it hits with emotional weight every time it plays. But it doesn’t stop there. Supernatural treats classic rock like a gospel, with Dean as its faithful preacher. Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bob Seger—it’s all there. Whether it’s “Back in Black” roaring through an Impala montage or the bittersweet notes of Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” during one of those rare reflective moments, the music has always been the show’s soul.

And let’s not forget “Night Moves.” When Dean and Sam share a rare, carefree moment belting out Bob Seger’s iconic track in the car, it’s not just two brothers passing time—it’s a reminder that even in the middle of hunting monsters and fighting the apocalypse, they’re still human. They still feel. These songs aren’t just background noise—they’re emotional markers that tell the story as much as the dialogue does.

This soundtrack does more than fill silence—it gives the show its heartbeat. Dean rolling down the highway to “Back in Black” feels like a declaration. This isn’t just a random playlist; it’s a soundtrack with soul. And for the fans who grew up with these songs, it’s a nostalgic goldmine, bringing together the thrill of adventure and the comfort of familiarity in every riff and guitar solo. Whether it’s Rush’s “Working Man” pounding through an action-packed scene or “Renegade” by Styx building up to one of the show’s more tense moments, the music elevates the storytelling every single time.

Now, let’s talk about _Baby_—the other constant in Sam and Dean’s lives. This 1967 Chevy Impala isn’t just a car; she’s a Winchester in her own right. Baby is as much a part of the show as any character. She’s been through every monster hunt, every road trip, and every heartbreak. Dean’s love for her is more than just the pride of owning a classic car—Baby is home. She’s where the brothers retreat when the world gets too heavy, where they talk out their next move or sit in quiet, reflective moments while the radio hums with classic rock.

And then there’s the legendary episode “Baby,” where we get an entire story told from her perspective. It’s genius because it shows us what we’ve always known—Baby isn’t just a backdrop, she’s _central_ to the Winchesters’ lives. Every dent, scratch, and repair tells a story. She’s carried them through battles with demons, angels, and even Death itself, and yet, no matter how bad things get, Baby keeps on rolling.

The best moments in _Supernatural_ often come when the Impala tears down the road, music blaring, and you realize it’s more than just a scene—it’s the embodiment of freedom. When Bob Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” plays during quieter moments, it adds depth to the boys’ story. These aren’t just two guys saving the world—they’re two guys who’ve lost, who’ve sacrificed, and who still get back in that car and keep driving.

And let’s not forget how integral these two elements—music and Baby—are to the fans. Every time we hear “Carry On Wayward Son” or see the Impala glide through a night-lit highway, it brings us back to the heart of _Supernatural_: family, loyalty, and the idea that no matter how bad things get, you don’t stop fighting. The music and Baby are reminders that the Winchesters always keep moving forward. The music gives the show its pulse, and Baby? She gives it its heart.

Together, Baby and the soundtrack represent more than just cool cars and great music—they symbolize the unbreakable bond between the brothers and the freedom of life on the road. Dean’s devotion to Baby is about more than metal and wheels—it’s about roots, history, and the one constant in a life filled with chaos. And the classic rock soundtrack? It’s the spirit of _Supernatural_, carrying us through every battle, every tear, and every victory.

So yeah, Baby might just be a car and the music might just be a bunch of rock tracks, but in _Supernatural_, they’re everything. Together, they make the Winchesters’ journey more than just a fight against evil—they make it a road trip you never want to end.

**The Balance Between Monster-of-the-Week, Epic Mythology, and Meta Episodes**
If _Supernatural_ had stuck to just one formula, it wouldn’t have lasted 15 seasons. What makes this show work so brilliantly is its ability to walk the line between gripping standalone episodes (the infamous “monster-of-the-week” format), sprawling multi-season myth arcs, and bold, fourth-wall-breaking meta episodes that drag you deeper into the _Supernatural_ universe with a wink and a smirk. This is a balancing act most shows can’t pull off—but _Supernatural_ makes it look effortless.

The monster-of-the-week episodes are where the show leans into its roots. These are the stories that feel like urban legends brought to life: Wendigos, shapeshifters, Bloody Mary—all the creatures you grew up fearing—_Supernatural_ served them up with eerie intensity. These episodes kept the show grounded, reminding us that no matter how high the stakes got, at its heart, it was about two brothers solving mysteries in the dark.

But then, _Supernatural_ did something even smarter—it built a mythos that stretched far beyond the usual ghost story. As the series unfolded, it cracked open a bigger mythology, introducing demons, angels, Lucifer, and eventually, God Himself. And it wasn’t just expanding the stakes—it was creating an entire universe. That seamless switch from local hauntings to biblical showdowns is what gives the series its epic scale. The transition from “what’s that creepy thing in the dark?” to “oh, we’re fighting the actual apocalypse now” shouldn’t have worked this well. But somehow, it did.

Then came the secret weapon: _Supernatural’s_ ability to laugh at itself. The show broke the fourth wall like no other, delivering meta episodes that poked fun at its own genre, fandom, and even its actors. These episodes weren’t just gimmicks—they were masterclasses in self-awareness, using humor to not only keep the audience entertained but also to highlight the show’s versatility. Episodes like “The French Mistake,” where Sam and Dean are tossed into an alternate universe where they’re actors in a TV show called _Supernatural_, are the perfect blend of absurdity and cleverness. You’ve got the Winchesters trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki poke fun at their real lives. It’s a ridiculous concept, but it works—and it’s just one example of how the show seamlessly merged its deep, emotional storytelling with moments of pure comedic genius.

But it didn’t stop there. Whether it was “Changing Channels,” which hilariously transported Sam and Dean through various TV show genres (hello, sitcom laugh track), or “Fan Fiction,” which took meta to a whole new level by turning the spotlight on the _Supernatural_ fandom, these episodes dared to break the rules of traditional TV. And yet, even while poking fun at itself, the show never lost sight of its core themes: family, destiny, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.

These meta episodes gave the show room to breathe between the high-stakes mythology arcs and the creature-hunting adventures, allowing for moments of levity and creativity that kept fans hooked. One week, you’re watching Sam and Dean battle a vengeful spirit, and the next, they’re trapped in a fake version of their own lives or hilariously battling their way through TV parodies. And the best part? It never felt out of place. _Supernatural_ had built such a flexible, layered world that even the most outlandish episodes fit into its broader narrative.

The show’s humor and willingness to poke fun at its own genre only strengthened its bond with fans. We weren’t just watching two brothers take on the apocalypse; we were in on the joke, laughing along as the writers playfully deconstructed the show’s own tropes. The fourth-wall-breaking episodes added a new dimension to the series, proving that _Supernatural_ wasn’t afraid to take risks, mock itself, or fully embrace the weird.

Whether you’re watching an emotional myth arc about Heaven and Hell, a spooky creature-of-the-week, or a meta episode that leaves you laughing out loud, _Supernatural_ mastered the art of keeping its audience on their toes. One moment you’re on the edge of your seat, the next you’re in stitches—but no matter what, you’re invested. That’s the magic of this show: the perfect balance of humor, horror, and heart.

**Family and Sacrifice: The Heartbeat of Supernatural**
“Saving people, hunting things—the family business.” It’s more than a catchphrase. For the Winchesters, it’s a creed. Right from the first episode, _Supernatural_ drives home the fact that the Winchester family isn’t like most others. They don’t sit down for Sunday dinners or swap happy holiday stories. Their legacy is blood-soaked, hard-earned, and filled with impossible choices. For Sam and Dean, family isn’t just about genetics—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and the willingness to walk into hell (sometimes literally) to save the people you love.

But _Supernatural_ doesn’t stop at biological bonds. While the show’s emotional center is Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection, it constantly reminds us that family is about more than blood. From Bobby Singer to Castiel, Charlie Bradbury to Jodie Mills, the Winchesters build a found family around them, one forged in battle and trust.

Bobby isn’t just the grizzled hunter who helps from the sidelines. He’s the father figure the brothers desperately needed after losing their own. And when Bobby sacrifices everything to protect Sam and Dean, it’s not out of duty—it’s love. His gruff “idjits” is always laced with affection, making his inevitable departure one of the series’ most heartbreaking moments. For Bobby, family meant being willing to give everything, even when there was nothing left to give.

Then there’s Castiel. The angel who started off as Heaven’s loyal soldier quickly became something far more complex—a brother in arms, a friend, and ultimately, family. Castiel’s arc is one of the most poignant examples of _Supernatural’s_ exploration of loyalty. His decision to fall from grace, to fight alongside the Winchesters instead of against them, represents the power of chosen family. Castiel’s ultimate sacrifice for Dean—driven by love, not duty—solidifies his place as a Winchester, proving that sometimes, the strongest family ties aren’t the ones we’re born with, but the ones we create.

And who could forget the fierce women of _Supernatural_? Charlie Bradbury might not have been born into the hunter life, but she earned her place through loyalty and guts. As a geeky, fearless hacker turned badass hunter, Charlie shows us that family can be chosen. Her bond with the Winchesters ran deep, and her tragic end still stings because she wasn’t just a friend—she was family. Jodie Mills, on the other hand, stepped into the role of protector, becoming a mother figure to a new generation of hunters. She didn’t have to take these lost girls under her wing, but she did because, in _Supernatural_, family is about showing up when no one else will.

Time and time again, _Supernatural_ shows us that family means sacrifice. The Winchesters ask themselves the hard question: how far would you go for the people you love? And the answer is always: further than you think. Whether it’s Dean making deals with demons to save Sam, or Sam risking his life to pull Dean from the brink, their story is one of selflessness—sometimes to a fault.

And that’s where the real beauty of the show lies. It’s not just about hunting monsters or saving the world. It’s about the people you’re willing to stand beside in the fight. It’s about the love, loyalty, and sacrifice that define the Winchester legacy. Because in _Supernatural_, family isn’t just a bond—it’s a battle. And even when the stakes are cosmic, it always comes down to saving people and hunting things, because that’s the family business.

**The Fandom That Kept It Alive: The Power of the SPN Family**
When we talk about _Supernatural_ unprecedented 15-season run, there’s one undeniable force that carried the show through every twist, turn, and apocalyptic showdown: the SPN Family. It’s more than just a fanbase—this community of devoted viewers, creators, and passionate advocates became the backbone of _Supernatural_, driving its success and influencing the way fandoms interact with television today. From launching fan campaigns to attending conventions, the SPN Family didn’t just support the show—they helped shape it.

What makes _Supernatural_ unique is how it built this loyal, worldwide following, despite starting off as an under-the-radar series on The WB (remember that network?). Back in 2005, _Supernatural_ premiered to modest ratings, with no guarantee it would survive past its first season. The show might have flown under the radar of the mainstream critics, but the fans? They saw something special.

It wasn’t long before the SPN Family transformed into a cultural powerhouse, keeping _Supernatural_ alive through low ratings, network shifts, and even a writer’s strike. While some shows rely solely on their storylines or cast to stay afloat, _Supernatural_ had something extra: a fanbase that wasn’t afraid to fight for it. These weren’t casual viewers tuning in once a week—they were engaged, connected, and fiercely loyal.

Fan conventions were one of the biggest drivers behind this loyalty. Year after year, conventions like Creation Entertainment’s Salute to Supernatural became pilgrimage spots for fans to meet their favorite cast members, share their art, theories, and stories, and celebrate their love for the show. For many, these events were more than just photo-ops or autograph sessions—they were community-building hubs. Here, fans bonded over their shared love of all things Winchester, forming friendships and creating memories that transcended the screen.
But what truly sets the SPN Family apart is its activism. The fans didn’t just watch and engage—they gave back. From charity drives inspired by the cast to campaigns like Random Acts (founded by Misha Collins, the actor behind Castiel), the SPN Family showed that they were willing to take their love for the show and channel it into positive real-world change. It’s this deeper level of engagement that sets them apart from your average fandom.

And here’s the thing—the _Supernatural_ team knew how much the fandom mattered. They weren’t just passive observers—they embraced the SPN Family, making them a part of the narrative. Episodes like “Fan Fiction” and “The Monster at the End of This Book” celebrated the fans in a way no other series had done before, blending real-life fandom with the fictional world of the Winchesters. In the meta episodes, the show didn’t just break the fourth wall—it leaned into it, acknowledging fan fiction, fan theories, and even shipping (Dean/Cas, anyone?) with a wink and a nod.

More than once, the SPN Family made the impossible happen. After all, it was fan dedication that helped push _Supernatural_ into its 15th season, a feat almost unheard of in genre television. And when the show finally aired its last episode, the fandom didn’t just disappear. The community, built over 15 years of love, continues to thrive through fan projects, conventions, and online spaces dedicated to keeping the _Supernatural_ spirit alive.

In an age where shows often live and die by network decisions or fluctuating ratings, _Supernatural_ proved that the voice of the fans could be louder than any number crunching in a studio boardroom. The SPN Family wasn’t just a group of people who liked a show—they were the fuel that kept the engine running, year after year, apocalypse after apocalypse.

So, while the Winchesters may have closed the final chapter of their story, the SPN Family ensures that the legacy of _Supernatural_ lives on. It’s a testament to the power of community, proving that when fans truly care, they can keep a story alive well beyond its final credits.

**The Legacy of Supernatural**
When the curtains finally closed on _Supernatural_ after a monumental 15-season run, it was clear the show had left behind more than just a string of successful episodes. It had built a universe, a community, and a legacy that reshaped how genre TV could be experienced. What started as a story about two brothers hunting monsters morphed into a saga that dived deep into mythology, human emotion, and, most importantly, the concept of family—both by blood and by choice.

The show’s impact isn’t just measured by its episode count or ratings—it’s about the lives it touched. For many fans, _Supernatural_ became more than just a weekly watch; it was a constant through the ups and downs of their lives. The show’s exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what’s right, even when it’s hard, resonated deeply. It gave viewers more than just entertainment—it offered comfort and a sense of belonging.

And let’s not forget the way _Supernatural_ evolved the landscape of TV storytelling. It mixed procedural elements with an ongoing mythology in a way that allowed it to flex between epic apocalyptic plots and intimate character-driven moments. It embraced a _meta_ sense of humor that blurred the line between fiction and reality, giving fans episodes that felt like inside jokes shared by a family—fitting for a show that always came back to the theme of familial bonds.

As for the cast, they weren’t just characters on a screen. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and the rest became household names, in no small part due to the accessibility and warmth they showed to their fans. It’s rare for a cast to engage so fully with their audience, and that, perhaps, is _Supernatural’s_ real magic. The sense of community fostered between the creators, cast, and audience is something most shows can only dream of achieving. It’s why, even after the final episode aired, the SPN Family continues to thrive.

At its core, Supernatural was about more than just hunting monsters or saving the world. It was about connection—the connection between characters, the connection between the show and its audience, and the connections it fostered between fans around the globe. For 15 years, Supernatural wasn’t just a show; it was a phenomenon. And in that time, it proved one truth above all else: that family doesn’t end in blood.","Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Misha Collins","* * 15 years save people , hunt things : supernatural

121,Ncis,"Crime, Drama, Action & Adventure",7.6,"Written to depress young men.
It seems that Bellisario writes mostly the same depressing  and predictable story each time. Everything is contrived to kill women with dark hair and dark eyes. I don't know if he was jilted by too many brunettes as a kid, or if he's just into worship of Hitler and the Nazi ideology.
Either way, it makes for a depressing show for any young man. I watched about five of these shows, and it was always the same. He bent over backwards for the Nazi ideology, for whatever reason.
I can't remember all the Magnum episodes, but it seems that was pretty much the main weakness of the Magnum PI shows, too. 
There's really no detective work to note, because he bangs us over the head with this ideology so much that you can't notice anything else. He just simply won't let you notice anything else. He's eaten up with it.

I don't know what to make of it or even, how to adequately, define it. I suspect that's the idea. It walks a blurred line between religion/superstition and atheism/rationalism. 

At first, I found it a rather dissonance inducing experience but as I became accustomed to its quirks, of which there are many, I found I rather liked it. 

As a long standing rationalist, its religiosity amused me but, thankfully, the manner in which it is presented, is not lecturing or heavy handed. Rather, you get opposing views and perspectives, on the often strange world, in which we live.

The Simpsons once mocked and then it became mainstream pop culture. So that is a cause of why it has declined.

And another cause is that there is a new PC comedy trend to laugh at things. As in the audience is expected to laugh at the object itself without having an actual joke behind it. As in, ""This is a computer, Laugh at it!""

Because of that we see a transformation of the jokes. The celebrity guests were once the butt of the joke. Mulder and Scully came on and the Simpsons mocked them. Now the joke is the celebrity guest. As in, ""This is Lady Gaga,"" or ""this is Michelle Obama.""

They aren't spoofed or satirized in any way, the audience is just asked to laugh at the fact that they have a celebrity guest.

And the final reason is the laugh track comedy, in which the Simpsons has none. That is no laugh track. But now the writing sets up the jokes with almost a pause for laughter as if the tracks were there.

In the past the jokes were piled onto one another. There would be several jokes stacked right next to one another in a single event. Now it has become joke, pause to acknowledge the joke, continue.

Kameyama,"" kicked out of his precinct to ""Special Missions,"" a two-man office. Anglophile Sugishita served his rough-around-the-edges partner English tea and described ""Special Missions"" as a dumping ground for MPD misfits. 

They had no duties and no cases to investigate, which had led other junior Police officers to quit the MPD, as expected. However, Sugishita was in the habit of peeking into Cold and Inactive cases via the head of Forensics, ""Yonezawa Mamoru.""

Sugishita went on to say that it was ""his bad habit"" to scrutinize the details of such cases instead of ""doing nothing."" In time, the ""odd Police couple"" begin to investigate stalled cases, dragging Section Two detectives, ""Itami,"" Miura,"" and ""Serizawa,"" kicking and screaming, to cases they take credit for solving.

**SEASON 02:**

When I watched the first season when it was originally aired, it had some serious fan following, but I won't say it was very very famous at the time. Now, after the second season, seems everything has changed. Drastically the votings, rating, reviews have increased. IF one more season with similarly powerful characters, story comes out, then it surely would be among the greatest like 'Dexter', 'Breaking Bad' et cetera. I am confident it will go up to the seventh to set up a perfect finale in the next half decade.

I did not review the first season, because I was not sure it would get better in the following season. I thought it was a one season thing. Now I'm here with awesome progression in the second season. I loved every episode. I've rated a few of them are out of out as they are well deserved. Firstly, for this to get better was the characters. A couple of new ones added. Not some sidekicks, but yes, they were with a stronger hold in the main narration.

I loved Charlotte, the Lucifer's mother. That's the best thing happened here. Particularly the casting for it was the best pick. Tricia Helfer was like never seen before hot. The way the season ended was sad, if you had loved her. I hope she returns none other than as Charlotte in the future. Aimee Garcia was another highlitable cast. Her inclusion makes the crime fighting more interesting. She's a mini Dexter, without the dark desires.

Each episode was unique, but the overall story flow was excellent, unlike the previous season where each episode has one crime to solve. Here too with the same style, but some time extended further for the next part. There was an aim for story to head, but the way it was presented was good. Shared it all throughout the season, while each episode had its own agenda. Lots of humours, as well as actions, adventures, suspense and a bit romantic.

So, if you haven't started, it's time to do so, because as I said it will be one of the best television programme on making that you should not miss while you have chance to follow from the beginning itself. All the actors were great, a well written and shot series. The season's finale and its final scene created more curiosity in me going to the third. I'm hoping for another magnificent season, which is due in a couple of months at the end of the year (2017). Highly recommended!

228,Lucifer,"Crime, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.5,"This show started in 2016 and has six seasons, ending(?) 2021.  It turned to trash around the end of the 2nd or 3rd seasons.  
The storytelling for the show or premise was a mortal female cop having to work with the Devil to solve crimes.  The Devil is on earth because he became fed up with his role as Hell's Ruler.  And the writers did very well with the Lucifer character.  Many aspects to the Devil being supernatural came through wonderfully for the audience, one profound trait being _Lucifer_ (**Tom Ellis**) refusing, or being under an angel geas, to be unable to speak a lie; so he goes around telling people the truth about who he is.  Not fighting this, or speaking around the truth makes the facet a very comically astute trait to the character for the show.  The way other mortal characters react to the news which is either to dismiss the claim outright or gloss over it as ramblings completes the humor; especially when they realize the truth through some supernatural display from the Devil himself.  And ofcourse the female detective, _Chloe Decker_ (**Lauren German**) also does not believe him, her job being based solely in proof and fact--evidence.  While there are numerous instances producing evidence to Lucifer's claim on who is, the detective still (ofcourse) can't believe it.  That is until Lucifer insist on proving it to Chloe directly.  To both their surprise, he finds out he can be injured when she is within close proximity to the Prince of Hell. 

The show did very well, even if one could foresee where hetero partnerships in tv shows eventually go.  That is foregone.  It's how the show gets the audience there which determines if there will be a following season.  And I will admit, I did not like the show.  I felt it to be a bit contrived, BUT worth giving a chance.  I, personally, thought the devil could be a bit more of a bad-ass; instead of just what the guy appeared to be, a cocktail party pianoist.  
Other aspects of Lucifer's divinity were introduced such as soul-deals being made, other angels, and eventually demons.  The first introduction to Lucifer's astranged family was _Amenidiel_ (**D.B. Woodside**), brother, self-proclaimed greatest warrior of heaven's Silver City, and the right-hand hatchet man for God.  My first ""dark cloud"" of foreboding on the show peeked through when I heard Amenidiel address the Devil with the nick-name: (...jeez) ""Luci.""  Pronounced ""Lucy.""  But I (with effort) dismissed it.  I told myself ""GIVE it a chance.""  I did, and the show did not fail to deliver entertainment.  
Ellis and German's characters have good chemistry in front of the camera, and the plethora of well-known TV stars featured in the episodes, kept everyones' attention and pleased to look forward to the next show.  Other characters to become regulars co-stars include Lucifer's right-hand, the head Executioner of Hell (...sighs) Maze. _Maze_ is played by **Lesley-Ann Brandt** from cable tv's hit NC-17 rated show, _Spartacus_.  Maze's character is easily summed up (in a good way) as kung-fu Biker Bitch with knives and a penchant for extreme BDSM when in a good mood.  When she is in a bad mood she fills the role of Amenidiel's mirror opposite for the Devil.  The two are not on the same power level, with Amenidiel being the top warrior angel, but when earthbound, Maze has the upper hand in dealing with and understanding humans.  
There is _Dan Espenoza_ (**Kevin Alejandro** -- whose credited filmography is very strong in TVseries) as Chloe's ex-crooked detective husband, and their daughter _Trixie Espenoza_ (**Scarlett Estavez**).  Also introduced is Lucifer's psychiatrist, _Dr. Linda Martin_ (**Rachel Harris**), whom which Lucifer constantly misinturpret's her advice she futiley tries to guide him with.  Lastly was the (I think) sudden appearence of character _Ella Lopez_ (**Aimee Garcia**).  The plucky and ""loveable"" forensic specialist.  All these characters make up a pretty good cast and the writers did the show and characters justice.  The show looked promising, until...[que sound bite] >DUNT, DUNT, DUUUUUUUUUUHHHH!!!!!<  The third season began.

**WARNING:** This review gets more personable from here, meaning if you like the show, the following will come off as a bunch of whining & complaining.  If you feel take-it-or-leave-it about the show then there will be some ""Oh yeah"" moments.  If the show had you at a point to where you throw your hands up like a BlackJack dealer leaving the table, then I appreciate the high-fives.  

When the show goes down hill...My most glaring complaint was Amenidiel getting Dr. Linda Martin pregnant.  I mean, c'MON!!!  Woodside is 52 and I would have thought this guy was going _into his 40s_ ; not leaving.  Harris is 54.  And she looks _every bit_ of closing her late fifties!!  When I first saw the woman as the shrink I thought, ""She is too old to be wearing her hair that long.""  And it was a sad attempt, just like later with Lucifer's ""mother"" being introduced, at making a woman not look her age.  When it is sooooo apparent she is the oldest person on the cast.  But this season happened when Liberal-Left thinkers were in full speed ahead and forcing ideals of interracial dating, virtue-signaling, inclusivity of the ""alphabet people"" into the viewing audience's faces as if Gay Judgement Day were at hand.  And along with Dr. Martin's geriatric defience of science (bars) came Maze's sudden ability to kiss women.  It wasn't a big stretch seeing as demons are not known for having a concept of shame, propriety, or morals but the clam-to-clam thing is NOT as endearing as the writers may think.  Girl-on-Girl stuff is exciting IN adult movies and R-rated movies; typically where nudity is involved.  Seen in any other muted venue, and...it's just...ew.  
Next complaint was the shoe-horning in of the forensic specialist, Ella Lopez.  I say it that way because the show goes through an _entire_ season before this character is introduced.  And when she does hit the scene, Garcia's makes her character come across as too personally familiar with the main characters to the point of being overbearing.  It's...off-putting to say the least.  It's like literally _no one_ knows who this chick is, and since she is coming in on the SECOND season after all the other characters are established in the first season,  the vibe leaves the viewer thinking, ""Jeez, this chick is severely un-professional, and a borderline sociopath.  No one (in the viewership) knows you 'Ella!'  You have no previous interactions with the main characters!!  Why are you acting like the three of you had beers two nights earlier??""  She is a stranger to the audience and the main characters, BUT she's the forensic specialist and now they _have_ to talk to her whether the audience likes her or not.  So, there's that.   
The third and fourth seasons are not bad if you can exclude the ever growing Liberal agenda being shoved into everyone's faces.  Charlie, Amenidiel's son gets kidnapped because demons come looking for a new ruler of Hell.  Lucifer's mother is trying to fit in with humans, and gets involved with Dan.  Lopez is having existential crisis because she dated a psycho.  And Lucifer after getting his mother to begin her own plain of existence, returns to Hell as it's ruler.  

> **The third and fourth seasons moved along, but then the fourth season had to end with God becoming _senile!?_  Loosing his powers..!?  Then _joining_ his wife in her reality to be essentially a stay-at-home dad!?!  As Bill Cosby would say, ""What in the filth-flarn-filth is going on with this show!?!""  Yeah.  I didn't have high hopes for the following season.  And I was right.**

The fifth season has Lucifer as a bumbling idiot, blamed for being an absentee father by a daughter (**Briana Hildebrand** -- Negasonic Teenage Warhead--[though a lot chunkier now], _Deadpool_), he never knew about, from the future.  She claims he disappeared before she was born; abandoning a pregnant Decker.  And let's just cast aside all that lore about the apocalypse should Lucifer ever beget a woman with child.  No, let's look past Lucifer making a fool of himself trying to assuage this young lady's misplaced anger over something he apparently had no choice or control.  Let's forget he lied to her in the second episode, something he is not supposed to be able to do, about him knowing she was his.  Hey, she's angry, gay--because ofcourse, her father wasn't around--, and something of an ungrateful bitch; so that means she can act out however she wants. >eyeroll<  Maze and Eve are getting married >eghk< when suddenly Eve's ex-husband, Adam, shows up. 
 And unlike her, he's whiter than Johnny Appleseed & Wonderbread put together.  I thought this was supposed to inclusive & diverse...??  The one thing I can say about Woke-Hollywood nowadays, is that if a white guy is on the scene you can gar-rown-tee he's a bad guy.  Don't believe me, just ask Cain (season 3).   You'd think Woke-Hollywood would be able to stick to their marshmellow guns and find a well-tanned good looking Hispanic or Hindu to play Adam.  But noooooo.  It's not a show if you don't reveal how evil the white man can be.

228,Lucifer,"Crime, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.5,"Lucifer"" is a woeful excuse for a television series, a devilish descent into the depths of mediocrity that leaves its audience longing for salvation from its torturous plot and laughable attempts at wit.

At its core, ""Lucifer"" revolves around the most overused and unoriginal concept imaginable: the Devil himself forsaking his infernal throne to play detective in Los Angeles. It's a premise that would make even the most dedicated connoisseur of the supernatural cringe in embarrassment. Instead of offering a fresh take on the age-old battle between good and evil, the show falls flat with its trite, uninspired narrative.

The acting in ""Lucifer"" is nothing short of painful. Tom Ellis's portrayal of Lucifer Morningstar is more irritating than charismatic, leaving viewers yearning for a more captivating devil to grace the screen. The supporting cast fares no better, with performances that range from wooden to outright cringe-worthy. The attempts at humour are so forced and awkward that they often elicit groans instead of laughs.

The show's writing is equally abysmal. The dialogue is filled with clunky one-liners and contrived attempts at clever wordplay that would make even the most hackneyed stand-up comedian wince. The attempts at exploring moral and ethical dilemmas are shallow at best, reducing complex issues to simplistic and predictable resolutions.

One of the most egregious offenses of ""Lucifer"" is its blatant misuse of religious and mythological elements. The show's portrayal of celestial and infernal realms is nothing short of sacrilegious, reducing profound religious themes to nothing more than a backdrop for mediocre crime-solving escapades. It's disrespectful to both religious believers and those who appreciate thoughtful storytelling.

The special effects and production values are subpar, to say the least. The supernatural elements, including Lucifer's wings and powers, are rendered with all the finesse of a low-budget B-movie. The show's depiction of hell is equally underwhelming, lacking the grandeur or terror that one would expect.

In summary, ""Lucifer"" is a satanic series in the worst sense of the word—a soulless, uninspired, and downright painful viewing experience. It takes a potentially intriguing premise and squanders it on a poorly executed, cringe-inducing mess of a show. If you value your time and sanity, steer clear of this devilish disaster of a series.","Tom Ellis, Lauren German, Kevin Alejandro, D.B.

245,Dexter: Original Sin,"Crime, Drama",8.5,"Simply put, not good. 

The unimaginative and rather cheesily titled ""Dexter Original Sin"" is, unlike the original series, about as subtle as a meat clever. 

The sense of light, sophisticated handling associated with the original series, is largely absent.Instead, the treatment is over the top, at times bordering on the ridiculous. We see Dexter looking at a girly mag but no he's really fawning over news cuttings of serial killer Ted Bundy wedged between its pristine pages. Oh and his sister ends up passed out drunk at a party about to be raped but after Dexter intercedes to save her, she can still apparently ""take care of herself"". Clearly, as we have just seen, that's not true. 

Its this kind of low brow, unintelligent nonsense, with a dash of woke BS, that sinks this series to the bottom. As is so often the case too, its a shame, as its a decent cast who have come together for this bloody debacle.

In summary, all the trappings of success can't make up for the absence of a well crafted, intelligent, believable story.

251,From,"Mystery, Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.2,"As a fan of “Lost,” I was intrigued when I heard that some of the same people were involved in the new EPIX series “From.” Unfortunately, the show doesn’t live up to the expectations set by “Lost.” While it starts off incredibly promising and has a unique feel, the lazy writing and subpar acting hold it back as the season progresses.

The unforgiving gore and genuine horror element that the show first offers are among its most distinctive features, but even these begin to wear thin as the season progresses. By the time I finished the first season, I couldn’t help but feel underwhelmed.

Although a second season is in the works, “From” barely does enough to keep me returning for more. I would probably tell my past self not to watch it if I could go back in time.

Even though I’m drawn in by the mystery, I’m worried about the show’s future. The writing is reminiscent of J.J. Abrams; the writers are adding mysteries at whim with no idea how to resolve them. Intriguing at first, but the poor writing soon began to sour the experience.

If you enjoy mysteries, you might want to give “From” a shot, but be aware that it features subpar acting and a superfluous plot that will make you lament the wasted opportunities. It’s far from bad, but it’s also not particularly noteworthy given the calibre of television we’ve been spoilt by in 2022.

Knowing some of the same people involved with LOST were working on this is what got me to watch it. First season there were definitely more questions than answers but that's not a bad thing. It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next and how the heck at they going to get out.

I think the current 3rd seasons has really upped the game with a story line on the 'outside' and inside which gets you thinking how it's all connected. Season 3 also seems to take some pretty big steps in answering some questions we've had in the back of our minds for the first 2 seasons. I hope they learned their lesson from LOST and don't let it drag on like that and wrap up the story in 5 seasons, 6 max.

Capitalism is omnipresent, profit and money are in everyone's mind.
Of course the 'Sups' abuse their power for their own interests and many more cruel and immoral things.
Every hero's doing is explained, some more, some less. There's a perfect balance between big serious storylines and little kind of darker humor ones. 

'The Boys' are trying to destroy this whole system due to personal problems with some of the 'Sups'. The focus clearly is around them and what they're doing. 
So it's definitely an Anti-Superhero show which look and topic reminds me of 'Watchmen' or some other more Noir candidates in this genre.

256,The Boys,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Action & Adventure",8.463,"For me the whole series is a total and effective satire that lets us see what would become of the world if fiction becomes reality: heroes lose interest in saving the world (or take advantage of its status), are forced to do things that are not right, to follow the company's own interests and do not go out to end the crime if they are not followed by a camera that captures each of their movements, even though they are always transmitting that image of exemplary citizen when in fact they are greedy and treat their fans badly.

It's also chilling to know that people in power act as judges and executioners to decide what crimes are profitable and what millions of dollars they rent their superheroes to other cities so they can be safe. The precision in the denunciation of The Boys is one of its strongest points since satire towards these characters is not new, but combining it with the theme of corporate America and wild capitalism gives it a clear differential touch.

Gore and sex are always fun, but in this case the series tries so hard and goes so overboard that anyone who dares to watch the series through might as well have a barf bag on hand.

Yes, to question the established narrative is to  be a rube, a fool, a bumpkin, a nobody, who waves a flag and blows an air horn.

Of course, ironically the mainstream, especially the mainstream media, have never been more doubted. Small wonder they have taken to dosing peoples entertainment in a clumsily transparent attempt, to lure the ""sheep' back into the pen. 

Suffice to say, lots of wasted potential here. Decent acting, some excellent idea's, all buried beneath thick cheesy layers of mainstream conformism. Ironically, the complete antithesis of the so called reactionary individualism, allegedly inherent, in the series key characters.

In summary, when ersatz counter culture is a counter for legitimate counter culture. This series started out well but now its subverting nothing. Its just another pitch, for mainstream woke conformism. The fact they need to sell ""this hard"", for me at least, offers a degree of insight into how many people are actually buying in....","Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, Jessie T.

274,Steven Universe,"Animation, Comedy, Action & Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.4,"The PPG reboot opened up my frustration over the current state of Cartoon Network Studios, and overtime my enjoyment of We Bare Bears and Steven Universe has sunk not just because of spoilers, but because they represent the state of their production studio in this age - diverse in every aspect but style. Ever since hipster 20-somethings with a passion for memes and existentialism took control, I felt like the only one who could feel his childhood slowly starting to melt, and not realise it until one of these shows got spoiled more than possibly any show that’s ever buzzed in front of me.

Steven would be a perfectly good watch if it was placed alongside livelier, more timeless shows that didn’t have any subject matter that would fly over childrens’ heads but could entertain adults in equal measures, but it represents the best and worst of present-day Cartoon Network; characters with defined personalities, strong she-leads, smart writing and complex, human storytelling, but also humour that sees its web popularity as no coincidence, melodrama prominent to the point of becoming forced, more reliance on internet culture than any other network and diversity so broad that it becomes a tad overbearing. I’m all for progressiveness, but the problem is that these so-called cartoons are designed, written and created by the average Tumblr/Twitter user, these being the (un)safe havens for Japan-inspired nerds and crazy social justice warriors. This is exactly why I had doubts about the Powerpuffs being rebooted from the moment they announced that they’d do it.

Yes, I’m the kind of person who looks for mature stories surrounding real situations and characters with depth, and animation has provided and should provide more mature stories than so many American movie studios think it can. Animation should be treated like the kind of art it is. But animation can’t just have one single personality. As proven with all its original programming from Steven to PPG 2016, no matter how good, Cartoon Network is just too real now to even be considered 'Cartoon' Network. That doesn't mean to say that this new version of Cartoon Network shouldn't embrace influence or teach acceptance, especially in this age of a president with a desire to barricade his people against any ""terrorists"" who aren't white or cisgendered, but to do so without pandering would require subtlety, something the Crewniverse fails to recognise.

Opinions on this show are respectable, but this fandom has grown to be a clustercuss that in many cases fills in for bronies; almost everyone I know has Peridot or a gem’s meme-y face as their icon and will spoil an episode for what feels like an eternity after its premiere. Some fans will even look past the show’s morals about acceptance no matter what size, gender, sexuality, mental issue or whatnot and trash each other to the brink of suicide. I’m losing enjoyment of this show even during its best episodes not just because it isn’t as effective as, say, Wander Over Yonder or BoJack Horseman, but the thoughts of this fandom and the slow death of comedy at the CN Studios invade my brain constantly and make me feel like a bitter old man trapped in the body of guy in his early 20′s. And during this experience, Lauren Zuke Joss Whedon’d her Twitter because of fans crying like the characters in this show over their ships.

After two episodes, that raise more questions than they answer, its hard to tell. So far, what can be clearly enunciated is a quality back story. A story that's akin to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, with a dystopian, almost cyber punk setting, in an underground, end of the world, style bunker. 

A strong cast back up, the so far, elaborate story and setting. Like the story itself, the characterisations have a subdued quality about them. This is due to this underground societies desire to keep hidden its past, rather than see it revealed. Finding out too much, can have fatal consequences.

<br />Season rating: 8/10

Still my favourite show, even ten seasons in.

This feels like a very long season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant a near twelve-month run from episode one to sixteen. That isn't the show's fault of course. Due to that, I had to refresh my mind as to what happened between E1/16 and a lot does occur in S10. I enjoyed all of it, I particularly love how gory the show is at times while the look of the walkers continues to impress with each episode. I like the S10 storyline, very intrigued to see how the final season goes.

Norman Reedus (Daryl), Danai Gurira (Michonne), Melissa McBride (Carol) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Negan) remain the pick of the show's cast, but you also have the likes of Samantha Morton (Alpha) and Ryan Hurst (Beta) in there too. Cailey Fleming (Judith) is still remarkable, she acts way beyond her young years. There are a few others who are good too.

325,The Walking Dead,"Action & Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.1,"Paul Cantor has spoken well of this series. So at a moment I started binging on this series.

The first season was okay. Not so good, but far better than the crap losers tell people ”you have to watch the first five seasons till the action starts”. Watchable.

The second season got more interesting. One has to get past the unlimited ammo, and the unlimited gas available. After all these are the stupid kids who wanted to make momma proud: I got a college diploma, it's Creative Writing. The interaction was okay.

The third season and things are picking up. Never mind the breeding the specie mission. These are individuals. And they are cooperating to get past the greater obstacles, than they are out, each on their way. Nice.

Negan was annoying. He was over the top. And that was good. After all Negan is the Government: sadistic, ready to destroy anything that doesn't obey his whims, he has rules, and prisons, and reeducation, and justice.

And everything was okay, up to season 8. In season 8, the team slowly turns into a nationalistic bureaucracy. People have to sacrifice, not to save their dear ones, but ”for the tribe”. The good guys turn into monsters, and they are starting to lead politics: they ”civilize” the outsiders, or kill them all, just like Negan. All the characters become toxic: from trying to survive, they are now planning how to massacre ”them” before ”they” ”get” ”us”. Disgusting.

Season 8 was a let down. Season 9 was deplorable. Everybody had a little Negan inside, ready to get out and choke humanity out of any living being.

Season 10, well, I should not have watched it, but you know: National House Arrest. Everything becomes a regular sitcom: more and more characters are injected. They characters are diverse, because god willed it. The story becomes so dull, they have to splice many stories, and blend them together. So Team 1 is about to find out something, switch, Team 2 does something, but… switch, Team 3 is certain that something, switch, Team 1 found out the house is empty, they are planning their next move, when they hear a noise, switch, Team 2.

And now I am watching Season 11. Why? I have no idea. Maybe to say: I have watched it all. At least this is the last one, otherwise I would have waited for the next benevolent lockdown. Not only the boring stories are blended closer together, they are getting way beyond unlimited ammo: they get into a tunnel, to have some action, because they are not looking for anything in the tunnel. There is nobody behind. And in front there are bodies in bags. The zombies, after 12 years in bags, they are quite functional. And like the sensor in the fridge, one has to get close enough so they could start making the noise. And in the train there are zombies. And behind now it's full of zombies.

This show shows us that there are good people in every race and this show doesn't contain hate. It tells us that everyone is equal like it's supposed to be.

366,Midsomer Murders,"Crime, Drama, Mystery",7.5,"We have now watched every season of Midsomer Murders so far, and that is a lot. So you know we like the program. It took a few shows for us to get a sense that the it is a pastiche of police shows. I don’t mean that it is a comedy or makes fun of the genre; just that it turns it on its head a little.

For one thing, it seems there are always about three murders per episode, and they are not 90 minute shows. They aren’t serial killings; it just seems like for one reason or another, circumstances call for repeat killings.

Besides the three-peat murders, there is also a sort of formula the episodes often follow. A lot of the shows either include a pseudo supernatural element, or they take place during some kind of festival or fete. People from a character’s past also play into a lot of shows, and if you are squeamish and someone says “What are you doing here?” Look away for just a moment. Plus, perhaps out of necessity since there are so many murders, they come up with imaginative ways of doing it. Not always plausible, mind you, but all part of the fun.

So it is a pleasant show. The recurring characters are likable and their personal plot lines provide continuity for the one-&and-done mystery for each episode. 

If you are dubious but still give it a try, watch at least three episodes. It grows on you. If you have Roku tv channels, there is one channel that runs just Midsomer Murders, though I imagine not in any sensible order. Don’t let then20-plus seasons put you off.

469,Castle,"Drama, Crime",8.0,"Richard Castle is a successful best-selling author, twice married and twice divorced, living in a spacious Manhattan condo with the single actress mother (Martha) who raised him and a bright teenage daughter (Alexis). He has money, toys, and rotating women, but he’s bored. So bored in fact that he has killed off his best-selling character, Derrick Storm, a rogue prone to danger. Castle’s looking for something new.

Enter Kate Beckett, a strong forceful female homicide detective. The fact that she’s also hot is irrelevant to her, but not to Castle. A serial killer is committing murders and staging them to look like kills from Castle’s books, so Beckett needs to interview him. He’s all play, she’s all business. She doesn’t think that he’s likely involved, but she has to interview him anyway.

Castle is hooked. He convinces the mayor to “let” him work the case as a consultant/advisor, much to Beckett’s dismay, and the game is afoot. Castle helps solve the case, and the successful partnership continues so Castle can do research.

As the opening narration reveals, every writer has his muse, and Castle thinks he’s found his. He even bases a new character on her — Nikki Heat. A strong forceful female homicide detective who works with a roguish mystery writer to solve cases. With a small difference — in his books, the two are lovers, which Castle wants to replicate with Beckett. But like I said, she’s all business.

Season 1: Beckett brings the serious, Castle makes it fun. 4/5

Season 2: Season 2 starts with Beckett and Castle on the outs, as she’s pissed at him for looking into her mother’s case at the end of season 1. By the end of the season, Castle is starting to give up the romantic chase, just as Beckett starts to think she likes the chase. 3/5

Season 3: This is the season where Castle hits its stride. Beckett and Castle are in a good place after the first couple of episodes, they’re in their groove, and they’re even making progress on the conspiracy that claimed Beckett’s mother. 4/5

Season 4: Building off Season 3, this season really starts to gel in certain areas. Which is odd, because the characters are written so they are NOT gelling…Castle finished off Season 3 with a big pronouncement, and Beckett says she doesn’t remember it. So they are at odds for most of the season. They have their moments, and then they have stumbling blocks. While a lot of Seasons 1-3 were about Castle growing up a little, finding something to care about besides being a playboy writer, this season is about Beckett growing as a person, finding something to care about other than her job. 4/5

Season 5: I really want to love this season, and there are some seriously good episodes, like Ryan going undercover or the Rear Window episode. And while the average is higher for individual EPs, driving the season up to 4.0 overall, my overall satisfaction was down — the backstory just wasn’t working for me any more around Bracken, 3XK, Beckett’s mom, and the wildside of Castle’s Dad’s story (great premise, not awesomely executed). 4/5

Season 6: The season starts off with Beckett working in Washington, and the whole dynamic just doesn’t work. I like the 3XK stuff, and a Carrie-like prank. I’ll even accept the wedding episode. But not a great season overall, one of the lower average scores so far. 3/5

Season 7: As I watched the episodes, I frequently felt, “Okay, last season”. Quite a few Eps seem like repeats of story ideas they’ve used before or promising ones that go nowhere. I was initially skeptical of the “Castle as P.I.” plot device, but it isn’t completely batty in its execution, and it does work for the most part. Washington? Not so much. 3/5

Season 8: There is an episode near the end (E19) that is one of the best of the series…it is funny, it is interesting, it is vintage Season 1 and 4 all together in a big bowl of mystery with comedy sprinkled on top. A complete palate cleanser from all the Eps filled with Angst. Yet by the time I got there, the first half of the season was almost making me wonder if I would continue watching. Definitely near the bottom of the seasons. 3/5","Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Molly C.

478,Stranger Things,"Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery",8.6,"**Season 3 - SPOILER-FREE Review**

If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com

Stranger Things first appeared in our lives back in 2016 with its phenomenal first season, followed by a less amazing yet still entertaining Season 2. I was pretty excited for the third adventure with one of the best (if not the best) young ensemble casts ever. The acting in this show is unbelievable, even more when considering the age of most of the kids (14-17). Millie Bobby Brown is 15-years-old! Fifteen! Weirdly, the show will only be eligible for next year's Emmy's, but if she doesn't get nominated AND win, I sincerely don't know what she needs to do more. The seamless ease that Millie has in showing emotion and delivering those subtle expressions that only the best actors can achieve after years of experience ... She's going to break the Oscar record for youngest Best Actress / Best Supporting Actress winner. It's meant to happen.

I started with her because last season I handed the highlight crown to Noah Schnapp (Will Byers) who also gives an excellent performance, even if his character has less to do this time around (similar to the debut season). Of all the young actors, Millie is so much ahead of her fellow colleagues that she indirectly diminishes Sadie Sink's (Max) performance. They have completely different emotional responses to similarly painful events. Not that Sadie isn't able to transmit her feelings (I enjoyed both her and her character a lot more this season), but jumping from Eleven showing 200% of her emotion to any other character is always going to feel that the other actor/actress isn't at her level (truthfully though, they aren't).

In addition to Millie, the other standout has to be David Harbour as Jim Hopper. This might be the funniest season so far, as well as the most emotionally powerful. Both are due to Hopper's arc and Harbour's award-worthy performance. He's hilarious, happy, sad, angry, drunk, frustrated, proud, ... His arc is definitely the one that serves as a pillar to this season's structure. Without him, this season wouldn't be near to the quality it is. Harbour's chemistry with Winona Ryder (Joyce Byers) is palpable, and that's basically enough for me to have a great time. However, The Duffer Brothers really deserve a lot of credit. The writing is some of the best I've seen in the last few years.

Everyone hated Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) in the first season, but his development got such a fantastic treatment that now everyone loves him. The same happens with Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery). I genuinely hated him last season due to how cliche and lazily written he was. Now, even though his backstory isn't anything innovative, he's undoubtedly seen as a more compelling character, which proves that Stranger Things really doesn't have a single bad character (main or supporting, at least). Max also gets a better script, plus her on-screen time with Eleven helped the character become more interesting. Nevertheless, how's the main gang?!

Well, Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson) spends less time with his original friends, but his side adventure with Steve, Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson), and Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke), the newest addition to the show which is also the best surprise of the season, is also pretty entertaining even if it's connected to one of my issues (more on that soon). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), Will, Eleven, and Max have a whole romantic subplot that I surprisingly enjoyed mostly due to how realistic and heartfelt The Duffer Brothers wrote it. Obviously, comedy is always a must inside this group, and I wasn't disappointed, having dropped more than just a few laughs throughout the episodes.

Finally, Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers) and Natalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler) also have their own inspiring journey, the one that addresses the most how people had to live in the 80s. Dealing with discrimination, workplace injustices, and different lifestyles are put in perspective always through unforced dialogue and/or events. I really loved this season structure. How each group of characters has their own side adventure so that in the end, they can all team-up together to defeat the evil within Hawkins. I never felt bored or less engaged in a story. Season 2 had that horrible episode with Kali (Linnea Berthelson), and some episodes seemed to drag. Season 3 not only has the perfect runtime for each episode, but the story that they cover during each chapter is always remarkably captivating.

Of course, I always felt more entertained when Eleven and Hopper were on-screen, so their subplots obviously became my favorites. However, they don't take anything away from the remaining stories or characters. Evidence number one would be the best ending of the show. It's hard to hold off the tears during those last few moments, especially if you went through the same event (which 99% of people definitely did unless you had literally zero friends growing up). Technically, the show proves that you don't need a big budget to provide visual delight. From the appropriated costume design to the addictive 80s' style soundtrack, everything is on-point with tons of practical effects being employed. The CGI regarding the monsters and everything that comes with them are convincing enough, and the action sequences are mostly shot well. The editing gets a little sloppy near the final episodes, but nothing too serious.

My main and only issue with this season has to be the actual main plot. The thread that connects all of the subplots and groups of characters that I've been praising so much. Besides being very similar to the last season (monster comes, possesses people, and you know the rest), it's worse regarding the ""how"" and ""why"" the monsters came back. There's a whole story involving Russians, secret bases and codes, that feel too cheesy and over-the-top, reaching a level of absurdity that even affected some action scenes ""a la Fast and Furious"". It's unusual for the main plot to be as cliche and uninteresting as it is, while the side stories are astonishingly good.

All in all, Stranger Things delivers yet another fantastic season. Its debut continues to hold the #1 spot, but Season 3 is so much better than its predecessor. Once again, the characters are what make this show a massive success. Even separating everyone into different groups, the cast's phenomenal chemistry remains intact. Millie Bobby Brown takes her crown back from Season 2's highlight, Noah Schnapp, and guarantees herself tons of nominations and hopefully a few awards, due to a perfect display of her emotional range. David Harbour is right behind her, and then comes the rest of the ensemble cast, one of the best to ever grace a TV screen. The Duffer Brothers are masterful screenwriters, presenting extremely developed character scripts, as well as funny, exciting and entertaining side stories. Despite a less strong main plot, Stranger Things finishes this season with the best ending of the entire series. If you're not crying during the last 10 minutes … I don't know. Can't wait for Season 4, even if I would be more than satisfied to see it end its run now.

Well, thankfully, that's not the case. The latest season adds new material and fleshes out the overall back story. Its suitably creepy too, with yet more 80's style nostalgia and one of my favourite Kate Bush songs.

Its not helped by a lead character, the Doctor, who unsurprisingly, does not appear to know what she is supposed to be. Small wonder, when the overall vibe coming from the show, is so conflicted.

622,Sex Education,"Comedy, Drama",8.2,"I'll be brief.  I am a black man, and I do not appreciate homsexuality being put into black characers.  I cannot be as candid as I wish about this series, but I will be honest as I can.

I like sex.  I like movies and shows where sexual nudity is a strong possibility.  I have no problem seeing a naked man, although I can see why entertainment has kept the naked man out of view of the camera all these many years up to 2010.  Male genitals are not very...appealing, aestetically; nor are they all that impressive.  But in a world of false equality, ""what's good for goose is good for the gander"", eh? 

But I digress.  I like movies and shows dealing with sex, but I cannot muster the same vigor for watching a show when that brand of entertainment is mired in aspects of liberal social views.  CRT, homosexuality, inclusivity, gender indentifcation, mysandry, uneven outcomes of equity, and cancel culture are all carcengenic facets or factors that keep the ""enterain"" out of entertainment.  It's hard to know when the funny parts play out in a show with such farcical overtures; especially when people who hold these views first reaction to negative feedback is to brow-beat or bully critics. It's hard to write a story anyone care's about when they can't relate to any of the characters.  And the fact that these social views can take so much away from a show with a well liked aspect of life, is calamitous.   

What care do I have to see a woman with an attractive body when I know (because of inclusivity) she will never get naked on screen?  Why in the world would I be interested in seeing two guys kiss, much less in naked in bed together?  Why should I believe a woman is the leader of a combat squad, when they don't even play first person shooter video games?  Why not flip channels when the lesbian character, with a guy's haircut and clothes, starts making out with another woman??  

The aspects of social liberal views don't make good entertainment because they are NOT norms.  If they are not norms then there is no interest.  If there is no interest, then every single script is a grindfest to keep the storyline consistent and believeable.  The same goes for this show.  I'm not interested because I have no anticipation for seeing those things.  They don't incite anticipation or interest because they don't appeal to me.  Personally, I get sick of trying to tell the males from females with shows like this one; and even then you have to wait and see who they pair with later in the show just to get some kind of context on WHY they make the choices they make.  Too convoluted.  Too unnecessarily convoluted. 

And even if this show is supposedly doing well ratings wise, I'd take that with a lot of salt.  Because the 'alphabet people' have the money to buy reviews.  If I have to say, I'd say my critique would be on the Popcorn Viewers' side of ""Rotten Red Vegtables.""  And it is not high at all.  I didn't rate this show because even half a star is too much credit.  You don't boost mediocrity.

It's enough to watch the 1st episode to see how lazy it is.
 
But then I thought, ok, they didn't bother to give any meaningful backstory to any character, they didn't write any real speech that is not cringe-macho, maybe they went crazy in fights and animation? I'm up for some pulp.

Answer is no. Every fight is more or less the same, one guy inflicts an incredible amount of damage on the other, seemingly winning the match, but the opponent just stands up and inflicts double the damage, only to have the 1st guy standing up and repeating. Repeat this formula once, twice or three times and you have EVERY fight in the anime. No techniques, no speed vs strength, no kung-fu vs karate, no height vs weight, NOTHING, JUST DAMAGE.

Then random characters will keep appearing, the latest is obviously the strongest ever, until next episode where a new guy with no backstory is even stronger, or when another random guy beats him...

645,Fear The Walking Dead,"Action & Adventure, Drama",7.66,"Let me preface this by saying that if “Fear the Walking Dead” wanted to prove it had nothing left in the tank—no shred of narrative originality or dimensional character development—it’s certainly achieved that. This spin-off series feels like a rehashed casserole of old “The Walking Dead” plotlines, with an extra sprinkle of stale empowerment tropes that bludgeon you over the head rather than convince you of their authenticity. Don’t get me wrong: strong female leads can be amazing. However, this show’s approach to showcasing female strength feels less like a well-written narrative and more like a ham-fisted exercise in ticking boxes and making every male character look like they’re competing in a marathon of cluelessness.

From the moment the first episode staggers onscreen, “Fear the Walking Dead” seems utterly terrified—ironic, given the name—of allowing its men to be anything but incompetent or flat-out disposable. The female characters dominate every scenario, not by outsmarting equally clever male antagonists or allies, but by virtue of the writing force-feeding us lopsided characterizations. This kind of hackneyed scripting doesn’t highlight feminism; it cheapens it. Rather than craft complex individuals, the show often defaults to lazy stereotypes: men who can’t get their act together and women who correct every ill with an eye-roll and a scornful lecture. It’s less an ensemble and more a joyless, lopsided lecture on how to marginalize half of your cast.

Beyond its gender politics, let’s talk about the plot—or rather, the endless absence of one. The show recycles the same old survival tropes, shuffling from one dead-end location to the next, each encounter feeling like a bad rerun. The characters make bafflingly poor decisions that don’t feel organic or revealing but simply serve the writers’ need to keep a “conflict” going. It’s a never-ending cycle of nonsensical stand-offs, unnecessary melodrama, and forced moralistic moments that have all the subtlety of a zombie gnawing on a traffic cone.

As for the production value, it’s nothing to write home about. While AMC can deliver moody visuals and grimy sets like it’s nobody’s business, the show’s aesthetics are the best thing it has to offer—and that’s a pretty low bar. Even the action sequences feel repetitive and drained of creativity. It’s as if the camera operators got as bored as we did and just decided to press “record” on a carousel of random zombies. Meanwhile, dialogue is delivered with such contrived earnestness that you start to pity the actors. They’re good performers stuck in a narrative noose, forced to recite lines that do little more than remind you why you stopped caring three episodes ago.

In short, “Fear the Walking Dead” is the TV equivalent of stale bread. The show desperately wants to come off as progressive and edgy but ends up feeling like a shrill echo chamber of worn-out clichés and one-dimensional character dynamics. It’s about as innovative as a broken lawnmower and about as balanced as a three-legged chair. If you’re looking for a world brimming with nuance, character growth, or genuinely empowering storytelling for anyone (men or women), you won’t find it here. Instead, you’ll find a sloppy, man-bashing, condescending mess that fails to deliver meaningful tension or insight.

676,True Detective,"Drama, Mystery",8.3,"Im writing this review solely on the first season. I never finished the second one as i write this.

I can easily say that Season 1 of this show was absolutely stunning. Some of the finest TV Crime hours of my life. We have Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in some of their best roles of their career. Especially the latter of them. McConaughey made the talk of the town with his role as the smart, and deeply intellect detective Cole and to be honest, i have rarely seen a role played out so well by an actor in years. He absolutely grabs you in and keeps you there for the entire show.

It is all set in the rural deep humid swamps of Louisiana. The photography here is top notch. It is shot in a way that you can actually smell the place while watching. It just brings you that close to the swamps of the south.

Featuring a great selection of music by T-Bone Burnett who scored Coen´s brothers ""O´Brother Where Art Though"" to critical acclaim. He is the number one man to bring in for some true Americana music to movie and TV projects. He seldom fails. It opened eyes to many new artists for me.

The show has a great momentum until the end. Somehow the end of the season, i felt, was very rushed and simplified. In my opinion, could been done smarter to justify the rest of the show. But that is just nitpicking. For why bother the rest of the show is near perfection in TV making and gives you so much to weigh in on. You should not miss it at all. It will leave you wanting to smell the swamps even more after the last episode.

 - Nic Pizzolatto

A murder mystery set in small-town southern America, focusing on a dedicated cop who drinks too much, letting the case burrow under his skin and destroy his personal life as he chases answers across multiple time periods. But underneath, it's about more than that – it's about personal demons, good and evil, the soul, American identity, memory, time. And as the case progresses, a conspiracy slowly comes into focus. There may even be a supernatural element. Thus was the first season of _True Detective_. And thus is the third. With one major difference – season one was ground-breaking, one of the finest seasons of TV ever made, a defining early example of prestige TV. Season three, on the other hand, is, well…put it this way, of all the shows I've ever seen, season three of _True Detective_ is one of them.

Okay, okay, I'm being flippant. But there's no denying the similarities between seasons one and three. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing – I mean who would want a repeat of the horrendous and universally panned second season? So creator/writer/showrunner Nic Pizzolatto returning to his roots for the third outing is, on paper anyway, a good idea. The problem is that because this season is _so_ similar to season one, it's practically crying out for people to judge it in the light of those glorious episodes from 2014. And the contrast is not flattering.

This being _True Detective_, there is a lot to praise – the aesthetics are top-notch, the sense of place is palpable, the acting is off-the-chart brilliant. And there are some interesting themes – racial tension, journalistic ethics, marriage, fatherhood, the shadow of the Vietnam War, old age. But this being Pizzolatto unfettered, there's a lot to criticise too – the glacial pace, the under-written female roles, the cod-philosophy, the (toxic) machismo, the clichés, the dreadful finale. The fact is that Pizzolatto (a novelist by trade) needs an exceptional director to turn his ideas into something resembling brilliance, to imbue his relatively quotidian script with a portentousness well beyond the written word. He needs a director with a keen enough vision to mask the fact that his scripts are actually pretty by-the-numbers. Season three illustrates this beyond all doubt. Season one had the vision of Cary Joji Fukunaga (_Beasts of No Nation_, _Jane Eyre_, _Maniac_) who brilliantly directed all eight episodes, presenting a very thin story by way of such unforgettable and unsettling imagery that it made everything feel deeper and more profound than it really was. Season three has such a vision for two episodes; the first two, which are directed by Jeremy Saulnier (_Blue Ruin_, _Green Room_, _Hold the Dark_), who was also a showrunner until he abruptly departed after clashing with Pizzolatto (look out for a stunningly beautiful night-time shot of a search party walking through a field, torches moving in front of them – Sauliner gives the image a haunting fairy-tale-like quality). After these two episodes, directorial duties were split between Pizzolatto himself and journeyman TV director Daniel Sackheim. Season three without Saulnier (or Fukunaga) isn't as bad as season two, nowhere near, but it's still very weak, telling a threadbare story that it stretches out well beyond breaking point only to reward us with the limpest and most poorly written _dénouement_ you can possibly imagine.

The story is split over three time periods. In 1980, in the fictional backwater town of  West Finger, Arkansas, eight-year-old Will Purcell (Phoenix Elkin) and his twelve-year-old sister Julie (Lena McCarthy) go out to play on their bikes and fail to return. When the police are alerted, the case lands on the desk of Wayne Hays (an insanely good Mahershala Ali), a tracker during the Vietnam War, and one of those guys whose mind never really made it home from the jungle, and his partner Roland West (a superb Stephen Dorff). The kids' parents, Tom (a scene-stealing Scoot McNairy) and Lucy (a wonderfully contemplable Mamie Gummer), who hate one another, insist the kids wouldn't run away, and not long into the investigation, they are proven correct. Shortly thereafter, Wayne meets and forms a bond with the kids' English teacher, Amelia Reardon (Carmen Ejogo), who has her own reasons for pursuing the case. Ten years later, in 1990, Hays (now married to Amelia and with two children of their own) is working a dead-end desk job and West is a lieutenant. In the same week that Amelia's book about the case is being published, unexpected evidence comes to light that changes everything. The Purcell case is reopened and West is placed in charge of a special task force to look into it. And then, in 2015, Hays, now a widower suffering from memory loss, begins recording an interview on the case for a true-crime TV show, pushed into doing so by semi-unscrupulous journalist Elisa Montgomery (Sarah Gadon). Talking about the case, however, stirs something in him, and he determines to finally solve the mystery once and for all.

As with the first season, the use of multiple timelines muddies the narrative waters in a manner that wouldn't be possible were the story being told chronologically – the jumping back and forward means that sometimes we have a lot more information than the characters (in relation to the 1980 and 1990 timeline, we are seeing events in their future), but sometimes we have considerably less (in 2015, there are aspects of the case that we aren't privy to, but which the characters know all about). Especially laudable is how the show handles the time jumps, employing a variety of methods that serve to collapse the three different periods into one another. So, for example, a question asked of Hays apparently in 1990 is actually a question he's being asked in 2015, with the sound bridging the picture edit; a streetlight going out in 1980 cuts to a key-light going out in Hays's 2015 interview; a shot of Hays looking through a window in 1980, shows a reflection of his 2015 persona; a single-shot scene in a car depicts the characters repeatedly changing from 1990 to 2015 every time their face is off-screen. It's really well done, and carries thematic significance insofar as memory, particularly its subjectivity, unreliability, and mutability, is one of the main issues being examined throughout the season.

Also laudable is the old-age make-up by Michael Marino (_I Am Legend_, _Black Swan_, _The Irishman_), which is some of the best I've ever seen, and is complemented by an exceptional performance from Ali. He plays Hays differently in each of the three timelines, and it gives the character a believable arc – in 1980, he's driven, confidant, imposing;  in 1990, a sense of bitterness and indignation has crept in, he has a shorter temper and less tolerance for things of which he disapproves; in 2015, he's become a vulnerable and confused old man with just a hint of his past acerbity. It's a bravura performance from Ali, who really does carry the show on his shoulders. This is not to say the other performances are poor – Dorff is exceptional throughout, with his portrayal of West more uniform and unchanging than Ali's (which makes sense as West is more of a company man than Hays), and McNairy is heartbreaking in a somewhat thankless role (an interrogation scene in the sixth episode is worth looking out for). Ejogo is also excellent, although she's shackled by the poorly-written character she's playing, about whom Pizzolatto can't seem to make up his mind. Is she an exploitive opportunist or an empathetic journalist looking for the truth?

And aside from all this, there are some interesting thematic elements dotted throughout the show. Racial tension, for example, is never focused upon, but it's always in the margins, often unspoken. When Hays first meets Amelia (a black woman teaching white kids), he asks her ""_how is it here?_"", to which she replies, ""_it's fine. It's good really, for what it is. I hear something now and then. They're all poor around here; that's the main thing_."" Elsewhere, he refers to his ""_redneck radar_"" and points out to West that they belong to different _""tribes_"". Later he queries if West's promotion was related to his ""_pigmentation_"" and in 2015, Elisa asks him if he ever felt he was being racially discriminated against during the investigations. In another scene, he snaps at a well-intentioned West, ""_please explain to me the hardships and tribulations of being a white man in this country_"". The most direct engagement with race occurs when Hays and West go to question a black man, and tensions quickly rise. Although West points out, ""_we're not going to solve the racial complexities of our day in your front yard_"", the man still asks Hays, ""_how you gonna wear that badge?_"" to which he replies, ""_it's got a little clip-on_"". If only Pizzolatto could be that incisive yet subtle more often.

So if the aesthetics are good and the themes are reasonably well-handled, why is season three a dud? Well, for a few reasons. As already mentioned, it moves at an agonisingly slow pace, and without the visual gymnastics of someone like Fukunaga or Saulnier, the story can't sustain itself – it's stretched way beyond breaking point, lapsing into repetition and narrative strands that go absolutely nowhere. I'm loathe to say it's boring, as I think that's too negative a term, but my God, this story could have been told very efficiently in five episodes, not the indulgent eight Pizzolatto has taken. And yes, I know, it's not really about the murder-mystery, it's about the characters. I get that, and I accept that, and I celebrate any film or TV show which puts character before plot, but the characters here aren't very interesting, and they do an awful lot of moaning. There's certainly no Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) or Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson). Hell, there isn't even a Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell). Hays is brilliantly played, but he's as dull as dish-water, and the 1990-set problems between himself and Amelia, which come to take up an increasing amount of screen-time, are so uninteresting and self-serving, they're difficult to watch (especially when we're watching them have the same argument for the third time). The point is that large sections of the season drag interminably because neither the central mystery nor the main characters are engaging enough to sustain such a slow-moving plot

And then there's the finale. Good Lord. Okay, the finale of season one was weak. It was the episode when Fukunaga's smoke and mirrors cleared and allowed us to see that at the season's core was the tale of a serial killer paedophile. The conspiracy went nowhere, the philosophical musings went nowhere, the supernatural hints went nowhere, and the mythology (the Yellow King, black stars, Carcosa) all boiled down to a psycho living in the swamps who liked having sex with and killing children. It didn't ruin the season, but it was underwhelming. Season three's finale is about five times worse. It's so badly structured and written that I genuinely do not understand how it made it to screen unless there's no one willing to tell Pizzolatto that something isn't a good idea. About three-quarters of the way through the episode, with most of the season's questions still open, a character quite literally sits down and explains everything (and I mean everything). He walks us through every single event and answers almost every single question. It's horrid writing. To hell with the cardinal rule of writing for film or TV, ""show, don't tell""; here we have a finale with a 10-minute exposition dump right at its heart, which literally tells without showing. I don't know of a single criterion by which one can judge that decision a sound one. The last episode is insultingly bad. 

Despite disliking two of the three seasons of _True Detective_, I still consider myself a fan (the first season was that good). But it's starting to look more and more like that first season magic had more to do with the director than the writer. Pizzolatto just doesn't have a unique enough vision to raise the show above the competition, not when he's allowed creative _carte blanche_ anyway. Much like the first season, the mystery at the heart of season three was never as complicated nor as awe-inspiring as it initially seemed, but unlike season one, season three doesn't give us much else to latch onto. The story Pizzolatto is telling and the characters who inhabit it are too weak to support eight hours of narrative architecture. And, by God, that ending really annoyed me!

676,True Detective,"Drama, Mystery",8.3,"Series 2: Below are my observations after watching series 1 a second time, so now I will briefly enter thoughts after rewatching Series 2. I can’t say I enjoyed much of this season. I should point out that it is great drama; it grabs you by the throat and moves you along through the river of violence and betrayal and prolific cursing. (I am known to drop an occasional F-bomb as are my friends and family, but if they all did it this much my Thanksgivings would be quiet ones without company). Plus I was hard-pressed to find people to root for here. The few I liked had little or no power and were, like me, just along for the ride. And I found it ironic that, populated with the modern flawed anti-heroes we get a lot in modern dramatic thrillers or cop shows, there seemed to be an old fashion tendency for arranging fit endings for characters, like a sprawling morality play. But this is typical HBO fare: rather addictive even as I grumbled about my minor complaints above.

Series 1: I recently re-watched the first series of True Detective many years after watching the first time. I don’t know if I will watch the subsequent two series again, and they are unrelated to the first series anyway, so each series should be reviewed separately.

So taking series one on its own, I found it to be great entertainment, despite the presence of a massive, walking and talking stereotype. I refer to one of the two lead detectives. Woody Harrelson’s detective Marty Hart is sort of a cliche character, straight out of many other police procedural mystery series. He checks off several boxes of that two-dimensional role: cheats on wife yet applies his violent double standard at the thought of her doing it, drinking too much, breaking the law to further his investigation, with his anger always near the surface. But I like Woody Harrelson and he does give a textured and layered performance, his sense of humor and how  he cares about the plight of people he encounters (except his family, of course), helped me forget much of the time how thinly drawn his character seemed.

Of course, Mather McConaughey’s character is the opposite: he is complex, always philosophizing, capable of violence when needed but always in control. They are the odd couple of detective partnerships and they are conversely always at odds with each other while still having each other’s back professionally.

The plot is suitably complex enough to maintain interest over eight episodes, though I found the subplot with the motorcycle gang almost felt like action filler material even though it ultimately advances the investigation. And I was vaguely disappointed in the ensemble cast, particularly the rest of the detective team. We learn nothing about them as they lumber through the scenes.

The women in the detectives’ lives are sporadically interesting when they stand up for themselves. I found myself wishing that McConoughey’s doctor girlfriend character would get expanded and filled in, but ultimately this series is about the two main men and how the actions of others affect them. And of course, being an HBO original, you have the prerequisite amount of sex and female nudity.

But season one is definitely compelling  viewing, in the way The Sopranos was, however much one similarly lamented the excessive violence involved.","Jodie Foster, Kali Reis, Fiona Shaw, Finn Bennett, Isabella Star LaBlanc","series 2 : observations watch series 1 second time , briefly enter thoughts rewatching series 2. ’ say enjoy much season . point great drama ; grab throat move along river violence betrayal prolific curse .

676,True Detective,"Drama, Mystery",8.3,"True Detective: Night Country is a gripping and atmospheric thriller that takes the anthology series to new heights. Set in the remote and unforgiving Alaskan wilderness, the show follows two detectives who must overcome their personal and professional differences to solve a mysterious case that involves a missing research team, a severed tongue, and a possible connection to an unsolved murder of a native activist.

Jodie Foster delivers a stunning performance as Detective Liz Danvers, a hardened and cold cop who has been exiled to the small town of Ennis for her attitude and past failures. Foster portrays Danvers as a complex and flawed character who struggles with her own demons and regrets, but also shows glimpses of compassion and vulnerability. She is matched by Kali Reis, who plays Evangeline Navarro, a state trooper of Iñupiat descent who is obsessed with finding justice for the slain activist, Annie. Reis brings a fierce and fiery energy to Navarro, who clashes with Danvers over their methods and motives, but also develops a grudging respect and understanding for her partner.

The show is written and directed by Issa López, who creates a captivating and chilling vision of Alaska as a place of both isolation and freedom, beauty and danger, darkness and light. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the stark contrast between the snowy landscapes and the cozy interiors, the eerie silence and the sudden bursts of violence, the long night and the brief dawn. The soundtrack is also haunting, featuring a mix of native songs, folk tunes, and ambient sounds that enhance the mood and tension of the story.

The plot is intriguing and unpredictable, weaving together elements of crime, mystery, and supernatural horror. The show explores themes such as identity, culture, history, trauma, and redemption, as well as the environmental and social issues facing Alaska and its native people. The show also pays homage to the previous seasons of True Detective, with references and Easter eggs that fans will appreciate, but also stands on its own as a unique and original story.

683,Golden Pouch,"Family, Drama",5.3,"Love Triangle


I finished watching all 122 episodes and have been re-watching the series for more than half a dozen times from beginning to end. I really enjoyed the series because it tells us about how to live our lives to the fullest, and the meaning of families in our lives.

The wisdom and advice from Mr. Geum Jung-do to his adopted son (Dr. Han Seok-Hoon) and his three daughters (Geum Doo-na, Geum Seol-hwa, and Geum Se-na) are so meaningful and heartwarming. The phrases that Grandma Yoon uses also remind me of our elders when they describe the most basic rule of good manners.

There is Love Triangle or rather three sided love triangle in ""Golden Pouch"". This K-drama series is so engaging and so memorable. Firstly, there is Dr. Han Seok-hoon's past relationship with Bae Min-hee, and secondly, both Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Yoon Joon-sang fall in love with Geum Seol-hwa. All lead characters have their own motivation, hopes, values and fears.

There is Bae Min-hee's ambitious motivation after Dr. Han rejects Min-hee when she wants to come back after she left Dr. Han when he loses his memory and cannot perform any surgeries due to his injury. Min-hee's ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" is so dreadful and horrifying to the end of the series.

For the audience, it seems that both Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Yoon Joon-sang are ""perfect person"" for Geum Seol-hwa. Seol-hwa has feeling for Dr. Han, but Seol-hwa's adopted mom, Kim Choo-ja, wants Seol-hwa to marry a perfect and flawless man, the son of the wealthy Yoon family. I find this unique love triangle story does not drag on too long, but is engaging. Will Seol-hwa choose the man that needs her (Dr. Han Seok-hoon) or the man that wants her (Yoon Joon-sang)?

Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Miss Geum Seol-hwa have excellent on-screen chemistry, one of the best I have ever seen, it is unrivalled by any other K-drama series. We really think they have been in love for centuries in “Golden Pouch”. I truly believe I am watching a true story rather than fictional K-drama series. Seol-hwa is so lovely. Dr. Han is so kind and never gives up on his patients, including his love of his life ""patient"", Seol-Hwa. He is really serious on his work in the surgical theater. Dr. Han and Geum Seol-hwa's love is so pure and genuine.

However, I find the ending of the “Golden Pouch” series is inconclusive and unsatisfactory. There is no wedding for Dr. Han and Ms. Geum Seol-hwa nor do the Yoon and Geum families eat dumplings at the Dumplings Shop to conclude the drama series. I would be profoundly delighted if you could produce a two-hour feature TV movie that starts with the wedding between Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Ms. Geum Seol-hwa and ends with Yoon and Geum families eating dumplings together at the Dumplings shop.

683,Golden Pouch,"Family, Drama",5.3,"Love Triangle

I just finished watching all 122 episodes and have been re-watching the series for more than half a dozen times from beginning to end. I really enjoyed the series because it tells us about how to live our lives to the fullest, and the meaning of families in our lives.

The wisdom and advice from Mr. Geum Jung-do to his adopted son (Dr. Han Seok-Hoon) and his three daughters (Geum Doo-na, Geum Seol-hwa, and Geum Se-na) are so meaningful and heartwarming. The phrases that Grandma Yoon uses also remind me of our elders when they describe the most basic rule of good manners.

There is Love Triangle or rather three sided love triangle in ""Golden Pouch"". This K-drama series is so engaging and so memorable. Firstly, there is Dr. Han Seok-hoon's past relationship with Bae Min-hee, and secondly, both Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Yoon Joon-sang fall in love with Geum Seol-hwa. All lead characters have their own motivation, hopes, values and fears.

There is Bae Min-hee's ambitious motivation after Dr. Han rejects Min-hee when she wants to come back after she left Dr. Han when he loses his memory and cannot perform any surgeries due to his injury. Min-hee's ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" is so dreadful and horrifying to the end of the series.

For the audience, it seems that both Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Yoon Joon-sang are ""perfect person"" for Geum Seol-hwa. Seol-hwa has feeling for Dr. Han, but Seol-hwa's adopted mom, Kim Choo-ja, wants Seol-hwa to marry a perfect and flawless man, the son of the wealthy Yoon family. I find this unique love triangle story does not drag on too long, but is engaging. Will Seol-hwa choose the man that needs her (Dr. Han Seok-hoon) or the man that wants her (Yoon Joon-sang)?

Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Miss Geum Seol-hwa have excellent on-screen chemistry, one of the best I have ever seen, it is unrivalled by any other K-drama series. We really think they have been in love for centuries in “Golden Pouch”. I truly believe I am watching a true story rather than fictional K-drama series. Seol-hwa is so lovely. Dr. Han is so kind and never gives up on his patients, including his love of his life ""patient"", Seol-Hwa. He is really serious on his work in the surgical theater. Dr. Han and Geum Seol-hwa's love is so pure and genuine.

However, I find the ending of the “Golden Pouch” series is inconclusive and unsatisfactory. There is no wedding for Dr. Han and Ms. Geum Seol-hwa nor do the Yoon and Geum families eat dumplings at the Dumplings Shop to conclude the drama series. I would be profoundly delighted if you could produce a two-hour feature TV movie that starts with the wedding between Dr. Han Seok-hoon and Ms. Geum Seol-hwa and ends with Yoon and Geum families eating dumplings together at the Dumplings shop.

_Disclaimer: I haven't read the books._

You can re-cast characters, and play the same thing differently. That's OK.

The Reacher we get in the Tom Cruise variant is perceptive, clever, cautious; he relies on his wits and knowledge of human nature. He does what he thinks necessary and right, tends to avoid collateral damage. He's a loner, and perfectly fine with it.

The Reacher we get in the Alan Ritchson variant is a Hulk with penchant for killing; he leaves behind a trail of destruction and corpses. He pretends to be a loner, but is a lost team player in the end.

It's like James Bond versus the A-Team. Both enjoyable, similar topics, but very different in tonality and production.


One more aspect: the Cruise-Reacher is like a modern Yojimbo.
The Ritchson one is written like a power fantasy: invincible avenger walks through walls to right the wrongs.

I will just share some of my impressions and come to a conclusion.

The show is boring and does not pull you in. After watching the first 3 episodes, I am still not interested at all in what's going on.

Galadriel as an or maybe as THE main character of the show is miscast and badly written. She is supposed to be one of the most beautiful and graceful women of all Middle Earth and its history - but she comes across as bland and average in terms of charisma. And she is written as a very unlikable annoying arrogant person.

The casting in general: let's just say that a lot of casting choices do not represent Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth well. The writers and producers seem to not understand the idea of a fully independent fantasy world that is based on its own history and evolution and not the history and evolution of our world. It has to be coherent in itself and not represent our modern day world - that's why it's called ""Fantasy"". Especially when it comes to the fantasy world of Tolkien's ""Middle Earth""! And by inserting the modern day society conditions and ideology into the world of ""Middle Earth"" the makers of this show make this show look less like ""Middle Earth"" and more like our modern day world, which Tolkien Fans certainly don't want to be inserted and represented in a show about ""Middle Earth"".

Elves appear more like kind of Romans, they do not look and feel like Tolkien elves. Giving them short haircuts is a bad decision and an example for how the makers of this show made the Elves more like humans with pointy ears than real Elves that are a different people. Bad casting choices (see explanation above) there, too. Also, for some reason there are aged-looking elves in the show, though elves are not supposed to be aging to the point that they look like old people.

The dialogues (and monologues) are often cringe and stupid - they often try hard to sound poetic, but lack substance and talent on the side of the writers.

In some regard the show is more like ""Dungeons & Dragons"" meets ""Middle Earth"" than actual ""Middle Earth"".

Visually, the show is often just a cheap uninspired copy of the aesthetics of the Peter Jackson movies. You can see the money they put in, but you can't see true inspiration or authentic artistic vision there.

It doesn't do the show any good that it is not based on any stories actually written by Tolkien, but only on some references from the ""Appendices"" and it just uses some characters from ""The Hobbit"" and the Ring Trilogy. So this show tells a story with which the (seemingly rather talentless) writers came up themselves which feels like bad fan-fiction (which is essentially truly is).

Bottom Line/Conclusion: It could have worked as some fantasy TV show that is not based on Tolkien's works - for people who get along with this vision (inspired a lot by certain ideology and modern day conditions) of a fantasy world. I personally would have perceived such a show somewhat polished, but essentially mediocre and accordingly would have been my rating; and then I would have ignored the show for the rest of its lifetime. But as this show is supposed to represent ""Middle Earth"" from the according works of Tolkien, one simply has to acknowledge and point out that it is a big failure. The majority of Tolkien fans reject this bastardization of Tolkien's source material, and they do this for good reasons.","Charlie Vickers, Morfydd Clark, Robert Aramayo, Charles Edwards, Owain Arthur","* * bad fan-fiction - could mediocre fantasy show , middle earth show failure . * * share impressions come conclusion . show bore pull . watch first 3 episodes , still interest 's go . galadriel maybe main character show miscast badly write . suppose one beautiful graceful women middle earth history - come across bland average term charisma . write unlikable annoy arrogant person . cast general : let 's say lot cast choices represent tolkien 's vision middle earth well . writers producers seem understand idea fully independent fantasy world base history evolution history evolution world . coherent represent modern day world - 's 's call `` fantasy '' . especially come fantasy world tolkien 's `` middle earth '' ! insert modern day society condition ideology world `` middle earth '' makers show make show look less like `` middle earth '' like modern day world , tolkien fan certainly n't want insert represent show `` middle earth '' . elves appear like kind romans , look feel like tolkien elves . give short haircuts bad decision example makers show make elves like humans pointy ears real elves different people . bad cast choices ( see explanation ) , . also , reason aged-looking elves show , though elves suppose age point look like old people . dialogues ( monologues ) often cringe stupid - often try hard sound poetic , lack substance talent side writers . regard show like `` dungeons & dragons '' meet `` middle earth '' actual `` middle earth '' . visually , show often cheap uninspired copy aesthetics peter jackson movies . see money put , ca n't see true inspiration authentic artistic vision . n't show good base stories actually write tolkien , reference `` appendices '' use character `` hobbit '' ring trilogy . show tell story ( seemingly rather talentless ) writers come feel like bad fan-fiction ( essentially truly ) . bottom line/conclusion : could work fantasy tv show base tolkien 's work - people get along vision ( inspire lot certain ideology modern day condition ) fantasy world . personally would perceive show somewhat polish , essentially mediocre accordingly would rat ; would ignore show rest lifetime . show suppose represent `` middle earth '' accord work tolkien , one simply acknowledge point big failure . majority tolkien fan reject bastardization tolkien 's source material , good reason .",-1,-1

770,Dragon Ball Super,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.191,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

Dragon Ball Super is the official (or canon, whatever you prefer) follow-up to Dragon Ball Z (yes, Dragon Ball GT does not ""exist"") and it continues right after the Majin Buu arc. Goku goes on action-packed adventures, finding new worlds, strong warriors and limit-breaking powers, which will unfold through five arcs. This will still be a spoiler-free review, but you should know at least the synopsis of each arc.

We will have memorable characters return to the screen, like Trunks or Freeza, as well as new powerful enemies who our warriors will have to defeat in order to protect everyone they love.

I am a huge fan of Dragon Ball! I didn't exactly grow up while it was live, but the show kept being transmitted on TV for years without end. I love everything about it, from the awesome fight scenes to the well-developed storylines that always delivered the final punch. So, when I heard that Dragon Ball Super was going to be Akira Toriyama's next official series, I was incredibly excited! Two movies were released before the anime: Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F'. Both of these films are amazing. While the first is overall better due to its captivating story, the latter is packed with action and it surely appeals more to fans that care more about the fights (even more when we bring the most popular villain ever, Freeza, back to life).

I will approach this review by discussing the pros and cons of each arc. I will keep everything spoiler-free, mentioning only the premise of each arc and eventually some new characters, so don't worry. First of all, I want to be clear: Dragon Ball Z is a masterpiece! It’s a series that completely changed the future of anime and its influence is undeniable. Consequently, Z created its own cliches and typical cheesy moments. If you are a hardcore Dragon Ball fan like myself, these aspects never bothered you.

Obviously, Super has the same cliches and some of them don't really work nowadays. However, this is Dragon Ball! It is not trying to be a contender for a writing award, it just wants to convey the same emotions Z did. I think a lot of people complained about Super while forgetting that Z also had the same plot points. Different times, different perspectives, I guess. That said, let me get to it!

Battle of Gods Arc / Resurrection 'F' Arc
Battle of Gods: C
Resurrection 'F': D+

This is the tough bit ... These arcs are awfully bad. The animation is horrible, especially in the second arc, which at the time was a major cause for concern because no improvement was being made. While Beerus x Goku has its good moments, Goku x Freeza is one of the biggest letdowns in the entire Dragon Ball history. Besides that, these arcs basically repeat the movies, so these are almost 30 episodes which we already know what is going to happen.

However, I encourage NOT to entirely skip these episodes. While I agree that watching the films is a much better way to go through these arcs (the movies' animation is beautiful), the series does a good job of fixing some of the films' minor issues. The characters receive the backstory they need to justify some of the movies' plot points which feel ""out of nowhere"". Overall, these are definitely the worst arcs of Super, but it is possible to avoid the suffering by watching the films instead, while also watching some of the setup episodes of each arc, in order to understand the movies' plots.

Universe 6 Arc: B+

This is the arc that every fan was waiting for. The Universes 6 and 7 will fight for the Super Dragon Balls in a tournament with the same rules of the fan-favorite World Martial Arts Tournament. The series' first original story introduces phenomenal new characters, like Cabba, Frost, Champa and the standout, Hit. The animation improved a lot and the very first epic moment of the saga happens when Goku fights Hit. It’s the first time where the soundtrack elevates the moment and makes everything way more awesome .. and it won’t be the last.

The new characters are captivating and have great backstories to develop in future episodes, with a couple of exceptions. The interactions between them and the originals are the main source of entertainment and character development. It’s a major improvement on the previous arcs and it’s the first sign that Super might actually become a great show. However, the animation still has its bad moments here and there, some characters' designs are unimaginative and the beginning of the tournament is not that great. All in all, it’s a step in the right direction ...

Future Trunks Arc: A

If the last arc is a sign that Super is getting better, this one confirms it. Not only it delivers the return of another fan-favorite character, Trunks, it provides the best premise in the anime's history! Goku Black is destroying Trunks' world so, just like in the Cell Saga, Vegeta's son goes back in time to ask for help. I never thought that plot twists and mystery will be features of a Dragon Ball arc ... I was wrong. This is by far the best story in the entire anime. The mystery surrounding the identity of Goku Black keeps the viewers enthralled even when the episodes lack action. Filler episodes don't really exist because every episode gives us another hint and keeps the plot moving forward, so the entertainment levels are always extremely high. The animation reaches its highest level since the beginning with wonderfully drawn action sequences and beautiful new transformations.

Trunks is connected to some of the arc's most badass moments, even though the power levels feel a bit exaggerated. Goku and especially Vegeta have a lot of jaw-dropping fights and the soundtrack once again is on point. Undoubtedly, the best arc of Super so far. It delivers a mysteriously twistful story, filled with incredible animation and amazingly choreographed fights. It only loses some of its logic when it comes to power levels and how the supposedly weaker characters can overpower the strong ones.

Tournament of Power Arc: A+

Most. Epic. Arc. Ever.

8 Universes, each with a team of 10 fighters, battle for their survival in a tournament similar to the one in the Universe 6 Arc. This is the one that floors me. The amount of emotions I went through is not healthy. My jaw hurts due to so many awesome moments to witness. This tournament goes on for a year and I can't throw away any episode. Honestly, anything that I will write here is not nearly enough to describe how memorable this arc is. I cried at the end of it all. I had chills all over my body for an episode's entire runtime. There are so many new characters that I will never forget and so many new transformations (including the one I think tops the first ever Super Saiyan Goku). The animation is at a level that I never thought it was even possible to achieve. The soundtrack is the main source of chills because once it starts ... Oh, it STARTS!

Obviously, Jiren is the main character that Goku and his team have to defeat, but there are so many other warriors that deliver colossal epic fights against the remaining characters. I guess the only flaw this arc has and the reason why it’s not absolutely perfect, it’s the overall story. Most characters don't really have a personality or a backstory, so this is purely an action-packed arc. The ending is predictable once we reach the final episodes, but I repeat what I said at the beginning of this review ... This is Dragon Ball, not an award-winning show for Best Screenplay.


I love everything about this arc and I honestly don't know what else to write to describe its epicness. Even with its minor issues, this is an A+. For what it intends to be, it’s far more than that and not a single flaw can overcome this achievement. I am going to read the manga version of it since it just started and wait for the next movie in December. Believe me when I say that this is not the end of the anime. It will continue in 2019/2020. At the end of it all, no one wants it to stop. It’s probably one of the few TV shows that rarely skipped a week (the animators’ schedule was one of the issues with the first couple of arcs) and that is something worth praising.

Conclusion

All in all, Dragon Ball Z might be better due to its impeccable balance between story and action. However, Dragon Ball Super will always be the saga that I will never forget. The epicness surrounding the characters, the beautifully choreographed fight scenes, the jaw-dropping animation quality and the chills induced by the amazing score ... It‘s so freaking awesome! It’s a fact that it took a while to get to the level the show presented in the last arc. The first couple of “seasons” are really painful, but the cinematic alternatives are a great way to partially skip the first 30 episodes or so. From the third arc on, it’s an adventure that I will cherish for a long, long time. Super's fillers rarely feel like such and the series' attempts at comedy are actually pretty funny.

Truthfully, I love this show. If I was only reviewing the last two arcs, the whole series would get an A+, but I have to be fair. If I had to go through the first arcs again knowing that I would get this outstanding payoff in the end, I would do it. Dragon Ball Super will live in my memory for eternity. Thank you to all of the animators for their exceptional work. Thank you for making me wish for Sunday to arrive every week, as quick as possible. Time to go through the ""my life is pointless"" phase ...

Until next time!

About creative process, it must involve gathering or meeting certain standards at any point given of the chain of production.

Arcane is not about clichés, although injustice, discrimination, ambition, love and hate, being universals of human nature, are, at the same time, in and out the category of ordinary repetition, plagiarism or lack of insight.
There is nothing ordinary about Arcane.
All of it is flawless, touching, remaking the animated fiction, between sci-fi and fantasy, as in life,to the next level of realization.
Like, after jumps like The Matrix or Inception, Alita Battle Angel showed the power of animation, maybe a transversal frontier that is leveling up the entire human culture, from 2D animation to virtual and augmented reality, this is about the new ""real"" around entertainment and creative industry.
Whoever cannot see and feel the smell of the Tempest blowing is in lack of common sense. 
Arcane, like many coming from and to the game entertainment industry, a masterpiece, is a truly beautiful thing. 
It's is not about the script, of good quality, nor about soundtrack or character's animation.

Maybe this should be classified a number above. 
From Japan, US, EU, China, Canada or Korea, there's a new player in town. 
Time must pass to understand the reshaping process the creative human experience is passing through.

In the case of Bleach, it was justifiable and were I younger, it definitely would've been that good. You see, the main character is a teenager who discovers that his ability to see spirits can allow him to battle transformed and evil ones too.

Since the main character is a teenager, he does a lot of what teenagers do. He's impulsive and lacks foresight, somewhat arrogant,  doesn't admit fault easily or gets in over his head pretty often.  
Sometimes, his mistakes are very repetitive and seem to be a device plot.

Talking about device plots, this series has fillers and a good load of them too. If you aren't into that, then look for the filler list and skip them.  
Additionally, what this sorely lacks is a version with all the flashbacks, intros, outros and fillers cut out similar to what Dragon Ball Kai did.

Aside from that, the world is well described, the lore interesting and the characters well developed. One is able to understand their intentions and motivations (even though they often boil down to the basic 6 ""sins"" wrath, envy, etc.)

Having watched all the episodes, I can confidently say that this series is a 10 out of 10 for me, and I eagerly await the arrival of season 5.

The story of ""Overlord"" revolves around Momonga, a powerful player who gets trapped in the virtual reality game Yggdrasil after its servers shut down. Taking on the persona of his in-game character, the powerful and enigmatic overlord Ainz Ooal Gown, he sets out to uncover the mysteries of this new reality and establish his dominance.

One of the standout features of ""Overlord"" is its complex and engaging storyline. The plot is rich with intrigue, strategic battles, and a well-developed world that keeps you hooked. Each episode builds upon the last, maintaining a perfect balance of action, suspense, and character development.

Speaking of characters, ""Overlord"" boasts an impressive and diverse cast, each with unique abilities and personalities. However, one character that stands out for me is Albedo. Her loyalty and devotion to Ainz, coupled with her fierce and captivating personality, make her a truly memorable character. Albedo's interactions with Ainz are some of the highlights of the series, adding depth and emotional weight to the story.

The animation quality in ""Overlord"" is top-notch, with fluid action sequences and detailed character designs that bring the world of Yggdrasil to life. The voice acting is also exceptional, with each actor perfectly embodying their character, enhancing the overall experience.

In conclusion, ""Overlord"" is a must-watch for any anime fan, especially those who enjoy Isekai stories. With its engaging plot, well-developed characters, and high-quality animation, it stands out as one of the best in its genre. I can't wait for season 5 to see where the story takes us next and to enjoy more of Albedo's captivating presence.

There's nothing terribly original by now about the plot of Tulsa King. Its  Mafia style antics are noting new. I think it was a smart move, playing this as a dark comedy. It fits the well worn character, Stallone, inhabits. 

That said, I guess the key question is, is it entertaining? I'd say ""sort of"". I like seeing Stallone back on the small screen. Regrettably, thus far and I appreciate its early days, the story is a little basic. Even for a comedy, it stretches credulity at times and lacks an intelligent wit and charm, that would have rendered it, more appealing.

849,The Uncanny Counter,"Drama, Mystery, Action & Adventure",8.348,"**_Deserving of high praises and top rating_**

""The Uncanny Counter"" (2020) Season 1 was a live-action adaptation of the webtoon (""digital Korean manhwa"") entitled ""Kyeongirowoon Somoon"" (2018) by Jang Yi. It stars Jo Byung Kyoo, Yoo Joon Sang, Kim Se Jeong, and Yeom Hye Ran, as the Counters--people who hunts evil spirits.

The multiple story arcs were well thought out and I was amazed with how these different stories perfectly fit together in the end which brought out the best in the characters and the moral lessons of the series. The casting and acting for the four lead characters were so good it was as the audience witnessed a true story.

The music, overall production, editing, and directing, were all superb. The choreography in the fight scenes were not lacking and were not overdone, simply fitting for four ordinary individuals to do; otherwise it would have been unrealistic.

Finally, and it is rare to see this in most Asian dramas, they ended the series properly leaving an option for a sequel or a new season. Stories should not be sealed--leaving no room for the audience to create their own continuation, which in turn also leaves no room for an official sequel.

Since it was already announced that season 2 was given a green light, it further proved the importance of ending a series with room for the future. Well done.

849,The Uncanny Counter,"Drama, Mystery, Action & Adventure",8.348,"The Uncanny Counter never really makes the most of its compelling premise. 

Perhaps, the biggest downside, is this series can be effusively emotional and syrupy, to the point of cringe worthiness. It also feels overly long. By the time episode 10 has been reached, it becomes repetitious.

That said, there is enough depth and intrigue to make this series moderately watchable. Its akin to a mash up of Western series like Supernatural, mixed with elements of Ghost Busters. Actions well done too and the back story is reasonably compelling.

The first few seasons are, for the most part, extremely fantastic, focused, funny, fresh, intelligent and even at times, brilliant. Most importantly, it offers something that separates it from the pack...Must see TV!

**What this review sounds like now nearing the end of the shows run.**

A once great show which slowly starts to diminish around season 4, unfortunately. By the 9th season it seems as though the pen and paper have been handed over to teenage fans of the show...Decent background noise.

**To conclude.**

This show was once incredible, and something fresh, even at times brilliant. I couldn't wait for each new episode. Now, I watch it when it becomes available on a streaming service, and, on rare occasion you get a great episode, but it's not worth devoting a weekly schedule and sitting through all the fan-fiction episodes and story lines to get to the good stuff. The show can still be enjoyable, without question, though I find it better suited as background noise while doing work instead of must see TV that you're excited to tune in as it airs each week. It's now just another average sitcom which has been dumbed down for the masses quite considerably. At this rate, the show will probably end with Penny having Sheldon's child to fulfill the most commonly seen teenage fan-fiction.","Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar","* * review might sound like write 7 years ago . * * first season , part , extremely fantastic , focus , funny , fresh , intelligent even time , brilliant . importantly , offer something separate pack ... must see tv ! * * review sound like near end show run . * * great show slowly start diminish around season 4 , unfortunately . 9th season seem though pen paper hand teenage fan show ... decent background noise . * * conclude . * * show incredible , something fresh , even time brilliant . could n't wait new episode . , watch become available stream service , , rare occasion get great episode , 's worth devote weekly schedule sit fan-fiction episodes story line get good stuff . show still enjoyable , without question , though find better suit background noise work instead must see tv 're excite tune air week .

I don’t agree with another review I saw that said the show had slipped over time. Rather, it is a consistently great show, as all of Chuck Lorre’s efforts seem to be, sort of comedy’s answer to Aaron Sorkin’s dramas.

Mind you, I had some minor issues with it. I really got tired of Sheldon’s attitude and antics, but that 2as counterbalanced by the slow and careful ways he also showed character growth. Similarly, all of the characters exhibited realistic growth in their attitudes and behavior. The writing was usually strong, even during the few shows that I would classify as clunkers— plots that didn’t work for me. I am impressed that the show never jumped the shark, but rather stayed true to itself. Some long running shows can’t resist doing it, such as when Happy Days changed the Fonz from a cool dude to a combo superhero/cartoon character who could do almost anything, it seemed.

942,Gilmore Girls,"Comedy, Drama",7.88,"This is a good show. My wife watched the entire set of series without me as it seemed we already had a lot to watch together. She enjoyed it and at some point I decided to watch it and she elected to watch it again with me. 

It is very witty and intelligent and, if you don’t mind every episode using the same wit and rapid fire word association and social references on and on, it is great fun. Once in a while they take it a bit too far and a character who has not shown great wit and humor comes out with a jewel. I can understand the writers wouldn’t want to waste the line.

They have two Sam and Diane characters (Lorelai and Luke) as a “will they or won’t they” romance — you know, from the tv show Cheers where they bend every script to bring them close to a romance, but oh, not quite. A lot of shows have done it since then (and probably before also. I mean they kept Mary Tyler Moore single as Mary Richards because she had dome the housewife thing in the Dick Van Dyke Show).

The show does really well at staying consistent, especially considering how many episodes there were each season. So even when it wears a bit thin for me, (for example, the Kurt character really gets old for me as they seem to have him do absolutely everything a minor guess character could do better. Did they not want to pay character actors?) it is still better than most shows out there. 

I feel I should add that I usually wait until I have watched the entire run of a show before reviewing it, because sometimes even good programs deteriorate or jump the shark. You know, when  show does something totally out of character or unbelievable to boost ratings or juice it up. Apparently the term came from the long-running Happy Days when the Fonz was water skiing and literally jumped over a shark. He almost took on super powers, it seemed.

Yes, there are many flaws. The acting of the supporting cast is not very strong, the storyline is a bit obvious, and sometimes things happen too conveniently for the story to progress.

But the good things certainly dominate the bad things. The ""Dunkirk approach"" to the editing mostly worked well, even though ambiguity remained at certain places. I guess those will be cleared in the second season. Henry Cavill was magnificent as the titular character. The dialogues were very strong too, thanks to its source material.

950,The Witcher,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Action & Adventure",8.0,"I originally watched this in 2019 when it released and was a big fan,
 the world was captivating and interesting yet bleak and grounded. Such 
was my interest, I shortly after played all the games and began reading 
the books, now two years later and with season 2 about to come out I 
decided it was worth a rewatch. 



On my second watch I wasn't quite as impressed, now able to judge the
 show both as an adaptation of material, characters and stories I was 
familiar with from other works and also able to better analyse the show 
as a piece of television in its own right now that I could better 
understand the  quite convoluted plot and timeline. 



The Show is an attempt to adapt two collections of short stories that
 serve as precursors to the main witcher series, these stories are often
 only loosely connected although are often thematically related and take
 place over a huge span of time and place.

This could lend itself nicely to an anthology style monster of the week collection with common themes, characters and world building however the The show ambitiously tries to construct a cohesive narrative out of this in 8 episodes and it doesn't really quite work, limited to only 8 episodes so much subtlety and intricacy is lost and that which is there, is often poorly explained. I  blamed myself on my initial watch for often being confused at what was 
happening but now after watching again while familiar with the source 
material I don't feel the show really does a good job of setting up the 
political background and bounces from one extreme to another either name
 dumping with no context or flanderization such as Nilfgaard = Nazis.



I would never expect a Movie or Tv show to be able to capture or 
match everything from a book series where the only limit is the readers 
imagination but was very surprised how I much preferred nearly all the 
voice acting and  visual aesthetics of the video games compared to the 
show, from the creature design to the Nilfgaardian armour to the sense 
of character I think the games does it all better. The acting here 
overall isn't great, although I do like Cavil as Geralt.

enjoy it  and hopefully pretends better to come but can't say it

But season 2 hurts. The writers of the show are rewriting the story unnecessarily, and it turns out much worse than the original material. Except for episode 1, the writers of this show simply do not understand what makes The Witcher world interesting. The Deathless Mother is boring, the brief glimpse of the Wild Hunt is boring and out of a million creepy and original monsters, the series finale has them fighting a bunch of velociraptors, because this is apparently Jurassic Park.

And while Henry Cavill isn't doing so great in the role of Geralt, I can hardly blame him, considering the bad dialogue writing overall. Freya Allan as Ciri is the best thing in this series. And to think that they almost didn&#39;t cast her just shows how out of touch the producers of this show are.

_The Witcher_ has consistently delivered a spellbinding experience across its three seasons, effectively introducing a credible and realistic fantasy world where the lines between good and bad are often blurred. The series masterfully brings to life the rich characters, sharp wit, and stylish action that fans of the novels and games have come to love.

From the very beginning, the production design stands out, with a commitment to creating an atmosphere steeped in medieval fantasy. The music enhances this immersion, wrapping you in a world that feels both ancient and alive. The actors, particularly Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, fully commit to their roles, embodying their characters with a depth and authenticity that is rare in fantasy television.

Season one lays a strong foundation with its non-linear narrative, offering an exciting, intoxicating, and at times, downright confusing ride that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. As the series progresses, it continues to balance action, drama, humor, and the darker aspects of its world-such as sex and monsters-creating a rich tapestry of storytelling that is both fun and engaging.

By the time we reach Geralt and Ciri's latest outing, the series has evolved into a spectacular odyssey of family and destiny. Set within a world brimming with history and political schemes, their journey is as much about the bonds they forge as it is about the epic battles they fight.

_The Witcher_ remains a must-watch for fans of the genre, offering something for everyone, whether you're drawn to its intense action scenes, its deeply human characters, or its richly detailed world.

963,Agatha Christie'S Poirot,"Crime, Drama, Mystery",8.145,"Thank you LWT (London Weekend Television) and (eventually) ITV Studios for offering this magnificent television expédition! Poirot, brilliantly portrayed by Sir David Suchet is one of the best television shows in the world, ever! Even Agatha Christie's books are not as good as the writing in this show (thank you Poirot writers!). You haven't been gobsmacked until you've seen this elegant, suspenseful, well-written, and well-acted marvel!

Art Deco became appealing because of this television's well design elegant sets. The soundtrack naturally complements the refined, stylish and nostalgic approach to murder mysteries that Poirot exhibits. The acting of the cast is incredible! The friendships of Poirot are gassers! There is the comically brazen off the cob bazoo, Inspector Chief Japp (Jackson). There is the attractive and fun timidity of our piece of cake, Captain Hastings (Fraser). I especially like the dedicated, organized, and caring tomato, Miss Lemon (Moran). Lastly, there is the hilarious Abercrombie whiz , our Ariadne Oliver (Wanamaker). They hold respect for one another; fret together through the maze and horror of murder; can still laugh; and never forget to recognize and value the nice in this world. Their working relationships and persinal friendships are a model for all.

Sir David Suchet is the best Hercule Poirot, a butter and egg man! His acting is as impeccable as M. Poirot's criminal detection. Mr. Suchet is so good being M. Poirot --- which he did for around (25) twenty-five years --- that it is hard to believe that he isn't really the world's greatest detective from Belgium (please remember, for Poirot's sake, that he is not French). The way Mr. Suchet walks; meticulously cares for his moustache; experiences the dirtiness in the world with the same disgust and need to clean as the rest of us; insists on the best of everything, as a consumer (like the rest of us); and dances with his little gray cells is amazingly real!

1017,The Last Kingdom,"Action & Adventure, Drama, War & Politics",8.3,"Pleasantly surprised by the first episode *Spoilers*

As a fan of Cornwell's Warrior Chronicles/Saxon Stories I've been looking forward to this series for quite some time. Mentally prepared for a major disappointment I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.

If you haven't read the novels the story of Uhtred unfolds fast, perhaps too fast. This first episode covers more than half of the first novel. Although a lot has been omitted, many of the aspects that make the novel such a pleasure to read are there, but (very) subtle. 
If you have read the novel you have to accept that many events concerning Uhtred of Bebbanburg and his character traits are only touched upon or skipped: his loathing for his father, his fascination for the religion of his forefathers, his contempt (or rather boredom) for Christianity, the stories the blacksmith tells him, Beocca's attempts to teach him to read, his first encounter with an adulterous Alfred (the not so Great yet), his admiration for the Romans, his growing love for Ragnar and Ragnar's family, his arrogance and big mouth, his humor and much more. I would have loved to have been able to watch at least four episodes in which of all of the above is featured but that is not going to happen.

Then why did I like it so much?
I have to admit I'm a sucker for guys with long hair and pretty faces, but besides that, the episode had enough to offer: Uhtred's Christian/Saxon upbringing and his pagan beliefs are represented by his two necklaces: the amber stone and Thor's hammer. I hope Uhtred's internal struggle will be featured more prominently in the episodes to come. A baptism scene in which Beocca could easily have drowned Uhtred making an end to the series after only half an episode. Young Uhtred is a smart-mouthed little brat (like when he is trying to get his way with Beocca). Young as he is, he is the ealdorman of Bebbanburg and is willing to die for it. He is doesn't think first but acts, and so we see a child going to war and attacking a Danish warlord. We are treated to the sight of a massive shield-wall in which it becomes clear that there is almost no space to move and that movement is slow. If you die, you become an obstacle that your fellow comrade-in-arms have to be beware of or else they will fall too. (Even after two viewings still a bit surprised that Lord Uhtred (Matthew MacFadyen) stepped through the shield-wall so easily. I must have missed the Danes letting him through.) Thyra is mentally broken after the awful hall-burning, and not just by Sven. Could Uhtred have saved her? It seems Thyra expected him to. Ubba, though a great Danish leader, and despite having humor, is very cautious and heavily depends on the signs the gods send him, making him very unpredictable, according to Ravn, earl Raganar's father. Brida is portrayed as a strong young woman, more Dane than Saxon. But above all, I liked Uhtred. I liked the way he looks and moves. I did miss his humor but I have hopes that we will be treated to that in the next episodes. He was powerless during the hall-burning, and devastated by the deaths of Ragnar and his family. For now, he is still a boy. Can't wait for him to become a man.

1017,The Last Kingdom,"Action & Adventure, Drama, War & Politics",8.3,"**Great, but could be better and decreases in quality in season 4.**

I am writing this review after having watched season 4. I have binge watched this TV show and loved it overall, but I was disappointed of how the show decreased in quality in season 4.

One reason for that decline might be that the former showrunner and head writer Stephen Butchard quit as the head writer after season 3. Another one might be that a central character of the seasons 1-3 died at the end of season 3 - resulting in a major shift for all the other characters and especially for the main protagonist of the show.

Another reason for the decrease in quality seems to be that it becomes more unrealistic, inconsistent and carricaturistic in season 4 than it already was to some extent in the seasons before.

To give some examples: I simply hate it when stupid stuff is presented, like kings (or even queens) unnecessarily throwing themselves into the frontlines of battles and thus stupidly (and out of character) putting the whole kindgom under unnecessary risk (as it is very destabilizing for a kindom when a king unexpectedly dies and finding a good successor who is capable of keeping peace and order is difficult and takes time). It may be important if the king is present at the battlefield, but it's ridiculous when they are fighting in the frontlines, they are too valuable to do such things and when they do, it should mean something and not just happen on a regular basis. Especially, since it is established in the show that sudden death in the battlefield frontlines is a likely thing to happen even for the most capable fighters.

Or, I hate it when characters do stupid stunts which would get them killed in no time in real life (like running through a shield wall alone and then finding themselves fighting alone surrounded by enemies). I don't mind in general when characters do stunts like that, but it should be consistent in terms of world-building and it should be explained how the characters can do such things without wearing plot armor and for example without enemy fighters who are surrounding them just standing there, doing nothing and just waiting for their turn to be attacked for no good reason.

So, it has always been a problem in the show that such stupid stuff happens. But season 4 took that to a new level and I hated it. Especially when we are looking at the character of Brida for example - she is transformed into an inhuman monstrocity regarding her capabilities and her motivations, therefore I can't take anything that happens with her seriously anymore.

This review is more a rant about season 4 than it is a balanced and complete review of the whole show. So let let me give an overall review with this short summary: it is or at least was a great show and seasons 1-3 would deserve to rightfully be given 8 or 9 stars out of 10, but right now after season 4 it is just a 7/10. The show is still good and it has the advantage that it is based on an already finished book series of 13 titles (2 book titles resulting in 1 season each, so there are probably 3 or 4 seasons more to come if the show remains successful) - so that it probably won't get much worse than season 4 as the new authors don't have to come up with a plot from scratch and thus will be able to hold some level of quality thanks to the already existing books. But I really hope that it gets better than that again, just as it was in seasons 1-3.","Alexander Dreymon, Emily Cox, Eliza Butterworth, Mark Rowley, Ruby Hartley","* * great , could better decrease quality season 4 . * * write review watch season 4. binge watch tv show love overall , disappoint show decrease quality season 4. one reason decline might former showrunner head writer stephen butchard quit head writer season 3. another one might central character season 1-3 die end season 3 - result major shift character especially main protagonist show . another reason decrease quality seem become unrealistic , inconsistent carricaturistic season 4 already extent season . give examples : simply hate stupid stuff present , like kings ( even queen ) unnecessarily throw frontlines battle thus stupidly ( character ) put whole kindgom unnecessary risk ( destabilize kindom king unexpectedly die find good successor capable keep peace order difficult take time ) . may important king present battlefield , 's ridiculous fight frontlines , valuable things , mean something happen regular basis . especially , since establish show sudden death battlefield frontlines likely thing happen even capable fighters . , hate character stupid stunt would get kill time real life ( like run shield wall alone find fight alone surround enemies ) . n't mind general character stunt like , consistent term world-building explain character things without wear plot armor example without enemy fighters surround stand , nothing wait turn attack good reason . , always problem show stupid stuff happen . season 4 take new level hat . especially look character brida example - transform inhuman monstrocity regard capabilities motivations , therefore ca n't take anything happen seriously anymore . review rant season 4 balance complete review whole show . let let give overall review short summary : least great show season 1-3 would deserve rightfully give 8 9 star 10 , right season 4 7/10 . show still good advantage base already finish book series 13 title ( 2 book title result 1 season , probably 3 4 season come show remain successful ) - probably wo n't get much worse season 4 new author n't come plot scratch thus able hold level quality thank already exist book . really hope get better , season 1-3 .",-1,-1

1034,The Great Queen Seondeok,"Drama, Desconocido",7.2,"It would have been such a good show if they packaged it into 30 episodes. They had two subplots about Hwarang side quests that were a total waste of time, they paused the main story for them. While they might have served a small tiny purpose but the drama could've accomplished that without these easily. I read somewhere that the drama was extended from 50 to 62 episodes and I can't help but wonder if there was a direct correlation between extending the drama and introducing the character Kim Chun Chu at episode 36. Because both decisions were worse than one another. What made me more suspicious that this was the case was because it felt like someone has pushed the soft reset button on the story as a whole around episode 36 and everything took a big step backward. At this exact point I was about to mentally check out. Prior to episode 36, they had this Hwarang competition which was already the weakest checkpoint at this point so what came after only made things worse. Fast forward to the last chunk of episodes, all events post Lady Mi Shil involvement were clearly an unplanned afterthought which led to an underwhelming final climax. The is exactly at the extension gap between 50-62. Away from the poor pacing, the characters showed promise until they stopped. Guess what? It happened also after episode 36, the female lead who used to be a character full of characterization became a soulless blank of wood, boring, bland and dumb. There were many other examples of characters who went through the same downgraded transformation around the cursed episode 36. 

The story had one major point of disconnect that the writer blatantly swept under the rug, it single-handedly broke the story apart. The female lead came from a hermit living in the woods into her position of power immediately without any regard to any other factors concerning anything. The only justification we were given is that she read books while growing up and was raised in the streets. Her parents had no role in the process despite being the king and queen, not even for emotional support. All I see is just poor storytelling. The background music mixing was trash. Every scene started with low-ish background music, got progressively louder and became unbearably loud and intense until the scene is cut. Repeat this 20 times every episode and endure the nausea. Around midway through I was thinking this is a good 7/10 drama despite the Hwarang nonsense but it turns out that this drama was the perfect example of a drama having a good 1st half and fumbling the 2nd half so hard.

The show is 99% fish-out-of-water story of a feisty modern (well, from 1945 anyway) Englishwoman nurse , Claire Randall (played by Caitriona Balfe), who is sent back to 18th century Scotland by some mumbo-jumbo druidic magic after touching a runestone.  The theme is _heavy_ on a Harlequin-esque romance between the two leads, Claire and Jamie Fraser (played by Sam Heughan).  There's some fighting, almost as much boobies as Game of Thrones, and gore that may keep the guys interested, but this show is mostly going to appeal to women I think.

(This may be a spoiler, but there is also a FAR too long drawn-out guy-on-guy homoerotic torture arc that I really hated.  And, aside from the lead, a lot of the men depicted are pretty horrible.)

I think the historical costume-drama aspect of it is pretty interesting, I know a fair amount more about 18th century Scotland than I used to (which was pretty much nothing).  So, if you like that kind of stuff, you might like this.  Honestly though, I think having a POV of a modern woman kind of muddles the historical aspect a bit.  I liked Downton Abbey better if that helps (yes I know, different time period, but I think handled the period piece costume drama aspect better, even with all the soap opera tropes), so that may say something.","Caitríona Balfe, Sam Heughan, Richard Rankin, Sophie Skelton, John Bell","* * tl ; dr : 're interest watch show hear time travel , n't . * * 1 % show , least first season ( 's far 've get ) . even time travel aspect mystical , _no_ sci-fi element . _lost_ ai n't . change past season one , well , guess might enjoy , 's primary reason give show go , wife enjoy lot . ca n't get enough . , 's pretty meh , warn guy proper review . show 99 % fish-out-of-water story feisty modern ( well , 1945 anyway ) englishwoman nurse , claire randall ( play caitriona balfe ) , send back 18th century scotland mumbo-jumbo druidic magic touch runestone . theme _heavy_ harlequin-esque romance two lead , claire jamie fraser ( play sam heughan ) .

1084,Twin Peaks,"Drama, Mystery",8.3,"Twin Peaks delivers everything. It's a television show that delivers mystery, drama, comedy, suspense and weirdness in a way that only a handful of television programs have done. It might be the most effective 'mainstream' David Lynch vehicle of all time. The story is based in an alternate reality that parodies classic daytime soap-operas that had been popular during the nineteen-eighties. But it doesn't really parody them. More, it pays homage. The stereotypical characters mimic the same beats of actors appearing in shows like _Days of Our Lives_ or _As the World Turns_. 

David Lynch and Mark Frost show that they are masters of manipulating the emotions of the audience. _Twin Peaks_ delivers supernatural storylines and plot-devices with a flair that leaves the viewer confused and uncomfortable. It elicits feelings from its spectators. This is the mark of good quality media. It's what makes _Twin Peaks_ one of my favorite programs. 

The characters are identifiable, intriguing and unforgettable. One of the biggest draws to Twin Peaks is their character development. This isn't just a story about a girl that is killed and wrapped in plastic. No. This is a collection of various stories that weave around one and other. From our friend Sheriff Harry Truman and his relationship to Josie. To the adventures of Audrey Horn, Super Sleuth. To the exploits of Bobby, Shelly and the comatose Leo Johnson.

But the most unforgettable character is our central one. The hero, FBI Agent Dale Cooper. A role perfectly played by Kyle MacLachlan. He also happens to the the main character. The focus. Agent Cooper has been assigned to the Laura Palmer murder case in the small town of Twin Peaks. His introduction to the town mimics our own in an strangely positive light. This makes Agent Cooper a perfect host to an otherwise depressing feature. His uplifting nature is infectious not only to the story but also to the audience. I can also identify with his notorious love of Cherry Pie and Coffee. 

To say that the storyline meanders is a bit of an understatement. The overarching story is about a small-town girl that was murdered by an unknown killer. The FBI had been brought in to investigate, but that is where things go awry. We get Aliens, Logs, Supernatural Events, Possessions, Incest, Betrayal, Physical Transformations, Teleportation, Alternate Realities and The Yakuza all presented in a bizarre way that still leaves you wanting more. To make things even more enticing. I like to think of this world not only being expanded out into the Revival show on Showtime (2017) or the film, _Fire Walk With Me_ but also an extension of Lynch's film _Lost Highway_.

The weirdness is what makes Twin Peaks so memorable. When David Lynch is involved, it's not just frivolous silliness. Everything is a metaphor. For the most part. I think. Maybe. This weirdness carries the show into some really dark and scary places. That again is something that makes the series so gripping.

If you're a fan of David Lynch's work then this is perfect for you. If you're a film student. If you're a fan of gripping television. Watch _Twin Peaks_! It gets weird, but that's just par for course. Some people have criticized the show for going too far off the rails. It had been viewed as boring too. But its a show for people that really want to sit down and enjoy something. It's not a Michael Bay produced explosion picture and that might turn off a good deal of typical viewers.

The setting is this:

There's Earth, whose government is torn with some seeking to control or best the government of Mars and the emerging government of the Belt.

About the books: Yes, they are fantastic. The show is also fantastic. It's okay to like both even if they aren't the same.

A note on other reviews here: I'm surprised by all of the negativity in the other reviews considering how overwhelmingly positive the show has been received and reviewed on other sites. As Beltalowda say, Xetamang tili du xeta.

I'm going to be intentionally vague here:
There are several elements at play in the show. One arc of the first season focuses on the mystery of a missing person and a detective's journey finding out what happened to her. The second focuses on who's responsible for a ship that was destroyed. A third focuses on a dangerous and valuable substance that was found, and a fourth that focuses on the political climate of the solar system while certain events trigger tension between Earth, Mars, and The Belt. 

The first and second mysteries are solved in the first season, but the rest evolve and grow throughout the rest of the series. The series has a diverse cast of strong characters without resorting to the usual lazy denigration that other series' and movies have latched onto lately. There's just enough attention to scientific detail to make the show feel grounded (thrusters on the back of turrets to counter rotation while firing), while still leaving enough to the imagination to be awe inspiring. There's a depth to The Expanse's universe that is intoxicating.

The Belter Creole language made by a linguist that you can actually learn on memrise (yes, really) illustrates this perfectly.

It is not! Truly this would have been the end the show deserved had this been the final episode.

Apparently it was written as such until the show was renewed BUT with most of the cast moving on contractually already! Yes, a wrap around\ tag on scene\tale opens the show up to an all new reset of the beginning, only with a now adult Henry being approached by his unknown to him daughter (about the same age Henry was when he found Emma in ep 1 season 1)! She says he must go with her cause ""his family needs him"". Sound familiar? It would seem Henry, like Emma in that ep, is clueless and so another forgetting spell was cast. Or whatever!

For those who do not know, the next season will no longer have the following characters\actors: Emma Swan, Snow White, Prince Charming, Belle, young Henry, and I am sure I am forgetting one other. The core will be the now adult Henry, Hook, Gold, and the evil queen\not evil anymore.

How the show intends to carry on or explain where everyone missing has gone (yes there was a time jump in the tag on scene of several years) will be interesting to see, but I frankly have little hope for the continued success of the show.

**SEASON 01:****

I was not sure to give it a try, in the end I just went on. The reason was, another dystopian theme. It was a short season with the 10 episodes, and I've got a mixed feeling. It was based on the 30 year old novel of the same name. I mean 3 decades old source is very old in the present trend. Since that book there were plenty of films, series were made similar to that theme, including one feature film adaptation. I don't know the screenplay was highly borrowed from its original source, but all I expected was alterable.

Even though I felt familiarity, I enjoyed watching it. My issue was the drag. The whole season was a drag. Dragged to have one more season, or maybe more in the future. Especially I was very disappointed with the season finale. It only felt like a mid-season finale and yet a lot more to come in the same season. But that was only my assumption, this season ended at the halfway. They had held back too much to have some of it in the upcoming seasons. That's very intense move from the production perspective, but for the viewers, it left with unsatisfying.

The plus points were the casting and production. Elisabeth Moss was very good. Her expressions saved in parts of the earlier episodes. Particularly, her smile during those circus were going on, instead of being tensed and confused. That reveals the character, who wants to stay alive for a reason. As the story progresses in the next episodes, you would know more reasons why. Alexis' part was short, as well as many others. The overall the characters design was good. But I anticipated more from the story side to reveal.

In the near future, the humans had lost fertility capacity, excluding a very few men and women. Those who are capable of having babies are taken as slave surrogate mothers, after separating from their husbands and kids, to assign them those who desire to have children. This tale follows Offred, who is one of the maids. Her struggle against the couple who took her in, and overall society, how it treated her and others like her. The American dreams are gone. Many fled to Canada and yet some are trying to make it there. But Offred is not concerned about that. She now has to find her daughter before planning anything.

Each epidoe was decent, but only a couple of them were top class. At least now we know what to expect from the follow-up season. Also the perspective of the story was very restricted like everything was from Offred. The episode like 'The Other Side' really made it interesting. We need more those kind of explanation of what's going on on the other side. Especially for a television series, they have all the time to detail out from all the angle. That's what I like in the series, otherwise I'm always a film fanatic, love to watch short and sweet tales. So I'm waiting for the season 2.

1150,The Handmaid'S Tale,"Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.2,"Every now and then a production comes along that such an absolute gem, it has you lost for words.

A Handmaids Tale, is based on the novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood . I have not yet read the book but if this series is anything to go by, it will, I'm sure, make its way into my collection very soon.

On the surface the premise behind the series seems novel. Yet when you consider the fate of women in contemporary and historic theocratic societies, its not so far fetched. Indeed, what Atwood has rather cleverly done, is transplant aspects of life in theocratic societies, most notably Medieval Europe and Puritan colonial America, into a futuristic setting using civil war as a vehicle. A biological imperative is introduced too, in the form of pollution induced human sterility. Fertile women in Gilead (formerly the USA) are reduced to human incubators, their only imperative to produce children.

On face value, this might seem to be a story about the subjugation and commoditization of women. Indeed, it is that. Yet, what this series is ultimately about is the hypocrisy of intolerance. Not just women but any individual or group, who diverge from the rigid religious script, meet a grim fate. Meanwhile, those controlling the dialogue, are more or less free to make and break their own rules, as they see fit. Even those who do follow the societal script, often do so for reasons that are in opposition to those they claim to uphold.

For my money everything about this series is superb. Elizabeth Moss is a wonderful, off beat choice, for Offred the handmaid to a powerful commander, who is directly responsible for hers and others suffering. Joseph Fiennes, is capable in the role of the superficially charming but emotionally empty commander.

Update: Yes a decent series but, for my money, its run on too long and now simply appears to be recycling the original script with a few twists and turns. At times, in my opinion, perilously close to looking like misandry, too. 

In short, an engrossing, thoughtful and engaging series but it needs to come to a close, as it no longer has much more to say, that has not already been said.

It's the cheapest and lowliest insult to the medium and to any viewer. Therefore, this drama gets the stamp of shame for incorporating that once and attempting to do it another time later.

1208,New Amsterdam,Drama,8.4,"""New Amsterdam"" captivated me from the first episode, five years after its premiere. While the romantic subplots were enjoyable, I was truly drawn to the series' realistic portrayal of hospital life, the complexities of the medical profession, and the diverse tapestry of patient stories. As a social science enthusiast, I find myself fascinated by human interaction, analyzing how people react to situations and connect with each other. ""New Amsterdam"" provides a rich and engaging platform for this exploration, offering a glimpse into the intricate workings of society without the real-life pressures.

The series also serves as a fascinating case study in leadership. Max, the hospital director, embodies a cool, honest, and effective leadership style that I find particularly compelling. Watching him navigate the challenges of running a large, complex hospital provides valuable insights for anyone interested in leadership, including myself as a leadership facilitator.

The setting of New York City adds another layer of intrigue. The Big Apple, a melting pot of cultures and personalities, provides a vibrant backdrop for the series. We encounter a diverse range of characters, each with their own unique stories and struggles, reflecting the complexities of contemporary society. As an observer, I relish the opportunity to witness these interactions without personal involvement, a luxury that ""New Amsterdam"" provides.

While the first two seasons set a high bar for creativity and coherence, I noticed a slight decline in these aspects in subsequent seasons. Perhaps the creative team ran out of steam, or maybe it's just my perception. Regardless, the initial seasons remain a compelling and insightful exploration of human interaction, medical life, and leadership, making ""New Amsterdam"" a must-watch for anyone who shares my interests.","Ryan Eggold, Janet Montgomery, Jocko Sims, Tyler Labine, Sandra Mae Frank","`` new amsterdam '' captivate first episode , five years premiere . romantic subplots enjoyable , truly draw series ' realistic portrayal hospital life , complexities medical profession , diverse tapestry patient stories . social science enthusiast , find fascinate human interaction , analyze people react situations connect . `` new amsterdam '' provide rich engage platform exploration , offer glimpse intricate workings society without real-life pressure . series also serve fascinate case study leadership . max , hospital director , embody cool , honest , effective leadership style find particularly compel . watch navigate challenge run large , complex hospital provide valuable insights anyone interest leadership , include leadership facilitator . set new york city add another layer intrigue . big apple , melt pot culture personalities , provide vibrant backdrop series . encounter diverse range character , unique stories struggle , reflect complexities contemporary society . observer , relish opportunity witness interactions without personal involvement , luxury `` new amsterdam '' provide . first two season set high bar creativity coherence , notice slight decline aspects subsequent season . perhaps creative team run steam , maybe 's perception . regardless , initial season remain compel insightful exploration human interaction , medical life , leadership , make `` new amsterdam '' must-watch anyone share interest .",1,1

Actually this is very bad, but somehow they manage to let you skip everytime to the next episode. The overall idea is fine. I like time-travel films/series and this one is different enough than the rest. The acting varies between decent and very bad. The cheesy typical American pro-family vibe ruins it and is even worse than Lost in Space (2018). Nice are the prehistoric (late-Pleistocene) animals, which are quite correct. Although I doubt if those spiders were really that big (large Arthropods are usually found in warmer/tropical areas).

I can’t say we binge-watched it, because we watch tv during our meals mostly, so we never watched more than two in a sitting. But we did whip through the seasons fairly quickly.

There is a lot of tension and suspense involved. They have cases that go on for a moderator amount of time, but at least one that ranged for over a season. 

In some respects, Bosch is a typical police show detective. He is driven and stubborn, and pushes the line sometimes in what he does. He has an ex-wife, of course, but he doesn’t try to run her life or threaten her new love interests. Also, Bosch has a good relationship (mostly) with his daughter, and that is a good thing.

There are plenty of subplots around his superiors, other officers, or peripheral characters, and some of it works better than others. Politics runs through the show as well. For comic relief you have partners Crate and Barrel, which are not their real names. They don’t do a stand-up routine, but they are a tad eccentric and a nice change in mood for the show. They have their serious moments also.

As always with these type of shows, they blow their budget early on on flashy scenes then left wondering how to produce the rest. You may expect inconsistencies along the way, like having two or more camera angles of the same scene with different color grading and quality. I suppose an intern was editing that day.

1352,Virgin River,Drama,8.0,"""Virgin River"" isn't your typical high-octane drama. It's a gentle breeze in a world of hurricane-force narratives. While some might find its pace languid and its plot predictable, it's this very simplicity that makes it so captivating.

From the moment you step into the picturesque setting of Virgin River, nestled amidst breathtaking greenery and towering pines, you feel a sense of calm wash over you. It's the quintessential American small town, where everyone knows everyone and the pace of life is measured in sunshine and quiet evenings. This idyllic backdrop, coupled with the charming characters, creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere, making ""Virgin River"" the perfect escape from the frantic pace of modern life.

While the romance between Mel and Jack forms the core of the series, it's not the only thing that draws you in. The genuine community spirit, the heartwarming friendships, and the simple struggles of everyday life are beautifully depicted. The characters, with their flaws and vulnerabilities, feel like friends you've known for years.

Jack Sheridan, in particular, embodies the spirit of the series. He's the quintessential ""good guy,"" a hero who puts the needs of others before his own. It's incredibly satisfying to see him navigate life with empathy and courage, and his moments of vulnerability offer a poignant reminder that even the strongest have their struggles.

""Virgin River"" isn't a show for everyone. If you crave fast-paced action and complex plot twists, you might be disappointed. But for those seeking solace and a sense of connection, it's a breath of fresh air. It's a reminder that simple joys and genuine relationships are the true treasures in life.

So, if you're looking to escape the noise and immerse yourself in a world where kindness prevails and life moves at a slower pace, then ""Virgin River"" is waiting for you. Just be sure to pack your cozy blanket and a cup of hot cocoa, you're going to want to stay a while.","Alexandra Breckenridge, Martin Henderson, Colin Lawrence, Benjamin Hollingsworth, Lauren Hammersley","`` virgin river '' n't typical high-octane drama .

Years ago I watched ""The Corner"", which was like a prequel to The Wire, and it not only saddened me as to how people live and are dependent on drugs, but it also intrigued me. So much so that I went on to watch The Wire.

What I loved about the show is how it views the misery of drugs from different perspectives. In season 1 it focuses on the on-going battle between the street-corner dealers and the police; season 2 focuses on drug distribution; season 3 the possibility of a drug amnesty; season 4 and school kids and their choices between education, employment and drug dealers; season 5 the media take on drugs.

There is a certain feeling of helplessness running through this show, as you quickly realise that despite the extreme law enforcement the war on drugs is long gone. But because of the exceptionally good writing throughout you keep on hoping that something can be done to rid the city/state/country of this cancer.

And while I would recommend this show to any adult with a solid upbringing in education and common sense, it is for the total opposite end of those two traits I would recommend this show be cancelled. 

The social-liberal agenda underlying this show is without a doubt reprehensible.  The nudity, comedy, and hilarious writing cannot overshadow the concentrated subliminal indoctrination that are focal points in this series.  The formula here is the same that has been and is being used in most of animation for the last several years; that edict being, _**""Since it is 'make-believe' or 'a cartoon' it's okay to express same sex relationships, gender identity views/politics, and the manipulation of gender norms through them.  Just make with the comedy and everything else will be overlooked.""**_  (no, It won't)  
I do not know if these conditions are presented to the creator as mandatory by the company execs to get the show green-lit, or if these points are just expressions of the creator and his writing team; but the nefariousness of injecting these culturally minimal abnormal issues through a child's medium is downright socially treasonous.

* No, going between two homes of divorced parents is not great; it sucks.  The only positive is that they can't be shitty parents by arguing in front of you.
* NO!! PARENTS SHOULD BE PARENTS and make sure kids under 16 years old cannot watch this show!!!

Big Mouth is a marvelous show in its creation; the idea behind it is genius.  But some of the things mentioned above should not be available for just anyone to watch.  They are seriously not issues that a young mind can have perspective on and deduce comedic fun/license from viable reality.  Unfortunately people born after 1984, seem to be really, really, really...really shitty parents.  

I was not impressed with the lastest season of Big Mouth.  I especially didn't care for Maury being pregnant, Jay & Matthew's relationship, Jessi's gender assignment pronoun bullshit hang ups, Missy's black family being riddled with single-moms, gay daughters, and ""asexual"" old women, not to mention her father being a feministic ally (even though all that shit is accurate AF). I found last season's lovebug Walter being ""flamer-lite"" a bit patronizing.  And though black women do damn-near have a patent on Nasty Attitude & Bitterness, it too was a bit patronizing most of the lovebugs/Hate-worms were American afrocentric.  

Okay (whew!) Last time...If you can get past all of that, then this show is funny AF!!  Truly. There are some people, adult or teen, who can't watch this show and be entertained.

This is an example of a production company who liked the IDEA of the intellectual property, and had a complete disrespect and disdain for the CONTENT of the property. This felt nothing like Halo, and completely ignored the established franchise's history, lore, cannon, etc. Bad CGI, bad action sequences, and a completely underwhelming plot and actor performances.

1400,Halo,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Action & Adventure",8.279,"At first I had no hope for any series that would be spawned by 343 industries that had to do with Halo. In my opinion 343 industries was the downfall of the Halo series. When Bungie left Microsoft and gave Halo over to 343 industries, they turned the entire series into something that was just bland and unfeeling. As much as I loved Master Chief and playing as Master Chief, the heart of Halo died the moment Bungie turned the reins over to someone else.

So what I say that I had no hope for the series when it came to TV is saying the least and most decent way I can say that I knew it was going to be a steaming pile of shit.

Surprisingly though, the TV series really wasn't that bad. They skipped over some things, rushed a few things, and redefined a couple more but overall the series was as close to what Halo is that a TV series possibly could get.



Pablo Schreiber was a good choice for Master Chief. At first I couldn't get past the fact that I knew him as pornstash from Orange is the New Black. But after about the second episode I found myself feeling like he was more Master Chief than the master chief I knew in the game. The way he talked and carried himself throughout the entire series was the exact way Master Chief does throughout the entire game series. Even down to the way he held his gun, Pablo was perfect.

I particularly grew quite fond of Spartan 125 AKA Kai. From her pretty much picking up a warthog to taking on so many elites and standing up to the status quo, Kai was a badass.



Was a little disappointed in how they changed Commander Keyes and Miranda Keyes characters so much. Other than that the actors that they got to play both parts were very good. The actress that they got to play Halsey was tremendous and I am really pleased that they brought Jen back to voice Cortana.



The first Covenant you really see in this series is the elite. Now I think that their mouthpiece is a little smaller than what it is in the games but otherwise the elites looked brilliant.


Prophets they nailed those 100%.


And if you thought the Brutes were ugly in the game, wait till you see them in the TV show. And yes I still hate Brutes that much.


Jackels and grunts don't really make that make a huge appearance until the last episode but they were still done very well.


Sadly there's only one small scene with the hunters and basically all you see is their separate forms as worms and they are scattered and taking out all the Marines on a certain ship at Meekee's request.


If you Didn't know Halo lore, you wouldn't have recognized the hunters at all you probably would have just brushed over it but I recognized it and I was like ""hey those are the hunters"".

We only see the Halo ring when MeeKee or Master Chief are touching the artifacts and it's only for a brief moments but if that's what's to come in future episodes (if there are future episodes), then I think the HALO series is in good hands. Wait, Let me correct myself there... I think the Halo TV series is in good hands cuz 343 can fuck right off.

There's only one other thing I can say that I didn't like about the HALO series and that was the fact that Master Chief kind of went off character and lost his virginity as Cortana watched. That was something none of us needed to see. But not a lot of skin was shown in that scene so we'll give it a pass just because it wasn't an extra long sex scene that we didn't need.

Overall if you're a Halo fan, the TV series isn't that bad so give it a chance. We're not that far into the lore or the games so to speak that you couldn't see what you want to see from it .... there's so much more that's coming if they continue this series. We have Johnson to look forward to (hopefully), scarabs, the actual halo rings, the flood, and the forerunners. If they choose to continue the Halo TV series it could be huge.

This is a complete package of pure manufactured junk, offering no redeeming qualities whatsoever. A waste of carbon emissions as well. At a certain point, it became impossible to pick itself up from the hole it dug. The storyline was utterly unappealing, lacking any semblance of creativity or intrigue. The script itself was shoddily constructed, replete with contradictions and nonsensical elements. Every single plotline ended up being underdeveloped. The characterization was equally inadequate, with every single character exhibiting pitiful and distasteful traits. The relationships portrayed in the drama were nothing more than childish and insipid, particularly the abhorrent love triangle/square/pentagon at the center of it all.

1504,Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Comedy, Drama, Action & Adventure",8.1,"Wow. I mean it unfortunately came out in 97 and ended in '03 which was really the worst possible time for me. That was going to HS and working full time to save for college and then going to college and working two jobs to avoid debt time.

So when it came out I was vaguely aware of it and some people who's opinions on things like this I still trust absolutely loved it... and some actually hated it. Which to me made it a controversial must see for me... but 97-03 was just not the time.

I didn't get to watch it until life calmed down a bit and that was around '09. And, of course, by then NO ONE wanted to talk about i and everyone had moved on to other shows. So I was left in my own Buffy Bubble and it became a sort of private love affair.

So... what you have here is a television series based on B-Movie tropes that then turns them upside down in a way that you will absolutely love... if you love B-Movies and all their tropes.

The cast is across the board hysterical. It's not really a comedy, but you're going to at least chuckle in every episode.

And the pretty blond ditz that dies in every B horror movie is the kick-butt savior. Which is problematic in 2020 because you aren't supposed to acknowledge that women were ever portrayed as heroic before 2016, and, as a result, any mention of this will get you the N , M, and F word labels by people want to say that they are fighting for equality and thus Buffy doesn't fit in their timelines....

... so even today it's controversial... but this time it is controversial by the people that SHOULD like it... because it was made before 2016 so they don't.

Point being, it is awesome from start to finish... I'm one of the freaks that didn't take any issue with Dawn...and if you have one of the better teachers you are going to learn all about how it forever changed the English language... so there you go, if the title is the reason you don't like it, you got that academia link.

1510,Wednesday,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery, Comedy",8.439,"Wednesday's plot focuses on it's surface between the balance of power between normal everyday people (Like you and I), and (I don't know a better way to put it) cryptid kids; Wednesday (played by Jenna Ortega) is part of the latter (obviously).  As the plot thickens, we find out that power struggle between the groups has been ingrained in everyone for generations. You may even say it's been institutionalized since the community's inception. 

People can read into this however they want; what really matters is if it works or not.  Given that the kids are literally werewolves, sirens, medusas and other cryptid creatures of lore, it is my opinion if you feel this dynamic is only in place to make you feel fragile, than you need  to (in the words of my grandfather) 'get a tougher skin'.  Honestly, it's a TV show, are you that wounded?

As these kids are in fact literally and physically outcasts to our society, their struggles being so and trying to fit in work in this story.  I believe because Wednesday isn't physically a cryptid people expected something else.  She's always been, along with her whole family obviously not normal and thus outcasts like the rest. 

What I really enjoyed about this is the dynamic between Jenna and the un-talking member of the Adams' family, Thing (physically played by **Victor Dorobantu**).  The actor wears a green suite except for his hand and contorts his way through every scene. The result is a way more realistic human hand running around than any CGI could have ever done. I also love the duplicity between Wednesday and her trying-to-be / would-be warewolf roommate, Endid (joyfully played by **Emma Myers**).  There are honestly quite a few very likeable supporting characters that make the gloom and doom (that I love) from the main character and balance it into something even more plateable. 

If your nostalgic for the kooky family, the show has plenty of fan service that isn't too blatant (at least not for everything all the time). You get the finger snaps, you get Christina Ricci (for those 90's kids fans), and you get a pretty accurate Adams Family as compared to the original source material. 

I believe the plots mystery will keep people engaged enough (it's no Knives Out or Glass Onion), but combine that with the strength of the characters and you get a really great TV show worth re-watching;  which is personally one of the highest praise I can put on a TV series.

It's not many series that age well. This did. My ratings for this series started around 6 or 7 and pushed their way through to almost perfect score. Is it objectively comparable to other 9's or 10's? I am not sure. Is it, subjectively? Hell yeah.

I finished the series thinking that I will miss them all. You love the characters and you stay engaged no matter what. They all grow, they all feel and they all live the part. In this final season more than the rest, it is crystal clear that they love the show as well. They have their fun with it and that's something really precious for any viewer.

The show touches upon almost if not all the ""big"" hot sci-fi and science subjects. And it does so gracefully. Does it not have cheesy or ""no-sense"" parts? Well yeah it has, how could it not? But who cares? You learn to love even these small drivels as in the grant scheme of the show, they are even funny.

The simple truth is that they rocked it on. Both the actors from the first pilot, to anyone else than joined in the later seasons. This is not a masterpiece series and it doesn't need to be. This is not a filming/acting/etc. crew. It's a family. And I am happy to have spent time with them all. To their ups and their downs.

Yes, this is a review of a fan so it maybe doesn't ring as objective. But this show got from winning my respect to winning my love, keeping my excitement topped along 7 bloody years, making it difficult for me to write an objective piece. I couldn't have wished for anything different.

1521,The Eminence In Shadow,"Animation, Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Action & Adventure",8.1,"Have you ever dreamt of becoming a secret powerhouse, saving the day while appearing totally ordinary? Well, **Eminence in Shadow** turns that childhood fantasy into an epic comedy!

Imagine a guy who pretends to be super powerful in his head, even though he's just a regular dude. This show, **Eminence in Shadow**, is about that guy, and it's hilarious! He thinks he's a master ninja, pulling off incredible feats while his crush watches in awe. In reality, things are...different.

Unlike some anime, where fights are super tense, **Eminence in Shadow** is more like a spoof. It pokes fun at the over-the-top action sequences you might see in other shows. Think of it like the bad guys getting totally wiped out in a funny, exaggerated way, while the main character remains clueless about the true situation.

Here's the twist: this clueless guy is actually building a secret organization! He recruits girls, all wearing these cool slime suits (think adorable and quirky, not scary), and trains them to be his loyal ninja followers. Each girl has her own personality and quirks, making them all super interesting. You'll definitely find yourself rooting for them!

The plot itself is pretty funny. The main character basically makes stuff up, and somehow, it ends up being true in the real world! It's like he's accidentally a genius, even though he has no idea what's actually going on.

If you're a fan of isekai (shows where characters get transported to another world) and power fantasies (stories where the main character is super strong), then **Eminence in Shadow** is definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared for some cringe in the beginning – the main character's delusions can be a bit much for some. But if you stick with it, you'll be rewarded with a hilarious and unique anime experience!

As for the sound and visuals, the voice acting is great and brings the jokes to life. The music is decent, with some awesome moments, but it's not the main attraction. The animation is good, especially during the more epic scenes, but sometimes it feels a bit low quality.

Overall, **Eminence in Shadow** is a fun and lighthearted anime that's perfect for unwinding after a long day.

1529,The West Wing,Drama,8.2,"Without a shadow of a doubt, THE finest political TV drama ever to come out of a studio!

Despite its rather liberal happy-clappy perspective with most of its secondary storylines, TWW is exceptionally well-written and very rarely fails to deliver some rather thought-provoking episodes. 

I have had many boxset marathons with this show over the years, and I must admit my adulation for certain seasons has changed somewhat in that time. Back then I adored the first 4 seasons, while dismissing season 5 outright, and only having a grudging respect for seasons 6 & 7. But these days I much prefer 6&7 over 1, 3 and 4. No idea why but there you go!

As for the acting, well other than Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe and John Spencer the first few seasons were a cast of relative unknowns, but come the middle of S1 it doesn't matter because the likes of Alison Janey's CJ, Bradley Whitford's wonderful Josh Lyman and Richard Schiff's brooding Toby Ziegler play their roles exceptionally well.

Of course the greatest aspect of this show is the writing, especially for the first four seasons when Aaron Sorkin was directly involved. And even after he left under a cloud the writing for season 5 and beyond was still very good, if a little uneven.

It has been awhile since I last picked up on this show. So come the winter months I might just snuggle down and enjoy the walk & talk with these guys once again.","Martin Sheen, Allison Janney, John Spencer, Bradley Whitford, Joshua Malina","without shadow doubt , finest political tv drama ever come studio ! despite rather liberal happy-clappy perspective secondary storylines , tww exceptionally well-written rarely fail deliver rather thought-provoking episodes . many boxset marathons show years , must admit adulation certain season change somewhat time . back adore first 4 season , dismiss season 5 outright , grudge respect season 6 & 7. days much prefer 6 & 7 1 , 3 4. idea go ! act , well martin sheen , rob lowe john spencer first season cast relative unknowns , come middle s1 n't matter like alison janey 's cj , bradley whitford 's wonderful josh lyman richard schiff 's brood toby ziegler play roles exceptionally well . course greatest aspect show write , especially first four season aaron sorkin directly involve . even leave cloud write season 5 beyond still good , little uneven . awhile since last pick show . come winter months might snuggle enjoy walk & talk guy .",1,1

I have to agree with the reviewers who call this the best drama show ever, at least for entertainment value. Of course, it gets panned often for political reasons by people who perhaps don't watch it enough to see that, yes, it is a liberal administration being represented here, but they often make mistakes and fail in their efforts, so it is hardly a progressive utopia. 

I write novels in my spare tome, and I like to think my dialogue is a strong point, so I have nothing but admiration for the fast and witty conversations in this show. You may literally have to watch the series a second time to catch everything thrown at you in their quick back and forth banter, often delivered as they pace around the West Wing set. But that is no hardship either. Much has been made about Aaron Sorkin's departure from the show, and perhaps there was a slight drop in quality because of it, but it was still well worth watching.

1529,The West Wing,Drama,8.2,"The first edition, indeed season, of this political drama is as good as it gets. Aaron Sorkin has created a monster - in just about every sense - and the cast led by Martin Sheen (""President Bartlet"") consistently deliver well as the senior advisors in his administration - alongside some sadly infrequent appearances from his no-nonsense wife (Stockard Channing) - guide us through the daily trials and tribulations accompanying American government. For the most part, the pace is hectic, controlled (sometimes) by the calming, sagacious influence of his Chief of Staff ""Leo"" (John Spencer) and deals with just about every sort of scenario - domestic, foreign, familial and collegiate that comes across the paths of the Director of Communications (Richard Schiff), his deputy (Rob Lowe), the Press Secretary (Allison Janney) as well as ""Josh Lyman"" (Bradley Whitford) - the passionate but occasional liability that is the deputy Chief of Staff. Sorkin and the cast manage, effortlessly, to create a series of scenarios that reminded me of both ""Yes, Minister"" and the original (British) ""House of Cards"" - comedy and humour expertly mixed with politicking on a grand, yet personal, scale. Nothing is off limits insofar as the subjects covered and it presents as authentic a depiction of government as we are ever likely to see. Personally, I though Stockard Channing added loads to this as the First Lady and Janney and Spencer's characters gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, someone in there knew what the hell was going on. Of course it takes an hugely American perspective on things, which as a non-American grated a bit on occasion with an intermingling of fact and fiction that sometimes compromised the integrity of the stories; but in the main it is one hell of a watch. Unfortunately, around about the start of series four, the writing starts to slide and the cast - fresh and vibrant at the beginning of the run - begin to take too great a role behind the camera; the plots become too personal (even romantic) and far-fetched. The original stars feature a bit less and it loses much of it's potency and it's plausibility. Certainly, the last two series which focus on presidential succession and sidelined many of the cast we had followed since day one left me cold and disinterested. By the conclusion I felt there had been maybe two series too many...

1529,The West Wing,Drama,8.2,"Pepa the Pig for Adult Liberals. Or maybe, ""Mickey Mouse Takes Office."" I can't decide.

Perhaps I'm hyper sensitive, having been what equates to an American liberal for most of my life (I'm Danish, and here being liberal puts you on the right, but I've been a lefty for more than forty years), but trying to watch this show instantly fatigues me. Not because of the acting, which is above average, the dialog, which is well-written if overly verbose, not even the stories, which seem implausible but entertaining, and this IS fiction, so you need to allow for unrealistic and entertaining things happening 24/7. Otherwise it'd get boring.

No, what drains my energy is the way it treats me as a mental toddler. It's the way the resentment for people with opposing views (conservatives, religious people, etc.) is matched only by the self-righteousness and the conviction of having the moral high ground and superior intelligence. The ease with which people are divided into moral and immoral boxes based on their religious views, political affiliation, or even demography. And isn't it nice, because we all agree that religious zealots are terrible, right? That conservatives are immoral, right? That Texans are stupid, right? Lucky we have our club, where we're educated, virtuous and bearers of The Right Morals™. 

Episode one present a religiously based conflict that is so overly constructed that it borders on pathetic (hence my Pepa the Pig reference). The conflict is resolved not through discussion or discourse, but by president Mickey Mouse turning up and revealing how the religious group is in cahoots with people sending his twelve-year-old daughter a death threat in the form of basically a voodoo doll. How convenient. Such lazy writing. I wonder how a diplomatic person with some deep rhetorical skills might have solved that conflict in lieu of one side basically declaring moral bankruptcy. I don't know, maybe some kind of political figure, like a head of state or something. Guess that's for another show. This show has trumpets blaring instead, while the camera pans across our great imaginary president Highground. 

Just for the record, even though my father was a priest and I was raised Christian, today I think religion is garbage and I've been an atheist for about 25 years. But that's my opinion and it says nothing about my moral values, and what anyone else believes doesn't either. I just don't appreciate this lazy and presumptuous ""religious conservative therefore bad, amirite?"" fallacy. 

I quit at the beginning of episode two, when President Mouse basically says they didn't lose Texas in the primaries because of a joke about cowboy hats, but because Texans are stupid, or ""when the president learned Latin,"" as it puts it. One has to wonder if the writers just don't care about alienating an entire state of potential viewers, or if they think Texans are so stupid they didn't catch that insult. Either way, the club that you're supposed to be in to be able to watch something like this and think it's okay to disrespect your opponent's intelligence and points of view in this manner is not one I want to be a member of. Not anymore. 

I'm done with this restrictive and divisive club of supposedly morally superior intelligencia, with the undercurrent of resentment and obnoxious entitlement. I'm sick and tired of having echo chamber ""discussions"" where you constantly fear stepping out of line lest you be called a bigot, or a racist, or a misogynist, or a Nazi, or whatever is the most efficient card you can use to shut down even the slightest sign of dissent from the implicit party line. 

And yes, as I said, I'm probably hyper sensitive because this to me is such a large problem right now, but that's why I can't watch this. I'm surprised a show from 1999 is this blatantly and unapologetically biased, but maybe that's because I've been liberal myself all that time and it just seemed okay. I mean, the religious and conservatives ARE wrong, and mostly idiots, right? To my religious and conservative friends who watch this and get rightfully offended, from a former liberal who thought this was okay, even truth, and behalf of my other liberal friends who still think like this but aren't bad people, I apologize. 

And think of it like this: With shows like these being made, and much worse media content being released currently,  some people, like me, get increasingly turned off by the divisiveness and implicit brainwashing, to the point where they simply stop being liberals. I don't know what I'm gonna vote next time, but it won't be left. If I were American, I wouldn't vote Democrat. But then, there'd have to be a candidate other than Trump, because I don't think that guy has America's interests at heart, only his own.","Martin Sheen, Allison Janney, John Spencer, Bradley Whitford, Joshua Malina","pepa pig adult liberals . maybe , `` mickey mouse take office .

So having said that said, it came as no small surprise, to have to admit that ""Skeleton Crew"" is not only not dreadful, its actually reasonably accessible to adults, too.

Lets start with the obvious. Yes, its new Disney so I'm not surprised to find its a little woke. Thankfully, its only a ""little woke"" and whilst I find that really, really irritating at times and I wish they'd knock it off, its delivered in small doses. 

On the positive side this series actually tells a not unfamiliar but entirely engaging story. It feels like a mix of the 1985 film ""The Goonies"" and a pirate adventure, Robert Louis Stevenson (""Treasure Island"") style, in space. More specifically, the Star Wars universe. 

Its focus is a group of kids, human and alien who find themselves castaways on a pirate space ship, having an adventure far away from the planet, they call home.To make matters more complicated, space pirates want to capture them to find the location of their home-world, as its considered a mythological treasure planet. Oh and there's an alleged Jedi, just to round things out. 

This series works because its inherently familiar, dipping into tropes of adventure, family and friendship. Plus its special effects are unsurprisingly excellent. The cast too, have great chemistry, so there's a win on that front, as well.

In summary, I never thought I'd ever again find myself promoting a Star Wars franchise production but ""Skeleton Crew"" is actually really good. Sure it might be because, in my estimation so much that's gone before hasn't been especially inspiring, shall we say but irrespective, looking at this series in isolation from everything else, its thus far, still decent. We are only on episode two so if they screw it up, I'll revise this review and rating.

This series does a great job in explaining the human condition. It tackles the idea that the gods/God took away our sight after years trapped underground (in nuclear silos) by basically shouting at us with ""God thunder"" (nuclear weapons).

Of course, the word 'nuclear' becomes lost after decades/centuries underground, and of course, the idiots we are create a new religion to bind the majority to the lies we tell ourselves.

The lie told throughout this story is that we have no sight because sight is evil since we can do many evil things by having it. Yet, the state of the world in the show is one of power-hoarding, classism, and war.

*Based on the full first season handed to press*

""The Last of Us is the first live-action videogame adaptation able to finally break the frustrating curse, reaching the so-desired unprecedented level of excellence.

Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann construct a complex character study driven by fascinating protagonists, Joel and Ellie, exploring the grief, traumas, and tragedies of their lives through unimaginable moral dilemmas, emotionally heavy conversations, and devastating moments.

Save for rare exceptions, the episodic narrative formula is remarkably efficient, offering a panoply of intriguing characters and outstanding performances - Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey clearly stand out from the rest. A more intimate, grounded version of a post-apocalyptic world that doesn't lack gory, violent action/horror sequences. Gustavo Santaolalla's score couldn't be a better fit.

I am the definition of nit-picky when it comes to writing, production, and character development, especially with pre-existing and beloved material.

1575,The Last Of Us,Drama,8.59,"**Had the potential to be great. But it is just mediocre HBO stuff and sometimes really bad.**

I can't say that the show is bad in general. But it is far from living up to its potential. And episode 3 has show us that it can really suck (no pun intended) at times.

I am going to loosely address some reasons for why I think this show is disappointing and not as good as it could be:

- Bad casting of main characters, unnecessary type-switching.

Though I think that most of the actors are good, a lot of them and especially the main characters are not matching their counterparts from the game and the game (at least TLOU, Part I) just nailed it. The actors are good, but the casting choices still are just bad. Especially Ellie is just miscast all the way.

- Bad chemistry between the characters.

There is no matching chemistry between the actors of Joel & Tess or Joel & Ellie.

- Pointless deviations from the original story (see episode 3).

Those deviations don't add anything good to the story, they are just annoying distraction at best and derailment at worst.

- Sometimes just stupid, boring or pointless.

There is more examples than just the bigger part of episode 3 for that.

- Mediocre storytelling.

When it sticks to the main plot, it's not bad. But it's not really good either.

After episode 3 I decided to take a break from watching the show and before I would continue to watch, I will wait till the whole season has aired and the reviews came in. If according to the non-shill and non-cheerleader reviews the show will give us more crap in the direction of episode 3, I'm out for good.","Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey","* * potential great . mediocre hbo stuff sometimes really bad . * * ca n't say show bad general . far live potential . episode 3 show us really suck ( pun intend ) time . go loosely address reason think show disappoint good could : - bad cast main character , unnecessary type-switching . though think actors good , lot especially main character match counterparts game game ( least tlou , part ) nail . actors good , cast choices still bad . especially ellie miscast way . - bad chemistry character . match chemistry actors joel & tess joel & ellie . - pointless deviations original story ( see episode 3 ) . deviations n't add anything good story , annoy distraction best derailment worst . - sometimes stupid , bore pointless . examples bigger part episode 3 . - mediocre storytelling . stick main plot , 's bad .

1575,The Last Of Us,Drama,8.59,"""The Last of Us"" is a post-apocalyptic TV series based on the popular video game of the same name. The story follows the journey of Joel, a smuggler, and Ellie, a teenage girl who may be the key to finding a cure for a deadly fungal infection that has ravaged the world.

The series features outstanding performances from Pedro Pascal as Joel, Bella Ramsey as Ellie, and Anna Torv as Tess. The chemistry between the main characters is excellent, and the casting is spot-on.

The show's writing is superb, and it captures the essence of the video game while adding a fresh perspective. The narrative is engaging, and the pacing is just right, with each episode leaving you on the edge of your seat, eager to see what happens next.

The show's production value is top-notch, with stunning visuals and cinematography that capture the bleak and haunting atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world. The use of practical effects and makeup is impressive and adds to the overall immersion of the story.

Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is an outstanding TV series that does justice to the source material. It's a must-watch for fans of the video game and anyone who enjoys gripping and emotional storytelling. I would rate it a 9 out of 10.

Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey) need to travel across an America devastated by a fungus which turns people into infectious 'zombies' or rogue raiders. The two main characters are brilliantly played and I think this probably secures Bella Ramsey's career. The rendering of the devastated landscapes and cities was amazing and very plausible. The plot was thin but enough to keep one's interest and, I'd guess, thicker than the computer game and most other zombie apocolypse films.

I think they did good job matching this actor to the character. Gerrard Buttler would be another great choice as well. Actress who's playing Ellie's character is nailing it as well, although in game she has blue eyes and actress has brown eyes. But I think it's not that bad. But like I said, there are bad matches too because of propaganda put in this show as well sadly. For example, Joe's daughter in original source (game) is white, however geniuses in show decided that black daughter should be better for him. Also, Tommy's new wife is white in game, but in show they made her black on purpose which is very obvious. Also there's whole episode dedicated to LGBT propaganda (episode 3). Sady this crap is ruining amazing show, but it is what it is... That's why I'm  giving this show 7/10. If not the cancer woke agenda, I would give it 10/10. I mean, if we close an eye on propaganda, show itself is very good and interesting and very close to original game.

As of 2018 The edginess is gone. There are no risks in the jokes. They all consist of two things, 1. Trump is bad. and 2. This was a thing, remember it?

Neither of those really work for me. Make fun of Trump all you want, but do it with a punch line. Most of the time they forget the punchline. Simply not liking him is NOT a punchline. You have to exaggerate something, make it satire, mock it in some way. I don't even care if it's a cruel mockery...so long as it doesn't seem like they are just stating an opinion.

Opinions are NOT jokes.

That's not a joke, that's just asking me to remember something.

Again, if they had a punch line, if they said something about what they were asking me to remember, then it might be funny...but they don't. The jokes are literally ""this was a thing, laugh at it."" and that's not funny. It has to be followed up with something.

It has been the catalyst for so many careers, e.g. Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray, Will Ferrell  etc... The show has definitely had its ups and downs but, in taking a step back it is evident that the show has remained consistently mixed in it entire run. 

Not every season has had great writers or talent, some actors have been much more successful than others, and yet it has always found an audience. My favourite era of the show was the mid 2000s with Bill Hader and Andy Samberg, but most people have a a preference for whatever season they had as a teenager. The consistency of structure and crew unites all the different casts, creating a familiar image and sensibility, found in every season.

There will always be a host monologue, musical guest, Weekend Update and most importantly, it will always be LIVE! The production process of a pitch meeting with the host, staying up all night on Tuesdays to write, read-through and dress rehearsal. Whether it's 1975 or 2023, everyone endures the same experience (although whether they have the aid of cocaine is certainly a difference!). 

The argument SNL hasnt been funny since the ""insert previous ten years"" is redundant. Every season of the show has been criticised for not being funny but every season of the show has produced hilarious sketches and shone a light on the new faces of comedy. In the 70s they had Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, the 80s they had Julia Louis Dreyfus and Conan O'Brien, the 90s they had Will Ferrell and Eddy Murphy, the 2000s Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the 2010s Kate McKinnon and Vanessa Bayer and finally in the 2020s we have Bowen Yang and Marcello Hernandez.

For those curious about the future of Takagi and Nishikata, the ""Moto"" manga offers a glimpse into their lives 10 years later, maintaining the wholesome charm of the main series.

Although a Takagi VR game was released, it fell short of expectations. However, there's still plenty to enjoy, such as watching Nishikata's voice actor Yuuki Kaji playfully tease Rie Takahashi, who voices Takagi, on the ""LEGOF"" channel. These interactions add an extra layer of fun for fans of the series.

In conclusion, ""Teasing Master Takagi-san"" is a fantastic anime for anyone who loves slice of life and romance genres. It's particularly great if you're looking for something light-hearted and uplifting. While it may not have the most complex storyline or animation, it excels in delivering a cute, funny, and wholesome experience. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime, and it has become one of my favorites. Though it isn't perfect and could benefit from some story and character development improvements, it still deserves a very good score of 8 out of 10.

It's so political you can predict the winner in the first episode now, you can just check the DEI boxes and say ""that one is going to win,"" and you're going to be absolutely correct.

And that's a pretty big change from the first 6 seasons where the show felt like an actual competition and you saw some pretty impressive things.  Now one contestant can actually flip over another to take the spotlight... and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is still going to dictate who the winner is.

But, post Nashville shooting, the last show is full of 7's, the signs signifying that the shooter was the actual victim.  And it's all done whilst playing the victim role.  The show can support someone that killed two 9-year-olds because of their religion, and then pretend that they are the ones under attack.

That's a step too far.

1621,Story Of A Mermaid,"Drama, Family",5.5,"The drama was really something different even when compared to others of its time, well, it was so initially, I'll get into details later. The cast selection were mostly good except for Choi Jae Ho and Han Hye Sook which were an unsuccessful choice. Han Hye Sook, despite playing a critical role in the story, she always felt out of place and out of character. Ironically, she played as a famous skillful actress. Choi Jae Ho, had a small side role as the director but later on, the drama turned him into something much more and gave him a lot of attention which was an awful unsuccessful transition and a complete unplanned mismatch. At first, I found Ma Rin & Ma Joon interactions to be unbearably annoying but it ended up being quite fun. Props to Lee Jae Eun, she really got into the role of Ma Rin. On the other hand, her character became horrendous once the director got involved with her. The writer put a lot of character in these characters which allowed for a lot of possible interactions. The drama had tons of small irrelevant scenes between these characters. At first I though it was a detrimental trait that will plague its length but the drama quickly managed to turn that into its own identity. 

The entire revenge plotline ended within the first 100 episodes which led to the beginning of the drama's major problems. The first 120 episodes or so were great, carefully calculated, intriguing, progressed smoothly and developed naturally. However, the subsequent episodes between 130-215 things changed drastically. The drama became strange and static, the 2 leads characters became completely irrelevant and the story shifted towards Ma Joon & Ye Young. Even then, Ma Joon & Ye Young didn't get the same treatment of intrigue and natural development. Around episodes between 215 to 235 the drama was trying to build a new plotline for the long term despite its strange new direction but everything came down crashing with the last 13 episodes. It felt like they had a lot more plans but had to end the drama within a few episodes. I had to double check around the last 13 episodes to see if they changed the writer because the shift was too drastic. The writer became extremely childish and tacky with writing conflicts and tension for these few last episodes. Now, arriving to the last episode, things gotten a lot worse. Compared to its earlier pace and taking into consideration its huge length, everything was moving at a crazy rapid pace for the last episode with lots of cuts, skips and gaps. I refuse to believe there wasn't a major problem happening behind the scenes. All of that led to the most questionable choice of immature silly ending that was just trying to pull the viewers' leg and yanking any sense of satisfaction. It didn't match the overall tone of the drama. I really enjoyed everything about its earlier episodes. The drama had the perfect sweet spot around episodes 130-140 to wrap things up and end it reasonably. 

Regarding the ending: According to a statement from the production team, the ending suggests a reunion as it shows Ah Ri Young, who has recovered from the shock and skipped over two years after the traffic accident, enjoying a happy moment with Joo Wang, their daughter, and the son born between them.","Jang Seo-hee, Woo Hee-jin, Kim Sung-min, Jung Bo-seog, Park Tam-hee","drama really something different even compare others time , well , initially , 'll get detail later . cast selection mostly good except choi jae ho han hye sook unsuccessful choice . han hye sook , despite play critical role story , always felt place character . ironically , play famous skillful actress . choi jae ho , small side role director later , drama turn something much give lot attention awful unsuccessful transition complete unplanned mismatch . first , find rin & joon interactions unbearably annoy end quite fun . prop lee jae eun , really get role rin . hand , character become horrendous director get involve . writer put lot character character allow lot possible interactions . drama tons small irrelevant scenes character . first though detrimental trait plague length drama quickly manage turn identity . entire revenge plotline end within first 100 episodes lead begin drama 's major problems . first 120 episodes great , carefully calculate , intrigue , progress smoothly develop naturally . however , subsequent episodes 130-215 things change drastically . drama become strange static , 2 lead character become completely irrelevant story shift towards joon & ye young . even , joon & ye young n't get treatment intrigue natural development . around episodes 215 235 drama try build new plotline long term despite strange new direction everything come crash last 13 episodes . felt like lot plan end drama within episodes . double check around last 13 episodes see change writer shift drastic . writer become extremely childish tacky write conflict tension last episodes . , arrive last episode , things get lot worse . compare earlier pace take consideration huge length , everything move crazy rapid pace last episode lot cut , skip gap . refuse believe n't major problem happen behind scenes . lead questionable choice immature silly end try pull viewers ' leg yank sense satisfaction . n't match overall tone drama . really enjoy everything earlier episodes . drama perfect sweet spot around episodes 130-140 wrap things end reasonably . regard end : accord statement production team , end suggest reunion show ah ri young , recover shock skip two years traffic accident , enjoy happy moment joo wang , daughter , son bear .",0,0
1629,Emperor Wang Gun,"War & Politics, Drama",3.2,"Just another historical drama confirming, yet again, how much I don't like seeing 'Choi Soo Jong' in a historical setting. You would be dreaming if you thought the drama will utilize the 200-episodes runtime wisely. Expect a lot of useless scenes/chapters/arcs/stories/characters. I really wish they didn't waste too much time with the childhood period, the first +20 episodes were too much for an introduction. A quick introduction of max 2-3 episodes would have been way more than enough to establish what needed to be established.

When zooming out, the drama is split into 3 major parts. The first 1/3 consisted of the back story and the personal relationships. The second 1/3 consisted of forming the religion then turning it into a cult and watching madness ensues. The last 1/3 is was just generic wars and battles. The last 1/3 had a major tone shift and turned the drama into something different. It was a bit too disconnected to associate it with the first 2/3 after what had been already established. It should have been its own thing and the drama should have ended after the second 1/3.

1653,The Penguin,"Drama, Crime",8.471,"**The Penguin: A Gripping Journey into the Ruthless Rise of a True Villain**

I am writing this review after just finishing watching the first and probably only season of ""The Penguin"" today. For me, it's an 8/10 (which, on my scale, is a very good rating, though on IMDb that’s more like a 9/10). It’s an HBO series. While it’s not perfect (but what is, really?), I think the series is very, very well done. I don’t expect there to be a second season, nor is there a need for one; it works perfectly as a standalone miniseries.

The series builds on the movie The Batman (with Robert Pattinson in the lead role) and follows the Penguin’s rise to power, bridging the story between that movie and the planned sequel.

I can only recommend it — but I ask you, if it doesn’t grab you right away, please at least watch through the third episode and then decide.

You don’t necessarily need to have seen The Batman either, since the Penguin appears only as a side character there, merely a capo in Gotham’s mafia. The series does reference a few events from the movie (such as some neighborhoods flooding after a terrorist attack), but, as I said, you don’t need to know the specifics to follow the plot. Still, it wouldn’t hurt to have seen the movie, especially since it’s quite good.

It’s also worth mentioning that we're dealing with an anti-hero here who is, essentially, a villain. I won’t go into more detail on that — it’s part of the experience to discover this character’s nature, and perhaps to be as deceived by him as the other characters in the series are by the Penguin’s manipulations.","Colin Farrell, Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Deirdre O'Connell, Clancy Brown","* * penguin : grip journey ruthless rise true villain * * write review finish watch first probably season `` penguin '' today . , 's 8/10 ( , scale , good rat , though imdb ’ like 9/10 ) . ’ hbo series . ’ perfect ( , really ? ) , think series , well do . ’ expect second season , need one ; work perfectly standalone miniseries . series build movie batman ( robert pattinson lead role ) follow penguin ’ rise power , bridge story movie plan sequel . recommend — ask , ’ grab right away , please least watch third episode decide . ’ necessarily need see batman either , since penguin appear side character , merely capo gotham ’ mafia . series reference events movie ( neighborhoods flood terrorist attack ) , , say , ’ need know specifics follow plot . still , ’ hurt see movie , especially since ’ quite good . ’ also worth mention 're deal anti-hero , essentially , villain . ’ go detail — ’ part experience discover character ’ nature , perhaps deceive character series penguin ’ manipulations .",-1,1

1655,Star Trek: Discovery,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Action & Adventure, Drama",7.1,"It's hard/impossible to find an online review of the full season.  The full 15-episode Season 1 is available on Netflix here in Europe. Access in the USA is via other paid services, at least on initial release, but American viewers might be able to catch up with this on Netflix if they travel.  Meanwhile all initial reviews are based on the pilot (episodes 1 and 2 combined).  The pilot attracted good reviews - more than the full season deserves - in part simply from the pleasure of seeing a new Star Trek series on screen. 

By the end of Season 1, it feels uneven.  There are some great ideas lurking in this, but it also has some serious issues: bad pacing, terrible acting in parts, and some obvious signs of a limited budget.

Highlights:

* Jason Isaacs as Captain Lorca is one of the best Star Trek captains: tough, bold, decisive, commanding, but also human and flawed.
* Sonequa Martin-Green is a fine protagonist and very watchable - it's interesting that the captain is not the main character. She successfully portrays an upright, capable but insubordinate character through the season's full story arc, and it's all plausible. A shame that her Vulcan upbringing doesn't come into the story so much in the season's later episodes.
* The romantic relationship given most screen time is between two men (a timely 21st century update in Star Trek's long tradition of diversity).  It is well handled: we see that these men have a strong and loving relationship and there is a deep emotional hit later when one of them is harmed.
* The subtitle options include ""Klingon"".

Lowlights:

* The Klingon race has been ""rebooted"" as a race of cumbersome, slow, religious nuts.  The prosthetics look nothing like earlier incarnations of the Klingons.  The idea of these beings as the galaxy's fiercest warriors is preposterous.  A serious design mis-step here.
* The timeline here predates the Original Series by around 10 years, but the Discovery appears to have more modern (and far more reliable) technology than the Enterprise ever did, even though this is supposed to be an older vessel.  The uniforms also look more up-to-date.  These things are going to irritate the fans.
* In an entire 15 episode season the crew visit a grand total of ... three planets.  I guess this minimises production expenditure on location shoots, but it severely limits the sense of adventure and discovery.  Even a low-budget sci-fi show like Killjoys (excellent if you haven't seen it yet) has more planets than this.
* Michelle Yeoh - I don't know if she is unwell or what, but this formerly great actor ruins most of the scenes she is in.  She can't even say simple lines correctly (her intonation is wrong and the wrong words are stressed).  If this is an intended effect then it's extremely badly portrayed.  Her character here is supposed to have a Malaysian accent (we know this because at one point she explains that she was born in Langkawi - that's an island in Malaysia) but Malaysian people don't maul English like this.  Overall just a shame: presumably a good chunk of the acting budget was spent on this headline name, and she's easily the worst actor in the show.

A series like Star Trek wouldn't be complete without its special effects.  Here again there is a mixed bag: some beautiful work with the 'mycelia' and the general space scenes are pretty, though it all seems a bit static.  The bridge and ship interiors are too sparse - Engineering lacks any sense of powerful forces being held in check by advanced machinery.  A trick shot where the camera moves from outside the ship, through the window/view screen, to the interior of the Bridge is used over and over again - nice the first couple of times.

Overall grade B.  It feels like a missed opportunity to bring this much-loved franchise up to date.  Non-fans are likely to give up on this before the end of the season, and I can't really blame them.  Fans are going to be, at least, annoyed.

There have been other recent geek favourites which have disappointed, even though they have had big budgets and big names involved. Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice is the clearest example.  I believe the root cause of these problems is that studios put key people in charge, as producers or directors or screen writers or casting directors, who are just not that into the source material.  Some people think that sci-fi fans will swallow any old rubbish.  That is patronising and it is a mistake, especially in this era of vast viewing choice.  Fans hate to be patronised.  The fans are looking for movies and TV shows made with integrity, respect and love.  Anything made with that level of care will have no problem attracting new, younger fans.  The positive audience reaction to Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fine example.

Star Trek: Discovery was - you would hope - aiming for that target.  It does have some of the elements right (Captain Lorca puts on a splendid Scottish accent at one point).  But overall it does not make the grade.","Sonequa Martin-Green, Doug Jones, Mary Wiseman, Anthony Rapp, Wilson Cruz","'s hard/impossible find online review full season . full 15-episode season 1 available netflix europe . access usa via pay service , least initial release , american viewers might able catch netflix travel . meanwhile initial review base pilot ( episodes 1 2 combine ) . pilot attract good review - full season deserve - part simply pleasure see new star trek series screen . end season 1 , feel uneven . great ideas lurk , also serious issue : bad pace , terrible act part , obvious sign limit budget . highlight : * jason isaacs captain lorca one best star trek captain : tough , bold , decisive , command , also human flaw . * sonequa martin-green fine protagonist watchable - 's interest captain main character . successfully portray upright , capable insubordinate character season 's full story arc , 's plausible . shame vulcan upbringing n't come story much season 's later episodes . * romantic relationship give screen time two men ( timely 21st century update star trek 's long tradition diversity ) . well handle : see men strong love relationship deep emotional hit later one harm . * subtitle options include `` klingon '' . lowlights : * klingon race `` reboot '' race cumbersome , slow , religious nut . prosthetics look nothing like earlier incarnations klingons . idea beings galaxy 's fiercest warriors preposterous . serious design mis-step . * timeline predate original series around 10 years , discovery appear modern ( far reliable ) technology enterprise ever , even though suppose older vessel . uniform also look up-to-date . things go irritate fan . * entire 15 episode season crew visit grand total ... three planets . guess minimise production expenditure location shoot , severely limit sense adventure discovery . even low-budget sci-fi show like killjoys ( excellent n't see yet ) planets . * michelle yeoh - n't know unwell , formerly great actor ruin scenes . ca n't even say simple line correctly ( intonation wrong wrong word stress ) . intend effect 's extremely badly portray . character suppose malaysian accent ( know one point explain bear langkawi - 's island malaysia ) malaysian people n't maul english like . overall shame : presumably good chunk act budget spend headline name , 's easily worst actor show . series like star trek would n't complete without special effect . mix bag : beautiful work 'mycelia ' general space scenes pretty , though seem bite static . bridge ship interiors sparse - engineer lack sense powerful force hold check advance machinery . trick shoot camera move outside ship , window/view screen , interior bridge use - nice first couple time . overall grade b. feel like miss opportunity bring much-loved franchise date . non-fans likely give end season , ca n't really blame . fan go , least , annoy . recent geek favourites disappoint , even though big budget big name involve . batman vs superman : dawn justice clearest example . believe root cause problems studios put key people charge , producers directors screen writers cast directors , source material . people think sci-fi fan swallow old rubbish . patronise mistake , especially era vast view choice . fan hate patronise . fan look movies tv show make integrity , respect love . anything make level care problem attract new , younger fan . positive audience reaction star war : force awaken fine example . star trek : discovery - would hope - aim target . elements right ( captain lorca put splendid scottish accent one point ) . overall make grade .",1,1

Star Trek is optimistic and light even when it goes a little gritty. It's supposed to be an optimistic future where Earth strives for a Utopia...and Discovery isn't that at all.

Discovery is bleak and pessimistic and really, that's not what I want when I want to sit down and watch Star Trek.

And then it's weighted in the present, and again, that's not what I want in science fiction.

A reflection of the present is fine...a satire on it is fine...but to try and anchor the plots so much in the present that it becomes BLATANT...that's not science fiction anymore.

And then what did they do to the orcs...I'm sorry, Klingons? In a prequel series? I know they have always micro-evolved in appearance but this is insanely different.

They are so different that it's almost insulting to even the casual fan let alone their loyal base.

And then, yeah, like so many other shows it does that thing where it's almost racist towards the ONE demographic that it is currently politically correct to be racist against...and that's not Star Trek either, if anything, it's the opposite because that was intended to be solved a long, long time ago in the franchise's history.

The Klingons are the bad guys for NOT wanting the Federation to cleanse them of their culture and heritage...they are written as the bad guys for NOT wanting to be ethnically cleansed!!!!!!

I know it's a play on White Supremacy, but seriously, this does NOT make the Federation look like the good guys here. Now, if the Klingons wanted to Ethnically cleanse OTHER groups, that would make them look like the bad guys. NOT the other way around.

1659,The Good Wife,Drama,7.6,"This show was recommended to us by a relative. It was running on a treating service we had, so we started watching it. We liked it enough so that when our service suddenly stopped running The Good Wife we signed up for CBS All Access.

We have seen all seven seasons now and while I still liked it, the plots started to lag for me a bit in later seasons. Their professional relationships between different law firms or them personally kept changing, reminding me of the show Friends, where it felt like the main characters took turns dating each other.

Another element of the plots that struck me was the formula they seem sped to follow. They used a long running plot, usually political, that ran for entire seasons sometimes, and also had cases they handled that wrapped up in one show. Those cases often ran the same course: first one side would do well in court, then the other side would introduce something that helps them, and then the first side would — you get the idea. I called them reversals and got so I expected them every ten minutes or so for each show. Plus their investigators seemed really good at digging up dirt Fast. It isn’t a terrible thing. They only have 40+ minutes for each show and they want to cram drama in where they can. Perhaps I just noticed it more because I write novels and do a lot of plotting myself.

But we watched the entire seven seasons. I won’t be tempted to watch them again, but I don’t regret the time spent on them either.

While the romance is a side thing, they could have given it more attention to let it mature and develop more appropriately or remove the romance altogether.

It can be difficult to maintain tension and drama describing true events that the viewer might be already aware of to some extent, but this program manages it nicely. It is a little predictable in how it tells the story, by which I mean it uses several angles from different characters' points of view: the scientists and administrators representing the Russian government, the employees of the power plant and other disposable workers, and of course the masses of people caught up in the disaster; and finally, for a close-up look, the wife of one of the plant's employees, who follows her husband to a Moscow hospital. All of these perspectives are handled well.

All that was required for such catastrophic fallout was the escape of less than 5 percent of the reactor's nuclear fuel. Originally it had contained more than 250 pounds of enriched uranium – enough to pollute and devastate most of Europe. And if the other three reactors of the Chernobyl power plant had been damaged by the explosion of the first, then hardly any living and breathing organisms would have remained on the planet._

Released in May 2019, with over a year remaining of the Trump administration, a show about a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union some 33 years ago probably doesn't jump out as being especially relevant to the here and now. Except, of course, it's not really about a nuclear accident. It's about governmental denial and subterfuge, it's about the dangers of rejecting science in favour of ideology. It's about the importance of a free press. It's about lies. It's about people who attempt to speak truth to power. And it's about the people who suffer when an entire legislative system is rotten to the core.

And with that in mind, it suddenly becomes a lot more relevant to 2019 United States.

Created, written, and executive produced by Craig Mazin (whose previous work inexplicably includes _Scary Movie 3_, _Scary Movie 4_, _Superhero Movie_, _The Hangover Part II_, and _The Hangover Part III_), _Chernobyl_ is directed by TV and music video veteran Johan Renck as part-horror movie, part-cautionary tale, and part-political treatise. Mazin began researching the Chernobyl explosion in 2013, initially as a hobby. Thinking he knew what had happened reasonably well, he was surprised to find how much he didn't know, and how much the majority of people didn't know, and it was this knowledge-gap that led to the show. Equal parts political deconstruction and painstaking recreation of what it must have been like to live through the worst nuclear disaster in history, the show presents a terrifying, nightmare vision of how bad things can get when hard scientific facts are made subservient to political agendas, and governments strive to undermine not only scientific expertise but the very nature of truth itself (the Soviet Union was a big fan of ""alternative facts"" long before the GOP). _Chernobyl_ begins and ends by asking the viewer to ponder the cost of cumulative nation-wide lies. However, it's just as interested in celebrating the heroes as it is assigning blame, and in that sense, it has an extraordinary sense of humanism.

The acting is immense, the writing is incisive and terrifying, the aesthetic is exceptional, and the show was a worthy winner of no less than 10 Emmys from its 18 nominations, including ""Outstanding Limited Series"", ""Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"", ""Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"", ""Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or Movie"" (for ""Please Remain Calm""), ""Outstanding Musical Composition for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"" (for ""Please Remain Calm""), and ""Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Simon Smith for ""Please Remain Calm""). The show also won seven of its 11 nominations at the British Academy Television Craft Awards (including Best Director, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Original Music, and Best Production Design), and two of its four Golden Globe nominations – Best Limited Series or Television Film and Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series or Television Film (Stellan Skarsgård). All in all, Chernobyl is that rarest of beasts – a show which lives up to the hype.

April 26, 1986, 1:23am; near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR. Reactor No. 4 at the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant (aka Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant) explodes, sending out masses of radioactive material. Fire crews are called, but neither they nor the local people have any idea of the severity of the situation. As the Central Committee tries to keep a lid on things, a commission is hastily assembled to investigate the disaster. The commission's head is Boris Shcherbina (a career-best performance from Stellan Skarsgård), Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and a devout party-man who believes it when he's told that the radiation released from the reactor is no stronger than that used in a chest x-ray. The commission's scientific expert is Valery Legasov (a mesmerising Jared Harris), deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute, who immediately realises that the accident is much more serious than the government are saying, and that the people in immediate danger amount not to tens of thousands, but tens of millions.

The show opens with the explosion and then follows Legasov and Shcherbina as they investigate why it happened and unexpectedly form a strong friendship. Along the way, we're introduced to a sizable number of characters, some well-known, many not at all – Ulana Khomyuk (Emily Watson), a nuclear physicist from Minsk (composite character); Lyudmilla Ignatenko (a heartbreaking Jessie Buckley), the wife of one of the first-responders; Vasily Ignatenko (Adam Nagaitis), Lyudmilla's husband; Anatoly Dyatlov (a quite stunning Paul Ritter), Deputy Chief Engineer at Chernobyl and the man in charge of the control room at the time of the explosion; Mikhail Gorbachev (a chameleonic performance from David Dencik), General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; Viktor Bryukhanov (Con O'Neill), director of Chernobyl; Nikolai Fomin (Adrian Rawlins), chief engineer at Chernobyl; Aleksandr Akimov (Sam Troughton doing a lot with a small role), night shift supervisor; Leonid Toptunov (Robert Emms), senior control engineer; General Vladimir Pikalov (Mark Lewis Jones), commander of the Chemical Troops of the USSR; Viktor Chebrikov (Alan Williams), Chairman of the KGB; Andrei Glukhov (Alex Ferns), mining crew chief; Major General Nikolai Tarakanov (Ralph Ineson), supervisor of the clean-up operation; Pavel Gremov (Barry Keoghan), civilian draftee into the clean-up operation (fictional character); Bacho (Fares Fares), Soviet-Afghan War veteran who trains Pavel (fictional character); Zharkov (Donald Sumpter), member of the Pripyat Executive Committee (fictional character); Svetlana Zinchenko (Nadia Clifford), doctor treating those with radiation sickness (composite character); and Andrei Stepashin (Michael McElhatton), Soviet prosecutor (composite character).

Thematically, _Chernobyl_ is anything but subtle. The opening line is ""_What is the cost of lies?_"", and this issue is front and centre for the entire five episodes. The show presents the Soviet Union as a place where lying and statecraft were one and the same, and in so doing, it illustrates what can happen when institutions of government put political ideology above objective facts, when egotistical politicians disregard everything that experts are telling them in favour of their own ill-informed theories (sound familiar?). It is, in essence, a show about the dangers of state-sanctioned obfuscation. The first episode in particular gives us some fine illustrations of a system obsessed with committees, bureaucracy, and secrecy, all built upon an unnecessarily complicated and rigid hierarchy. For example, shortly after the explosion, Bryukhanov explains to the Pripyat Executive Committee,

> _As you can see, we have experienced an accident. A large control tank malfunctioned, damaging reactor building four and starting a fire. I have spoken directly to Deputy Secretary Maryin. Maryin spoke to Deputy Chief Frolyshev, Frolyshev to Central Committee member Dolghikh, and Dolghikh to General Secretary Gorbachev. Because the Central Committee has the greatest respect for the work of the Pripyat Executive Committee, they have asked me to brief you on matters as they stand. First, the accident is well under control._

This sequence goes from the manager of Chernobyl (Bryukhanov) to the Deputy Secretary of the Power Industry (Maryin) to the Deputy Chief of the Machine Building Department of the Central Committee (Frolyshev) to a Politburo member (Dolgikh) to the General Secretary (Gorbachev). And if you think this is an exaggeration, all of these people are real, and this is precisely the sequence of how the information got from Bryukhanov to Gorbachev. As it's presented in the show, there's nothing remotely subtle about it, as we're invited to shake our heads at the ridiculousness of it all. An even more telling example of governmental secrecy occurs in the same scene, as Zharkov addresses the Committee,

> _From the Central Committee all the way down to each of us in this room – we represent the perfect expression of the collective will of the Soviet proletariat. Sometimes, we forget. Sometimes, we fall prey to fear. But our faith in Soviet socialism will always be rewarded. Always. The State tells us the situation is not dangerous. Have faith. The State tells us they do not want a panic. Listen well. True, when the people see police, they will be scared. But it is my experience that when the people ask questions that are not in their own best interest, they should simply be told to keep their minds on their labour – and to leave matters of the State to the State. We seal off the city. No one leaves. We cut the phone lines. Contain the spread of misinformation. That is how you keep the people from undermining the fruits of their own labour. That is how your names become inscribed in the hallways of the Kremlin. Yes, comrades. We will all be rewarded for what we do here tonight. This is our moment to shine._

This speech is met with applause. There's a lot to unpack here, but the line ""keep the people from undermining the fruits of their own labour"" is especially telling. Essentially, ""_keep the people uninformed so they don't ask us to explain ourselves._""

And, to a certain extent, much of the rest of the show depicts how that is exactly what the government has accomplished. If there's an overriding mindset amongst the Soviet people, it's a sense of civic duty, borne of a genuine belief in socialism and total trust in the Central Committee. Not all characters share this trust, but enough of them do to make it an undeniable trope. And for the most part, the show presents this sense of duty to the State as deeply honourable, worthy of a great deal of respect. How the State elicits, manipulates and exploits these feelings is being criticised, not the feelings themselves – a vital distinction. This is seen most clearly when one contrasts the noble self-sacrifices made by multiple characters, often knowingly giving their lives for the State and for one another, with the callous way the politburo look on such sacrifices – they expect people to give their lives because lives have to be given. As Shcherbina says at one point, ""_you will do it because it must be done_"". To the Politburo, the proletariat is not a collective of individuals, it is a single body, and it can afford to lose a person here and there without any significant damage.

Since the series was released, much has been written about the fidelity (or lack thereof) of the representation of the Soviet Union in 1986 – whether such and such a politician doing this is realistic, or such and such a politician saying that is over the top. Without explicit knowledge of the _milieu_, I can't really comment on this aspect of the show, but what I can do is cite another source that seems to suggest the show's depiction of the extraordinary unpreparedness and elaborate web of lies built by the government is most definitely not an exaggeration. In _Children of Chernobyl_, a Canadian documentary filmed in Ukraine just five years after the accident, we're told that in the weeks and months following April 26, hospitals were trying to treat patients despite having no wheels on their IV stands and barely any cancer medication whatsoever. A pack of needles cost 10 rubles (5 times the average daily wage), so cash-strapped hospitals had to reuse syringes across multiple patients. And as part of the massive cover-up attempt, individuals were barred from owning dosimeters, meaning they were unable to test levels of radioactivity for themselves. Indeed, huge numbers of people only became aware of the severity of the problem by listening to foreign news reports on short wave radios (which were illegal in the Soviet Union). After the accident, Dr. Alla Shapiro was asked to prepare a lecture on radiation for a hospital in Kiev, but when she went to the National Medical Library, she discovered that literally every book with the word radiation in it had been taken off the shelves and classified. On May 1, just four days after the explosion, and with rumours spreading about the nature of the disaster, the government urged people to attend the International Workers' Day parades, even in areas they knew to be heavily contaminated (and once word got out to other countries, the vast majority of the official footage of the parades in and around Pripyat were removed from the National Archives). So the show may have some factual inaccuracies here and there, and quite a bit may be exaggerated, but there very much is at least an underlying truth to everything we see.

Aesthetically, _Chernobyl_ is nothing short of masterful, with virtually every creative department knocking it out of the park. The show opens with the explosion, throwing the audience into the chaos and confusion that happened. We're given no info whatsoever on what caused the accident – teasing that out will form the substance of much of the rest of the episodes. However, rather than placing us in the control room at the moment of the explosion, it is instead presented in such a way that immediately establishes that this isn't going to be all spectacle for its own sake. We initially see the explosion in the distance, through the closed window of a character who doesn't even notice it happening until the shockwave hits a couple of seconds later. It's a wholly unexpected way to begin, presenting a massive real-life disaster not from the perspective of spectacle (_Deepwater Horizon_, I'm looking at you), but from a subjective human perspective. This immediately sets up the show's interest in people. The helicopter crash seen in the trailer is shot the same way – we don't cut between objective shots from outside and subjective shots from inside, which would muddle the perspective. Instead, the whole thing is shot from Legasov and Shcherbina's perspective, focusing on their human reactions rather than the fiery spectacle.

As for the cinematography generally, Jakob Ihre (_Quitters_; _Louder Than Bombs_; _Thelma_) shoots everything unfussily, with no real visual gymnastics. However, there are still moments of stark beauty and great artistry. The second episode ends with a dialogueless scene that Michael Mann would be proud of – a terrifying claustrophobic sequence shot almost entirely in pitch darkness with the only light coming from the torches carried by the men on screen. This episode also features perhaps the single most extraordinary shot in the series – a high elevation shot of Pripyat looking down at the residents being evacuated onto a fleet of buses. In the background, the power plant can be seen still burning, whilst the people and the plant are bifurcated by the flats in which they used to live. This is as good an example of thematic photography as you're likely to find.

And then there's the acting. Harris plays Legasov as world-weary and somewhat bitter, but a man whose disillusionment with the Party was nothing compared to what he feels as he sees them trying to cover-up and play down the most serious nuclear disaster in human history. Skarsgård's Shcherbina has an exceptionally well-constructed arc, moving from emotionless apparatchik to perhaps the most relatable character in the show. Skarsgård does some of his best work here when he has no dialogue, conveying everything with his eyes, movements, and facial expressions. And then there's Paul Ritter, who turns Dyatlov into one of the most contemptible characters ever put on screen. I would never have an imagined that such an amiable actor could have made me loathe him so much, but Ritter embraces Dyatlov's narcissism, insecurity, and bullying tendencies and takes them to another level entirely (RIP Mr Ritter).

As for problems, well, if there is one, it is probably that the characters are a little too black and white – the 'good' characters are practically saintly, and the 'bad' characters are almost pure evil. Legasov, for example, is depicted as a truth teller who disapproves of the Soviet system and cares only for the facts. In reality, he was a party man, and he initially agreed with the cover up. Indeed, his dramatic testimony at the trial as depicted in the final episode is entirely fictitious – he was not present at that trail, which lasted weeks and was considered remarkably dull, even for a Soviet show trial. The same issue is apparent with Khomyuk, a composite character representing the many scientists who aided Legasov. Watson is good in the role, but as written, she's fairly obviously a screenwriter's creation, embodying multiple hackneyed Hollywood clichés. She's a fearless truth-teller and truth-seeker, a hugely intelligent woman who is far superior to the idiot men around her (how she discovers the accident is especially preposterous). She purposely gets herself arrested and not an hour later, she's in a meeting with Legasov, Shcherbina and the entire Central Committee. Such a thing would simply not be possible in the USSR. The strange thing is, she's unnecessary. If Mazin wanted a prominent female character, why not use Maria Protsenko, the architect who designed Pripyat and supervised its evacuation?

On the other hand, Bryukhanov and Fomin are presented as utterly detestable, as ignorant as they are callous, completely uninterested in the lives of their employees, concerned only with their own reputations. In essence, many of the characters are either stupid or evil, or both, while the scientists are righteous prophets. And there's not a lot of ground in between.

Chernobyl is a disaster which, as of 2020, is still affecting crops and animals – in Sweden (the first country to learn of the explosion), mushrooms, reindeer, and wild boar are still screened for Cesium-137 contamination and occasionally declared unfit for sale. The disaster also had a profound effect on the geo-political sphere, and is generally seen as the beginning of the end for the USSR, whilst also serving as something of a wake-up call to the world's nuclear powers. At the time of the disaster, the Soviets were manufacturing a missile called R-36M (NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan), which was roughly 100 times as strong as Chernobyl. By 1986, they had 2,700 in their arsenal. Chernobyl really brought into focus just what kind of devastating power we are dealing with here. At its core, however, the show is more interested in what happens when governments stop listening to science, when every smart person in the room is telling a leader one thing, and he or she decides to ignore it based on nothing other than ideology or ego (and yes, Trump's attitude to the ever-worsening global climate crisis is very much the target). An exceptional piece of television in pretty much every way, _Chernobyl_ is as terrifying as it is compelling, as heartbreaking as it is eye-opening.

1699,Chernobyl,Drama,8.683,"I was really excited for this series as I have read a good amount about the USSR and have a personal relationship to it, having been born in a former satellite country. But I came away disappointed. The series really drew out some scenes for no reason, to the point where I felt the need to fast-forward (for example, essentially the ~entire 5 minutes of going under the core to open a valve). I was also frustrated that the series started right at the point of disaster; I think I would have appreciated more context in a backstory section.

1735,Dan Da Dan,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.8,"Dandadan is a manga and anime series that has been criticized for its repetitive formula, which is a common issue in long-running stories. Some fans have expressed their dislike for the series' constant sexual harassment from creatures, which they find gross. However, others have defended the series, stating that the sexual harassment is supposed to be bad and that the series has not run long enough to loop anything.

The formula used in Dandadan is not unique to the series, as many new battle shounens use a similar approach. However, what sets Dandadan apart is its execution and the quality associated with it. The series has been compared to other popular anime and manga series, such as Monogatari and One Piece, which also use formulas to move the plot forward.

Some fans have argued that the formula used in Dandadan is not the problem, but rather how it is executed. They believe that the series has the potential to be engaging, but it needs to evolve and offer more depth as it goes on. The core of the series, which involves the main characters going on adventures and facing challenges, is formulaic, but it can be made more interesting by adding emotional complexity and moral ambiguity.

Overall, the criticism of Dandadan's repetitive formula is not unique to the series, and many fans believe that it has the potential to be a great series if it can evolve and offer more depth. The series has been defended by some fans, who believe that the sexual harassment is supposed to be bad and that the series has not run long enough to loop anything.

It's worth noting that the discussion around Dandadan's formula and its execution is ongoing, and opinions on the series vary widely. Some fans love the series and find it engaging, while others are critical of its formula and execution. Ultimately, whether or not Dandadan is a good series is a matter of personal opinion, and fans will continue to debate its merits.

In conclusion, Dandadan is a series that has been criticized for its repetitive formula, but it also has the potential to be a great series if it can evolve and offer more depth. The series has been defended by some fans, who believe that the sexual harassment is supposed to be bad and that the series has not run long enough to loop anything.

1749,Tom Clancy'S Jack Ryan,"Action & Adventure, Drama, War & Politics",7.7,"Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan isn’t 24 or NCIS, at least from the first episode, but the rest of the season does have the potential to develop into something more.

The series opens as an airstrike takes place in Lebanon, where the seeds of hate are sown for two young survivors. The story then cuts to the present day in Washington D.C. where we find our protagonist rowing in the Potomac River.

Jack Ryan (played by John Krasinski) is a Boston College graduate, veteran U.S. Marine, and in the present a CIA analyst who has been cross-analyzing databases trying to find possible terrorist activity in Yemen. He discovers a pattern of financial transactions that he believes could lead to the next Bin Laden, but his voice is squashed by a recently demoted department chief named James Greer.

Ryan takes steps to go over the head of his superior, and this immediately causes conflict within the CIA section where Ryan feels he is on to something. But Greer soon learns Ryan’s instincts were right, and the two end up flying to Yemen where they’ve found the man suspected of moving $90 million U.S. dollars to fund a terrorist plot.

Considering the show has already been given the green light for a second run, Amazon must be getting some decent reviews and at least enough hype to produce another 8 episodes. But so far this series is a snoozer, and without Krasinski and the benefit of 20 novels and five films based on Tom Clancy’s character, the show would be a flop.

1749,Tom Clancy'S Jack Ryan,"Action & Adventure, Drama, War & Politics",7.7,"* A very pleasant surprise!

We've only just signed up for Prime and this is the first series I watched. I'm glad I did too, because the action is very exciting, the characters are believable - even though they've taken a few liberties on Clancy's originals - and I enjoyed how the focus was swinging to and from the terrorists' point of view.
Krasinski does a fine job as the young Ryan. Not too self effacing and nerdy and not over the top heroic.
It's shot in 4K too and the cinematography is superb, so I'm really looking forward to season two.","John Krasinski, Wendell Pierce, Abbie Cornish, Okieriete Onaodowan, Louis Ozawa","* pleasant surprise !

1749,Tom Clancy'S Jack Ryan,"Action & Adventure, Drama, War & Politics",7.7,"Wendell Pierce is a bit.... young... isn't he? I mean he does a great job, but after James Earl Jones and Morgan Freeman you would expect someone that at least looks a bit older. Someone not so Gen-X.

But then John Krasinski doesn't really look like someone that would have ""Ryan"" as a last name.... and, like Wendell, he does a good enough job too.

John Hoogenakker, however, looks like the role he's playing, but that's really because we all expected him to be Clark. At least the people that read the books expected him to be Clark. So, in my mind, he's playing Clark and not... whatever his name is in whatever episode.

But, Ali Suliman... he does a GREAT job so you get hooked despite the complaints from those of us who really wanted to see, well, the novels.

This isn't really about the novels. It's kind of true to them as in you can see it all fitting into the Ryanverse, but it's also a lot more straight out of the headlines for the W and Obama era presidencies and made in the Trump era where.... it seems more like a show from the past.

Either way, it works and it takes a little to get used to it if you are a fan of the books, or at least the Ford movies (which also took a little bit).

However, once you get passed it, the show is entertaining as all get out and.... for a streaming show, perfectly short in it's seasons, which is FANTASTIC given that shows like The Handmaiden's Tale, The Man in the High Tower, and so many other direct-to-streaming fair have more episodes than story.

Jack Ryan just enough where the filler isn't extreme and you can rest assured that the episodes are used to push the plot along and not just be filler.

AND THEN SEASON 2 HITS....

... and suddenly it's like they have forgotten how to write a suspenseful spy yarn, in fact, for the most part, they stop acting like spies altogether.

It was almost like they said, OK, we got viewers, the writers can be lazy now.

And all the tension and imagination that made Season 1 so much fun vanished in a puff of smoke.","John Krasinski, Wendell Pierce, Abbie Cornish, Okieriete Onaodowan, Louis Ozawa","wendell pierce bite .... young ... n't ? mean great job , jam earl jones morgan freeman would expect someone least look bite older . someone gen-x . john krasinski n't really look like someone would `` ryan '' last name .... , like wendell , good enough job . john hoogenakker , however , look like role 's play , 's really expect clark . least people read book expect clark . , mind , 's play clark ... whatever name whatever episode . , ali suliman ... great job get hook despite complaints us really want see , well , novels . n't really novels .

1773,Icarly,"Comedy, Kids",7.985,"**There is not a lot out there that a guy my age can watch with his 11 year old daughter**. Most of prime time network TV is way too adult themed to feel good about letting her watch, and many of the kid shows are just too annoying for my tastes. Along comes iCarly, a show my daughter and I have watched from the beginning. The show is definitely aimed at kids, but there are enough funny moments (often provided by Spencer, played by Jerry Trainor) to keep me interested as well. All of the four main characters (Carly, Sam, Freddy and Spencer) are likable and have good chemistry. You get the feeling that they like each other off the set as well. As the first season is coming to an end, I can only hope they'll continue making more. I recommend this for any Dad (who has a sense of humor and still knows how to be a kid once in a while) to watch with his kid(s).","Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, Jerry Trainor, Noah Munck","* * lot guy age watch 11 year old daughter * * . prime time network tv way adult theme feel good let watch , many kid show annoy taste . along come icarly , show daughter watch begin . show definitely aim kid , enough funny moments ( often provide spencer , play jerry trainor ) keep interest well . four main character ( carly , sam , freddy spencer ) likable good chemistry . get feel like set well . first season come end , hope 'll continue make . recommend dad ( sense humor still know kid ) watch kid ( ) .",1,1
1773,Icarly,"Comedy, Kids",7.985,"*A review of ""iCarly: Season One, Volume One,"" written in 2009.*  I will just state it at the outset. Although I am 40 years old, and ""iCarly,"" the hit Nickelodeon sitcom, is meant for my children, I honestly think it is the funniest comedy on television right now.

Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) is a junior high schooler in Seattle, living with her older twenty-something brother, pop artist Spencer (Jerry Trainor). Their father is in the military, stationed overseas, and the two live in a giant three story loft apartment with an elevator. Carly's best friend (and budding juvenile delinquent) is Sam (Jennette McCurdy) who lives with her as yet unseen mom. The two also pal around with Freddie (Nathan Kress), a technical whiz whose love for Carly is well known.

Carly, Sam, and Freddie webcast the internet show ""iCarly,"" and the Nickelodeon series follows their rising popularity, and dealings with everyday life at school and home. The DVD features thirteen episodes from the show's first season, plus some special features. I have listed each episode individually (they were all broadcast in 2007 and 2008), along with a capsule review, and my IMDB.com rating (1-10, with 10 being the best), and favorite line from the episode:

DISC ONE
iPilot (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Steve Hoefer)
Because this is the pilot episode, there is some pretty obvious plot exposition mixed into the story of how Carly, Sam, and Freddie decided to do a webcast. We also get to meet sympathetic school Principal Franklin (Tim Russ) and mean teacher Miss Briggs (a hysterical Mindy Sterling). Despite the newness and some awkwardness (Freddie luckily loses the shrillness after this episode), I laughed all the way through. 7/10.
Favorite line: ""Yeah, except he doesn't have Miss Briggs' crazy pointy boobs.""

iWant More Viewers (written by Steve Holland & Steve Molaro, directed by Adam Weissman)
Freddie and Spencer team up against Carly and Sam to see who can come up with the best idea to get more viewers. Hysterical from start to finish, especially the ""Messin' With Lewbert"" bit. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""Pee on Carl?""

iHatch Chicks (written by Steven Molaro, directed by David Kendall)
A science experiment goes wrong and Carly, Sam, Freddie, Spencer, and Freddie's science project partner Duke must find six baby chicks in the giant three story apartment. Consistently funny, with many memorable lines. My seven year old son's reaction upon seeing Miranda Cosgrove in a swimsuit? ""Carly's hot."" 9/10.
Favorite line (tough call): ""Wow, I've never seen dried beef make a boy so happy.""

iDream of Dance (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Adam Weissman)
The ""iCarly"" team decide to open their site to dance videos from their viewers, and are inundated with over three thousand. The trio slogs through a few hundred, fall asleep, and dream themselves into some nicely choreographed dance routines. The music is fun, the backup dancers are sensational, and Trainor's final dance sealed this as my favorite episode of the first season. 10/10.
Favorite lines (no way I could come up with just one): ""How dare you children boo a dancing Scotsman!,"" ""Because I move my legs in a fiery explosion of flailing limbs and floppy passion, wanna see it?,"" ""If he's a nub, then someday I want to be Mrs. Carly Nub,"" ""Get out of here, Gibby, this is my nightmare!,"" and ""Oh, Juiceboy's got a friend.""

iLike Jake (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Steve Hoefer)
When Jake, the hottest guy in school, breaks up with his girlfriend, Carly books him on the web show so he can sing, not realizing he is terrible. Strong plot and pacing, and nice work from Austin Butler as Jake. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""The internet can distort room size.""

iWanna Stay with Spencer (written by Arthur Gradstein, directed by Adam Weissman)
After Carly almost gets hurt by one of Spencer's nutty sculptures, their grandfather decides Carly needs to come live with him in nearby Yakima. Trainor really gets to shine here. 8/10.

iNevel (written by Steve Holland, directed by Steve Hoefer)
My second favorite episode has Carly meeting Nevel, an eleven year old boy who gives ""iCarly"" a bad review on his hugely popular website after Carly rejects his advances. I don't know if he was eligible, but Reed Alexander is Emmy worthy as Nevel. 10/10.
Favorite line: ""Do you feel the rue? Ya feel it!""

DISC TWO
iScream on Halloween (written by Jake Farrow, directed by Steve Hoefer)
In this Halloween themed episode, Carly, Sam, and Freddie webcast from a haunted apartment in their building while Spencer tries to carve a giant pumpkin and keep trick or treaters at bay (he forgot to buy candy). A lesser episode in the ""iCarly"" canon, but still funny here and there. 6/10.
Favorite line: ""You gotta sick mama!""

iSpy a Mean Teacher (written by Steven Molaro, directed by Steve Hoefer)
Carly and Freddie decide to follow Miss Briggs around with a video camera to see what teachers do outside of school, and end up getting trapped in her apartment. Very, very funny stuff, with the entire cast doing well. 9/10.
Favorite lines (tie): ""My Aunt Maggie's boobs look more real than that, and they're ridiculous,"" and ""You dented my blow stick and punctured my squeeze bag!""

iWant to Date Freddie (written by Steve Holland, directed by Adam Weissman)
Freddie's new girlfriend Valerie wants to do a web show of her own, and tries to steal both Freddie and Sam from ""iCarly."" More fast moving than a network sitcom, with Freddie's first date and Valerie's web show the highlights. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""You won't get respect if your back's not erect.""

iWant a World Record (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Roger Christiansen)
Carly, Sam, and Freddie try to get into the Jonas Book of World Records by continuously streaming their webshow for over twenty-four hours. Typically surreal, and funny, episode with excellent supporting guest cast. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""I'm obsessed with the fattest priest. The chubby ones mean nothing to me.""

iRue the Day (written by Dan Schneider, directed by David Kendall)
Nevel returns to ruin ""iCarly"" just as they are getting the pop group Plain White T's on the webcast. Alexander as Nevel still cracks me up. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""You feel it, Carly? You feel the rue? Ya feel it?!""

iPromise Not to Tell (written by Dicky Murphy, directed by Steve Hoefer)
The final episode of this two disc set has Sam hacking into the school's computer and changing Carly and Freddie's grades. They then lie to family and school administration to cover for Sam. Chock full of funny lines, which make up for a couple of awkwardly played scenes. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""Hobos can't afford cable.""

EXTRAS

""Leave it All to Me"" Music Video
Cosgrove also sings the infectious theme song to the series, with a little help from former ""Drake & Josh"" co-star Drake Bell. The video is kind of meh, but the song will stay with you for days. 7/10.

Extended and Exclusive Making of the Video ""Leave it All to Me""
The ""iCarly"" cast also appears in the music video, and are pretty entertaining behind the scenes, too. 7/10.

Behind-the-Scenes Extras
These video bites are about ninety seconds long, and show the cast goofing off behind the scenes. All of them are naturally funny, although you won't learn any huge insight here. 7/10.

So, what can I say? I am a forty year old man who laughs at junior high antics. Although, the show's creator, Dan Schneider, is a comedic genius. He is about my age, and adds a touch of surrealism, some great running gags, and an excellent cast to Nickelodeon, making an even better show than his last hit- ""Drake & Josh."" My one complaint about the DVD collection is that a couple of the shows are out of order, which makes for some ""huh?"" moments when we meet new characters. I have been keeping up with Season 2, with ""iPie"" quite possibly the funniest sitcom episode in cable television history. I can find nothing bad about the cast, all of them shine, including guest and recurring characters like Freddie's mom (Mary Scheer) and evil doorman Lewbert. Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, and Jerry Trainor have such a great chemistry onscreen, it's creepy.

Sure, you might watch this and not find it that hilarious, and that's okay. I am completely immature. You can have your ""Two and a Half Men"" (which is only funny when that kid is on) or your ""How I Met Your Mother"" (which is only funny when Doogie Howser is on), I will take my ""iCarly: Season 1, Volume 1"" DVD set with its running jokes (Schneider's name appearing here and there, hobo jokes, the word 'nub') and giggle alone, waiting anxiously for Season 1, Volume 2 to come out in a little while. I told everyone at work I bought this set for my kids, and that is partially true, but I think I enjoy it more.","Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, Jerry Trainor, Noah Munck","* review `` icarly : season one , volume one , '' write 2009 . * state outset . although 40 years old , `` icarly , '' hit nickelodeon sitcom , mean children , honestly think funniest comedy television right . carly shay ( miranda cosgrove ) junior high schooler seattle , live older twenty-something brother , pop artist spencer ( jerry trainor ) . father military , station overseas , two live giant three story loft apartment elevator . carly 's best friend ( bud juvenile delinquent ) sam ( jennette mccurdy ) live yet unseen mom . two also pal around freddie ( nathan kress ) , technical whiz whose love carly well know . carly , sam , freddie webcast internet show `` icarly , '' nickelodeon series follow rise popularity , dealings everyday life school home . dvd feature thirteen episodes show 's first season , plus special feature . list episode individually ( broadcast 2007 2008 ) , along capsule review , imdb.com rat ( 1-10 , 10 best ) , favorite line episode : disc one ipilot ( write dan schneider , direct steve hoefer ) pilot episode , pretty obvious plot exposition mix story carly , sam , freddie decide webcast . also get meet sympathetic school principal franklin ( tim russ ) mean teacher miss briggs ( hysterical mindy sterling ) . despite newness awkwardness ( freddie luckily lose shrillness episode ) , laugh way . 7/10 . favorite line : `` yeah , except n't miss briggs ' crazy pointy boob .

1817,Dark,"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery",8.4,"Summary:

In the town of Widen, young boys begin to go missing. Everyone in town has dark secrets they are hiding. The lights flicker, dead birds fall from the sky and there is something unusual in the caves out in the forest. 
All the weird stuff going on is similar to events that took place back in 1986 and even before that in 1953 in Winden. 
As both the towns and residents secrets are revealed, the story takes on a truly sinister and disturbing outcome. 

Personal opinion:

This show is full of mystery, secrets, suspense and even time travel. It has a Stranger Things vibe to it, but more of an adult version with a time traveling aspect instead of a monster from another dimension. Every episode will have you on the edge of your seat and contains clues to what is to come. 
A shocking truth is revealed in episode #5 and things only spiral more out of control from there. There are many cheating couples and lots of getting it on, especially in the first season. While I was able to guess the strangers identity before it was revealed, most clues are well hidden and hard to catch unless you rewatch after finishing. 
The second season ends with a huge cliffhanger that has me anxiously waiting for a season 3.

1819,New Girl,Comedy,7.3,"Very enjoyable show on the whole. Zooey Deschanel really is the core, which is made very obvious by her temporary departure in a few episodes in Season 5 (those were certainly the low point for me in the series). I think I might have enjoyed the Coach character, as introduced in the pilot, more than what Winston became (who was often frustrating and only sometimes funny), but ultimately I think both actors did a fine job playing their respective roles. Ultimately I think this is a show that is uniquely appealing to the demographic it focuses on -- late 20s to early 30s -- which is likely a large part of the reason I myself enjoyed it. Would recommend to people in this category; I'll likely do a re-watch of the show myself in a year or two.","Zooey Deschanel, Jake Johnson, Max Greenfield, Lamorne Morris, Hannah Simone","enjoyable show whole . zooey deschanel really core , make obvious temporary departure episodes season 5 ( certainly low point series ) . think might enjoy coach character , introduce pilot , winston become ( often frustrate sometimes funny ) , ultimately think actors fine job play respective roles . ultimately think show uniquely appeal demographic focus -- late 20s early 30s -- likely large part reason enjoy . would recommend people category ; 'll likely re-watch show year two .",1,1
1819,New Girl,Comedy,7.3,"It started out well enough, with special praise going to Max Greenfield who plays, well, I can't think of a polite word to sum up his character, but trust me when I say that whatever you want to call him he's hysterical.

Jake Johnson is a bit of the straight man, but the quirks he has fit perfectly with roommates we have all had in our lives, especially how he ""fixes"" things.

Lamorne Morris had the misfortune of being a last minute replacement... and then had the misfortune of getting who he replaced back on the show. It's explained in both cases but in both cases it's jarring for his character who becomes a reminder of a rocky start.

Zoey herself, however is a bit much as the season wears on. The charm both she and her supporting cast brought to the first few seasons wore a bit thin as it moved on and, eventually, became a little painful to watch.

1823,The Outer Limits,"Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",7.739,"It was kind of all over the place wasn't it?

It wasn't the best show out there, but it had it's moments and when those moments came it was far better than the X-Files.

Unlike the Twilight Zone revivals that lost the moralistic bent, the 90s revival sort of brought it back in full swing and made it feel more like a Twilight Zone revival than an Outer Limits Revival, but let's be honest, the Outer Limits was kind of just a continuation under a different name with more of a lean towards science fiction.

It also does a good job of staying within the genre of science fiction which is something that you scarcely see in shows post Alien when it started to meld into horror as well. So what you get is less X-Files and more pure Sci-Fi, which, by the 90s was refreshing.

However the quality of the story telling was hit or miss. You can compare it to Tales From the Crypt, another Anthology from about the same time, or the Hitch Hiker, which were both solid for nearly every episode.

The 90s revival of the Outer Limits wasn't as solid. You had some episodes that would blow your hair back, some that would entertain and nothing else, and those were about equal to the ones that just kind of fell flat.

But, they didn't want to mix genres, they wanted to keep it more pure sci-fi, so it's hard to fault them for having so many misses in an Anthology series that tried so hard to stay true to the genre.",Kevin Conway,"kind place n't ? n't best show , 's moments moments come far better x-files . unlike twilight zone revivals lose moralistic bend , 90s revival sort bring back full swing make feel like twilight zone revival outer limit revival , let 's honest , outer limit kind continuation different name lean towards science fiction . also good job stay within genre science fiction something scarcely see show post alien start meld horror well . get less x-files pure sci-fi , , 90s refresh . however quality story tell hit miss . compare tales crypt , another anthology time , hitch hiker , solid nearly every episode . 90s revival outer limit n't solid . episodes would blow hair back , would entertain nothing else , equal ones kind fell flat . , n't want mix genres , want keep pure sci-fi , 's hard fault many miss anthology series try hard stay true genre .",1,1
1826,Strawberries With Sugar,"Drama, Comedy, Soap",5.6,"**A series with so many fans and detractors, which lasted for more than a decade, made so much money and started so many artistic careers, can only be considered a success. Despite this, it is a weak, uninteresting, tiring and very amateur series.**

This series, strongly aimed at teenagers, was created by TVI Channel, airing in prime time on weekdays. I think they were very inspired by *Malhação*, a similar series from Globo that was shown in Portugal through the TVI's rival channel SIC. The final formats of the series already have a certain influence of *High School Musical* and *Glee*. In any case, the series was a sure bet for the Queluz de Baixo TV channel: it acquired extraordinary popularity and guaranteed TVI the beginning of an audience supremacy that lasted for years. It also became a huge source of income for the channel, at the expense of advertising and massive merchandising.

The series appeared in 2003 and followed the lives of a group of school-aged teenagers from an elitist particular high school, Colégio da Barra. Each season ended with the end of the school year and gave way to a mini summer season. Each season there was a renewal of the cast and sometimes also a renewal of the environments: in the fifth season, the particular high school gives way to a public high school full of problems, which turns into a performing arts school in season 7 and disappears in season 9, to make way for another elite high school. In addition to the beach, flirting, extreme sports and teenage problems, the series dealt with deeper themes, from anorexia and bulimia, bullying or social prejudice. It also invested a lot in music, even giving rise to two teen bands. D'ZRT will be the most remembered: this boy's band was influenced by similar projects, such as Excesso and Backstreet Boys, and was very active until 2009.

Unsurprisingly, TVI bet on colossal and very mediatic castings to choose the actors for the various seasons. In the overwhelming majority, they had zero experience and were learning to act right there, in front of the cameras, so the quality level of the cast was extremely poor and those young people couldn't sound more forced and clumsy. Nevertheless, the series was a factory of young actors from which an entire generation of talents emerged, and which included João Catarré, Benedita Pereira, Cláudia Vieira, Pedro Teixeira, Joana Duarte, Luís Lourenço, Isaac Alfaiate, Mafalda Matos , Ângelo Rodrigues, Laura Galvão, Sara Matos, Lourenço Ortigão, David Carreira or Rui Andrade. Actors, models, TV hosts and musicians that often date and marry each other... after all, life often imitates art.

With so many mutations each season, it is understandable how the series maintained its strong ascendancy among young people until the end, in 2012. It was a huge success, making unconditional fans and also tireless detractors, who came to coin the terms “Morangos Generation” to refer to those who were teenagers between 2005 and 2010, and “morango-mania”, a derogatory allusion to the passionate way in which fans followed the series and consumed everything that related to it. Personally, I was never interested in the series. As I was one generation ahead of the so-called “Morangos Generation”, the series appeared when I was already a teenager, but even so, my interests never put me in the target audience. In fact, I was one of the biggest detractors of this series and “morango-mania” inside and outside my school! By forces superior to mine, I got to see a handful of loose episodes, from different seasons, and that's enough to give my opinions all the solidity: I was then able to verify that it was a sterile series with uninteresting stories, incapable of captivating the attention of more demanding audiences and populated by actors inexperienced to the point of bordering on amateurism. Even considering that it was TV material and that TVI was slow to throw money at the production, they were tiresome episodes, carelessly filmed and with sometimes ugly graphics, in addition to insisting on the most obvious clichés about what teenagers are or should be: beach, sports, flirtations and illusions. Everything has an end, this series has met its end, but it has not ceased to be noteworthy... and I believe it is still making some appearances on some cable channels.","Filipa Areosa, Marta Andrino, Eva Barros, Carla Salgueiro, Inês Costa","* * series many fan detractors , last decade , make much money start many artistic career , consider success . despite , weak , uninteresting , tire amateur series . * * series , strongly aim teenagers , create tvi channel , air prime time weekdays . think inspire * malhação * , similar series globo show portugal tvi 's rival channel sic . final format series already certain influence * high school musical * * glee * . case , series sure bet queluz de baixo tv channel : acquire extraordinary popularity guarantee tvi begin audience supremacy last years . also become huge source income channel , expense advertise massive merchandise . series appear 2003 follow live group school-aged teenagers elitist particular high school , colégio da barra . season end end school year give way mini summer season . season renewal cast sometimes also renewal environments : fifth season , particular high school give way public high school full problems , turn perform arts school season 7 disappear season 9 , make way another elite high school . addition beach , flirt , extreme sport teenage problems , series deal deeper theme , anorexia bulimia , bully social prejudice . also invest lot music , even give rise two teen band . d'zrt remember : boy 's band influence similar project , excesso backstreet boys , active 2009. unsurprisingly , tvi bet colossal mediatic castings choose actors various season . overwhelm majority , zero experience learn act right , front cameras , quality level cast extremely poor young people could n't sound force clumsy . nevertheless , series factory young actors entire generation talents emerge , include joão catarré , benedita pereira , cláudia vieira , pedro teixeira , joana duarte , luís lourenço , isaac alfaiate , mafalda matos , ângelo rodrigues , laura galvão , sara matos , lourenço ortigão , david carreira rui andrade . actors , model , tv host musicians often date marry ... , life often imitate art . many mutations season , understandable series maintain strong ascendancy among young people end , 2012. huge success , make unconditional fan also tireless detractors , come coin term “ morangos generation ” refer teenagers 2005 2010 , “ morango-mania ” , derogatory allusion passionate way fan follow series consume everything relate . personally , never interest series . one generation ahead so-called “ morangos generation ” , series appear already teenager , even , interest never put target audience . fact , one biggest detractors series “ morango-mania ” inside outside school ! force superior mine , get see handful loose episodes , different season , 's enough give opinions solidity : able verify sterile series uninteresting stories , incapable captivate attention demand audiences populate actors inexperienced point border amateurism . even consider tv material tvi slow throw money production , tiresome episodes , carelessly film sometimes ugly graphics , addition insist obvious clichés teenagers : beach , sport , flirtations illusions . everything end , series meet end , cease noteworthy ... believe still make appearances cable channel .",1,1

1848,Westworld,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Western",8.044,"This show is a sort of what-if:  what if highly advanced robots were developed, ostensibly to populate a theme park?  Different characters react according to their personalities.   To Dr. Ford  (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who keeps a copy of Michelangelo's CREATION OF ADAM in his office, it is the creation of a new species.  To Bernard Lowe, it is a fascinating experiment to take his mind off personal tragedy.  To the pompous writer Sizemore, it is a new artform as he composes narratives for the robots to carry out.  To visitors William and Logan it is wish-fulfillment, whether it is William's search for love or Logan's vulgar thrill-seeking.  To Theresa, it is just a business, and she complains that Dr. Ford's attempts to making robots more lifelike and unpredictable will eat into profits.   The robots themselves, who are supposedly rebooted after each ""show"", aren't supposed to think or feel anything -- but they are starting to do so. 

The show has numerous artistic references -- Dr. Ford's Michelangelo painting, the logo parodying Da Vinci's ""Vitruvian Man"" drawing,  Debussy's REVERIE, plus references to old-fashioned Westerns.

Original Review
(based on the season's first four episodes handed to press)
HBO hit a massive fail with the final season of Game of Thrones, but their quality regarding TV shows didn't seem to suffer from that. Westworld is one of HBO's biggest/best series, and in my opinion, it's the one that currently occupies the throne that GOT ruled for years. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy created an extremely complex narrative, filled with mind-blowing twists, and truly remarkable character-building. Season three promised to be totally different, having in mind last season's game-changing finale, so expectations are undoubtedly very high...

While it's true that Westworld packs jaw-dropping twists, the previous seasons differ from one another concerning this aspect. In season one, the twists serve the story, but in the second one, it felt like the story was serving the twists. This resulted in a few ""less great"" episodes due to the loss of tension and of well-balanced pacing, occasionally losing the interest of its viewers. In addition to this, most twists were so foreshadowed that the last few episodes lacked that powerful punch to knock us out.

Season three goes back to basics. Last season's finale works almost like a reboot of the series regarding its environment, rules, and even characters. Most of the series is set in the real world so far, but there are a few sequences in familiar places. Dolores' plan seems simple, but since this is Westworld, the last half of the season will probably provide a few surprises, so keep your eyes wide open.

I can't really delve into what each character is doing, but according to the trailers, writing that Bernard and Maeve have an essential role in this season shouldn't come as a shock. Both possess two very intriguing arcs, and I'm definitely interested in knowing how they will connect to Dolores' storyline. Aaron Paul's Caleb doesn't have that much screentime in the first four episodes. Nevertheless, he receives a well-written backstory, and his subplot not only tells the audience everything about him, but it also shows how the real world works.

My biggest compliment to the first half of this season is about each episode's structure. Every single episode starts and ends with something impactful. Each time I started one, I was instantly captivated by what was happening, and every ending left me with an extreme curiosity to watch the next one. Fortunately, I had the ""next episode"" button, but it will definitely be interesting to see how fans will react to weeks of waiting for the next (great) episode. Throughout each chapter, the story flows naturally without those confusing, exaggerated, twistful narratives of season two.

So far, it's a pretty straightforward main plot, but the unsolved mysteries still carry that aura of unpredictability, which makes season three a perfect structure to deliver a phenomenal, shocking finale. The acting continues to be top-notch with everyone just giving their all. So far, my standouts are Tessa Thompson (Charlotte Hale) and Evan Rachel Wood. Ed Harris (William) also delivers an outstanding display, but the two women are unbelievably good, especially Thompson. Technically, the episodes were still a work in progress, but the production and visual quality of HBO are impressive as always.

All in all, Westworld returns with a perfect season's structure to blow every fan's mind away once again. The real world looks incredible, every character gets a very intriguing story, but the first and last few minutes of each episode are absolutely fantastic. Each chapter instantly grabs the viewer's attention, and the ending leaves everyone craving for the next episode. Tessa Thompson is the absolute standout, but Evan Rachel Wood continues to prove her impressive acting skills. Aaron Paul should have more screentime in the last half of the season, but so far, both he and Caleb are pretty great. Excellent pacing, brilliant tension-building regarding the central mystery, and wonderfully-written dialogues. Four episodes, nothing truly negative to point out. Hoping for a second-half as great or better than the first.","Evan Rachel Wood, Thandiwe Newton, Jeffrey Wright, Tessa Thompson, Aaron Paul","enjoy read spoiler-free review , please follow blog @ https : //www.msbreviews.com original review ( base season 's first four episodes hand press ) hbo hit massive fail final season game throne , quality regard tv show n't seem suffer . westworld one hbo 's biggest/best series , opinion , 's one currently occupy throne get rule years . jonathan nolan lisa joy create extremely complex narrative , fill mind-blowing twist , truly remarkable character-building . season three promise totally different , mind last season 's game-changing finale , expectations undoubtedly high ...

1934,Lupin The Third,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.1,"*PART 1 REVIEW* - *8/10* *(Dubbed)*

the thing i don't like about the treatment of Lupin the Third on here is that all the shows are compiled into one and I can't review each show individually, so I'' just have to make due and make multiple reviews on this one compiled page. 

This isn't actually the first time I've seen this, back last April, I watched it subbed because i wanted to binge the whole franchise, but the more i thought about it it became more of a pipe dream because I was already doing my Scooby-Doo marathon at the same time and doing two at once would be to much, so I stopped when I started to watch the first few episodes of Part 2. I finished the Scooby-Doo franchise by new years and i wanted to restart my ""Lupin-a-thon"". To change it up on rewatch, i watched the new dub that came out last year and I think I like the show better on rewatch. The dub itself is really good, even if it clashed with the crusty old soundtrack a tiny bit

Well. it was great. I'm kinda surprised how much this shoe just works for me this time around. The characters are just beyond charming in their own ways. Lupin is such  a fun lead and I always love watching all his brilliant schemes come to throughition while also being a joy to watch. Jigen is the weakest character out of the main 5, but not a bad one by any means, he is a real character with a fun personality, but i feel like his expert gunman skills are barely used at all through part 1. I like Fujiko quite a bit, Her manipulative and seductive nature  was enjoyable and I liked seeing Lupin constantly simp for her and usually falls into her manipulation, but the show really liked her being in very precarious situations where shes constantly being being show as the sexual appeal of the show and not much else, but fortunately they phased some of that out towards the later half of the series and we could enjoy her character more. Goemon is cool as heck, I love seeing this somewhat enemy eventually become an alley for the Lupin Gang and used his insane skills to help with fun heists. You could question why a samurai would be help Lupin be a thief, but it makes total sense because the people he look up to in his life his master and ""girlfriend"" didn't really care for him and Lupin was the first real alley to him, so it makes sense from that standpoint. Zenigata is probably the funniest character in the whole shoe. I just can't help but be entertained by this desperate Inspector   dedicating hos whole life just capturing this one dude and it's so good. I am jealous of his comedic timing sometimes, *especially* for episode 23, which he was hilarious and it still holds up 50 years later. 

some of the aspects I want to praise is it's animation. I mean by modern standards, it doesn't look amazing, but for 1971 TV standards, it goes over and beyond. I mean this was made when Scooby-Doo just debuted and Disney Animation were still making movies like ""Aristocats"" and ""Robin Hood"" and this little show from Japan that came out on a weekly   basis is more expressive and lively than any of those products I listed previously. And the quality honestly never drops and I can't really call any of these episodes bad, that said, I do still have problems. Like for instance, it's tone. The show has a mix between serious episodes with high stakes and not so serious episodes with fun heists. Both of them work on their own, but as a whole, it just clashes too hard and there's not really an overall consistent tone. I can't stress enough that both of these tones work, it's just putting these wildly different tones together creates tonal whiplash. Having a fun and quirky heist in one episode and then immediately follow that up something extremely serious makes for a confusing and muddled tone. But as individual episodes, I liked both equally. I liked  seeing those really serious, especially Episode 9 and 11, becasue those episodes really Lupin's true character. Lupin is a thief, not a murderer. He kills people, yes, but those are always people from rival gangs who want to kill him and never innocent  people or police. Like he puts himself out there to save Fujiko in a really desperate situation because he does really care for her outside of the usual flirtatious manner. and that especially goes for episode 11, where Lupin is put into a situation where a random girl's life at stake and he does want to save her regardless if he even knows her, which does a lot about his character. You could make the argument that he tied up a bunch of girls in suitcases in episode 18, but he only did that to frame other bad dudes and he probably wouldn't of even done that if he wasn't absolutely sure that Inspector Zenigata would get involved. He's a Phantom Thief with a , not a murderer and that's something I can respect. The more fun episodes that *Studio Ghibli founders* Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata directed are delights, they don't have that as much substance compared to the mature Masaaki Ōsumi episodes, but they they can be really fun, especially episodes like 13, 15, and 23 of course. a problem I have with it's western release is the titles of the episodes, there not pure translations and I hate it, but it's not the show's fault. the best example of this is with Episode 21's title ""Rescue the Shrewish Girl"" was changed to ""Rescue the Tomboy!"" or ""Rescue of the Stubborn Tomboy""!for English audiences. I don't know about you, but the words ""Shrewish"" and ""Tomboy"" do not mean the same thing and the word ""Tomboy"" doesn't fit the description of the girl that Lupin rescues and ""Shrewish"" fits her perfectly and the girl isn't boyish, so I don't really get the thought process of that name change. And I'm at it, the villain in Episode 21 is a bit one note, and English title doesn't really fit regardless of how funny it may be, but Lupin slapping her in the face was based because she is a bit annoying and too oblivious to an extent. 

Well, that's Part 1! I'm glad I rewatched it because it only got better and it was only 23 episodes, so it wasn't even a chore to get through it all. It definitely has it's growing pains to work out and overall muddled tone, but it was a really great watch that still holds up 50 years later and I can't wait to watch more of this enjoyable franchise

1934,Lupin The Third,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.1,"*PART 2 REVIEW* - *7/10* *(1-79;145/155 Dubbed)* 
*(80-144;146-154 Subbed)*

This review has been a loooooooong time coming, This was the biggest roadblock trying to watch all the Lupin the Third media. I really want to get to the TV Specials and I especially want to get to all the 2010s Lupin media, but I'm not at the 2010s yet, but I know I'll get to those eventually. Like watching Lupin: Part 2 had almost became a daily routine for almost 2 months, THIS IS NOT A JOKE!!! From March 8th to April 30, I grinded this show so much. Like I knew the longer I procrastinated on it, the longer it would be to actually move on from it, so I just sucked it up and I got really impatient about it because I wanted to get it over with. I'm making it sound  like I hated this show, which I don't at all, this is an very entertaining show, it's just mild frustrating from a binging standpoint and not the quality of the show itself 

On the point of it's quality, it's shocking by how consistent it is throughout over 150 episodes. Sure, they're were a few episodes I didn't like, but that's the key word, *""few""*. The episode I consider to be at the bottom of the barrel of this show isn't something I genuinely hate, it's just one where the butt of the joke wears super thin and isn't funny or charming, it's just lame. That's super impressive taking into account it's overall length and the fact that it's one of the longest shows I've seen in it's entirety with the other ones currently being TMNT (1987) and TMNT (2003). The tonal problems I had with Part 1 aren't present in Part 2, and for the most part it's the same tone throughout with the only exceptions being the two Miyazaki episodes which I already talked about them thoroughly on Lettorboxd under ""Lupin the Third: Greatest Capers"" if your interested. The tone is a lot more lighthearted and fun compared to Part 1's more mature and thought out plot lines. Part 2 pulls back on the amount of gun violence and killing, but it's still present, just not as much as Part 1. What *is* here, though, is an absurd amount of exposed breasts shots. Yeah, this show is obsessed with boobs and 99.9% of the time it's just there because they just could and it doesn't add anything expect fan-service. Lupin is *way* more perverted in this show than he was in Part 1 and while, yes, the original manga was way more darker than Part 1 and had plenty of nudity in it, the subject matter fits with the overall mature tone of the manga. With Part 2's more lighthearted nature, it comes off as immature and it makes me feel I'm back in Middle School again where everybody that this kind of stuff was cool which it really wasn't. It's obnoxious whenever it just  up and ruins a potentially good episode, but I guess at some point I stop caring. The characters are different *enough* for me to reiterate my thoughts on them. Lupin is a really fun and energetic lead with his energetic and playful nature being a lot more prevalant in this show than it was in Part 1 with, again, because of the less serious tone. Fujiko is still pretty much the same from Part 1, but she's a lot more often paired up with the Lupin Gang despite Jigen and Goemon's constant protest against that, but Lupin is too much of a simp to listen, only for Lupin to keep getting double crossed by Fujiko and those episodes usually have 1 of 4 endings. Lupin wins, Fujiko wins, everybody wins, or nobody wins. Lupin is the most common while the Fujiko winning is the least common. Goemon is more or less the same character as Part 1, but more restricted on what he actually cuts with his sword, and you'd be hard pressed to find a moment where he actually cuts someone in half in this show. Jigen is a lot more cooler than he was in Part 1, they use his sharpshooting skills way more than Part 1 and he actually has episodes from his perspective and I'd argue that the Jigen episodes some of the most compelling with the a some of the Goemon episodes a behind them. Zenigata is honestly peak-Zenigata in this show. The more lighthearted tone actually works in his favor and he's so enjoyable in this one.

The animation is obviously an improvement over Part 1 and  it's kind of impressive for this to be released on a weekly basis. I like Part 2's more timeless jazzy soundtrack while Part 1's soundtrack is a lot more 70s, but both fit each individual's style. Most of the episodes fall under the 7/10 range, while compared to Part 1 where the amount of good and great episodes were equally balance with no real bad episode to speak of. Part 2 is a lot more hit or miss. A hand full of episodes are great, a whole bunch as just good with not a lot to talk about them, some are just okay, and the very few that I think that are mediocre, but like I said at the beginning of this review, it's impressive how consistent the quality it is despite a few hiccups along the road

You'd expect for me to have a lot more to say about the show after 155 episodes, but there's not usually to much to say about episodic series because it's not story driven, it's just ""The heist of the week"" kinda thing and  that's perfectly fine. But I guess I'll talk about the dub

The dub of *half* of this show might just slap harder than the actual than the actual show itself. Tony Oliver is the perfect English iteration of Lupin encompassing all his goofy charm and can get serious whenever to story needs him too. Richard Epcar is also my favorite English Jigen because he perfectly recaptures Kiyoshi Kobayashi's original performance in English forms with his own to charm. Lex Lang is like my definitive English Goemon while Michelle Ruff is my definitive Fujiko *PERIOD*. Yeah, I think I'm seeing a trend with this specific voice cast. Dan Lorge is a bit of a weird one. Like yeah he is great as Zenigata, but this alongside the Geneon dub of Mystery of Mamo are the only Lupin projects he was apart of I think I might prefer Doug Erholtz's performance a bit more making him my favorite English Zenigata. But this dub doesn't get hundreds of thousands of views on Youtube *just* because of the great cast, it gets watched because of the tweaks to the script to add an extra modern flair and some pop culture references. And this is an extreme rarity where these kinds of changes *unironically* work. It genuinely adds so much charm and memorability to the original source material. They could of just adapted scripts as is without any changes, but it wouldn't be the time. If you want to watch the show, watch the dub because you be missing something if you didn't. The dub is hilarious with a great voice cast and it knows when it have more dramatic beats when it needs to. I'm sad that only *half* of the show was dub because Geneon lost the rights to keep going, but I'm more than glad that we get at least half the show like this. 

That's really it, sure I have thoughts on individual episodes, but I don't wanna drag out this review longer than it needs to be because I want to watch Lupin: Part 3 by tomorrow, so see yeah my Lupin: Part 3 review

1934,Lupin The Third,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.1,"*PART 3 REVIEW* - *7/10* *(Subbed)*

Compared to the 2 month period that took me to watch Lupin: Part II, which took me about 2 months, it only really took 9 days to watch all 50 episodes of this show, which compared to the length of Part II, is a breath of fresh air because I didn't feel like it was getting tedious. Note, this is the only mainline Lupin show that does not have a dub made in any capacity which, yeah, it is kinda ironic that the show that uses Western culture so much _never_ actually received an official English localization. I'd love to see the Tony Oliver cast eventually dub this, but watching the sub wasn't too bad.

I was fully going into this show expecting it just to be okay because I felt that it wouldn't be saying much in the franchise compared to Part I and Part II, and while that is true to an extent, but it surprised me by actually being good. I don't think it's as dramatically driven as Part I or as funny and unpredictable as Part II, but what it does is very good. I heard this was considered the black sheep of the Lupin shows and I didn't see that at first, but the more I watch through the show, I think it's because it doesn't have that much of a personality. Part I and Part II have personality, but this show is kinda... more of the same and I don't want to bash on it too hard because a lot of the individual episodes are good, but the question ""What separates it from the rest of the pack?"" Well, the best I could come up with is towards the later half of the show, they phased out a lot of the mature aspects (like the breasts shots) and now use wacky, slapstick animation which I actually quite like. It's basically Part 1's tonal identity problems all over again, but slightly less egregious. Some episodes can get really goofy and I usually like those episodes. Overall the quality is somewhat consistent throughout, which is mostly in that 7/10 area, but there aren't a lot of great episodes. The only episodes I would give that 8/10 to are Episodes 6, 30, and 37. 'cause those episodes say ""Hey, let's actually try to tell a compelling story with these characters while also being very enjoyable"". What I noticed is that there's a noticeable lack of specific character-driven episodes. There are a few Jigen episodes and a tiny bit of Goemon episodes, but there aren't as many as Lupin: Part II. There's not a lot to talk about with the characters because they're mostly just the same as Part II, except for the slight design changes. The early episodes have this more ""realistic humanoid"" style which I'm not too big on, and of course, the aforementioned wacky, silly style that I actually am a fan of. The only character designs that are worth talking about are Jigen's and Zenigata's. Jigen in the ""realistic humanoid"" style I don't really like. They take away the fact that his hat goes over his eyes which takes away from his defining design feature that tells you what kind of character he is IMP, but they give him the hat droop back in the ""wacky, goofy, silly"" style. I also really like Zenigata's design in this show, which only really rivals his Mystery of Mamo's design (Pre-Part III), but I don't exactly have much to say after that. I guess thinking about it as a whole, there’s just not a lot calling me back to this as much as Part I or Part II and while the majority of episodes are solid as is, not much really stuck with me in the long run.

I mean... yeah, I don't have that much to say about it overall because it's not story-driven, it's episodic. It's surprisingly good for what it is, but it obviously is the weakest out of the original three shows

1951,The King Dae Joyoung,Drama,4.8,"The drama was infested with cheap drama/melodrama tactics to keep it alive for too goddamn very long 134 episodes because otherwise it can't reach that milestone. Which turned it into a mind melting irritating watch. These details were highly unlikely to be historically accurate. Looking back at it I don't recall a lot of big events/moments happened during these 134 episodes, it feels empty for what it tried to achieve. The bothersome experience doesn't stop here but extends to its production also as if that wasn't enough. About +80% of the entire filmed footage were extreme face close ups. You're most certainly guaranteed to feel nauseous being subject to that for too long. My guess is that it was done purposefully to hide the background and cut on the budget.

1958,Tokyo Ghoul,"Animation, Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.3,"With as few spoilers as possible, ghouls look just like humans but they eat them. As one would expect, these ghouls are quite strong and their origins are a mystery - similar to vampires in other stories. The major difference being that people are very aware of ghoulish existence.

As with many stories, this introduces an introverted, whiny weakling who is thrust in the midst of the ghoul world. Many things then start happening and it seems like the author or (if the anime strays from the manga) producer loses track of things and doesn't tie up loose ends.

The transition from the second into the third season is abrupt and most characters are just referenced to later on. Many things remain unexplained as major characters were introduced throughout the second and quite big reveals are made at the end. The reasons for the main characters action however, stay shrouded in a veil of pseudo-psychological justifications.

The unfinished story aside, the animations are crisp and well-done, and the story has a good pace, but I couldn't bring myself to watch past the first episodes of season 3. The disconnect was and lingering questions were very annoying.

A very good anime for people who like theory-crafting, but for those without that time on their hands who want a nice bow on a story, skip this.","Natsuki Hanae, Sora Amamiya, Shintaro Asanuma, Takahiro Sakurai, Sumire Morohoshi","spoilers possible , ghouls look like humans eat . one would expect , ghouls quite strong origins mystery - similar vampires stories . major difference people aware ghoulish existence . many stories , introduce introvert , whiny weakling thrust midst ghoul world . many things start happen seem like author ( anime stray manga ) producer lose track things n't tie loose end . transition second third season abrupt character reference later . many things remain unexplained major character introduce throughout second quite big reveal make end . reason main character action however , stay shroud veil pseudo-psychological justifications . unfinished story aside , animations crisp well-done , story good pace , could n't bring watch past first episodes season 3. disconnect linger question annoy . good anime people like theory-crafting , without time hand want nice bow story , skip .",1,1
1968,Shōgun,"Drama, War & Politics",8.5,"The original Shogun, the series, from 1980 like the novel it was based upon,by James Clavell, was a masterpiece. 

It worked because of tight coherent storytelling, compelling characterisations and intelligent narrative, that very wisely took its inspiration and direction, from the novel it was based upon. 

Then along lumbers this latest effort. Its manages to partly shift its focus away from the relationship between the pilot John Blackthorne and Lord Toranaga. In so doing, diffusing a key focal point of the story. A story which is essentially about the collision of Western and Eastern societies and cultures, which resonates in this period of Japanese history and beyond. 

The other key aspect of the original story that no longer works as well, was one of ultimately tragic love between Blackthorne and Lady Mariko. Mariko is a courtier who relies on her skill as a negotiator, to influence those around her. We see this clearly in the book and the original series. 

Instead, we now get a shift towards female warriors, which might reflect modern expectations but not those of Japan in the 1600's. Yes, there were female warriors in this period but they were not courtiers, trained in the art of diplomacy. Their role was in defence of the home, when male Samurai were absent or had fallen in battle, guarding women at court and at times, they were found on the battlefield.

Suffice to say, the new revised Mariko is anything but diplomatic. She rebukes male Samurai in the opening episode in the way that is jarringly and unconvincingly, at odds, with the talents, that define this character who is able to delicately and intricately navigate the conspiracies and intrigue, of courtly life.

The result is a series that feels clumsy and monotonous but also rather ignorant. The narrative in many cases does not work well, because the new series has discarded many of the subtleties and intrigue inherent in this tale, that are as much a weapon of the Japanese nobles, as the spear, bow and sword.    

Acting in this series is excellent, sets admittedly amazing and visuals  often spectacular. Regrettably the degree of meddling in the underlying story, for this reviewer, ruins what could have been, a promising updated series. 

In summary. Lavish sets, stunning visuals and quality acting can't overcome flawed, revisionist storytelling. The result feels awkward, unbalanced and lacking in coherence and direction.

1968,Shōgun,"Drama, War & Politics",8.5,"Shogun is the new benchmark for epic television.

In the realm of historical dramas, FX's ""Shogun"" stands tall as a monumental achievement in television. The series, an adaption of James Clavell's beloved novel, will no doubt be met with acclaim for it's riveting performances, exceptional writing, and meticulous attention to cultural (and historical) authenticity.

The 1980s adaptation of ""Shogun"" was a product of its time, focusing heavily on the character of Anjin, the English navigator. While it was a remarkable piece of television for its era, it deviated from the novel's core narrative by sidelining Yoshii Toranaga, the enigmatic power player in feudal Japan. The 2024 series corrects this course, placing Toranaga at the center of the narrative, and the series is all the better for that.

""Shogun"" 2024 is a standout even in what many consider the golden age of television epics. It's been compared to HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" but ""Shogun"" carves out its own identity with a more focused narrative and a refined storytelling approach. The series does not shy away from depicting the era's inherent violence and sensuality, yet it does so with a sophistication that sets it apart, akin to the artful precision of sashimi versus the hearty mix of a stew.

The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, elevating ""Shogun"" to new heights. Hiroyuki Sanada, renowned for his role in ""The Last Samurai,"" embodies the master strategist warlord Toranaga with an intensity that captivates the audience. Sanada's portrayal is nuanced, oscillating between menacing and endearing, showcasing a range that few actors achieve.

Cosmo Jarvis's portrayal of the English sailor Anjin is less compelling. His character's journey from a shipwrecked outsider to a pivotal chess piece in the political machinations of feudal Japan is portrayed with an raw energy. Of the main cast, he falls into the background to an extent but his scenes with brilliant Tadanobu Asano's Yabushige are great. Both characters are more antagonists than protagonists but I doubt they'll outlive their welcome to most viewers.

However, it is Anna Sawai who delivers the truly standout performance. Known for her roles in ""Fast and the Furious"" and Apple TV's ""Pachinko,"" Sawai shines as both the translator for Anjin and the audience's guide through the intricate world of ""Shogun."" Her character is not merely a conduit for understanding; she is integral to the unfolding events, leaving an indelible mark on the series.

""Shogun"" 2024 is a triumph of storytelling, a testament to the power of well-crafted historical drama. It is a series that not only respects its source material but also elevates it. This is a series that will be remembered and celebrated, a jewel in the crown of television's current golden age. We may not know it yet, but this series might well be it's peak.

1968,Shōgun,"Drama, War & Politics",8.5,"Shogun is a miniseries produced by FX, based on the famous 1975 novel of the same name. With a first season of 10 episodes, I can only applaud and appreciate the privilege of witnessing such a well-made production, with a fascinating script and an impressive setting.

The series follows the adventure of John Blackthorne, an English pilot who shipwrecks with his crew in Japan in 1600. This story serves as a thread to immerse ourselves in a sea of intrigues, betrayals, and power struggles between the fiefs over the future of the nation.

The series carefully presents the cultural conflict faced by the Portuguese people in their mission of evangelization in Japan. In addition, it shows us the severity, the courage and a concept of honor that sometimes seemed uncomfortable and impressive to me. The respect for families, the honor of the legacy, and the excellent female roles in a raw and masculine world, sometimes provoke the desire to stand up and applaud.

After experiencing years of fatigue from Marvel & DC, along with pervasive Hollywood trends and tiresome moral lectures in entertainment, I have finally discovered something original, unapologetic, and genuinely captivating.

This series is a refreshing change, offering a tightly woven storyline, brilliant acting, meticulously chosen dialogues, stunning cinematography, excellent pacing, and masterful editing and direction. It exceeded all my expectations.

The female characters exemplify strength and bravery. Mariko Sama’s fight in episode 9 still gives me goosebumps—it's one of the most courageous scenes ever created.

Maybe I feel this because I watched the whole series too fast (May 6th, 2021 ~ May 31st, 2021). Although, I still feel it was too fast and short. This series has become one of my favorite anime!

I watched the whole series on Crunchyroll. I was so annoyed by the advertisement for SAO while watching another anime on CR, however, I liked the animation pictures (I love _A-1 Picture_'s anime haha). That was my trigger. 

I know there are complaints about the story; even my sister did. I half forced her to watch this series just because I wanted to share my excitement (ahh, bad brother...). Although, luckily, she was also enjoying the series up until season 2. I know there was a major turning point in the middle of season 1. I remember I was also the one who didn't have a good review for season 2 (although it was always over 3.5/5).

But I really don't know how better it could be. I was first thinking that the Aincrad arc should have been longer; however, after watching until Alicization War of Underground, I think it was the right length. I might have stopped watching the whole series.

I usually don't watch these ""fighting"" or ""action"" anime, instead, I watch more romcom and comedy. That is why maybe I have a different perspective than others who usually watch this kind of anime. But now, after watching every SAO episode I can watch, I feel I lost something big in my heart that was holding myself these days. I really hope I can watch the next movie (""_Progressive_"") before this feeling goes away.

In this case it might have been a combination of all three elements.

I am really enjoying the show. It is funny and dramatic in turns, and very edgy in its plots and presentation. Sometimes it goes perhaps pushes the envelope a bit too far. One example is a corrupt character introduced in the fourth season. I tired of him quickly. It felt to me the actor was “doing” Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman. But these excesses are all in the pursuit of a story told well.

2149,1923,"Drama, Western",8.1,"I'm sorry for the loss of what could have been an excellent show. But some things bother me. But first positive things. Most of the main actors are very good, the landscapes are beautiful, and the period is also something that I personally just like to see.

The first problem that I have is with bashing Christianity and the catholic church, which is in my mind completely exaggerated and takes too much space in this show. In this show nuns and priests are portrayed worse than the mafia or KKK. I'm not religious, it's just portrayed misleadingly bad over the top. I'm not American and I have great respect for the Indigenous people of America (whom we just call Indians) and the great loss of life, land, and culture they suffered but blaming the Catholic church for that is just a lie. Also, the actress playing Teonna is very unlikable and irritating.

The second problem with the show is that some scenes are prolonged too much, like most of the love scenes. I just had to fast-forward such scenes because I became bored.

Third is a skewed view of right and wrong created in the show by the creators of this show. The main character hanging five people is OK, he just had to do it, killing a bunch of nuns and priests is OK to do as it is ""eating the soul"" of one priest (which is just cannibalism). Worse than all that is beating those girls in Catholic school are getting? I agree is horrible, but no worse than what 'good' guys and girls in the show are doing. But even that is not the point. The point is that that whole segment with the Indian girl and her reason for running away from school is too long, a lot too long, and unnecessary. Not to mention that in the whole season we didn't see even a hint of why is she and her story important. Everything that was happening with her could have been explained in 5 minutes. And that is the same problem with this show as stated before.

2163,Homecoming,Drama,7.0,"**Review of Season 2**

Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/u9pZGjxHK7c

Season 2 of _Homecoming_ recently arrived on Amazon Video. I had no idea there was a second season coming, but having thoroughly enjoyed the first, this was really good news. 

Season 2 picks up soon after the end of the previous season and takes off at a sprint. We meet a character called Alex who wakes up in a rowboat in the middle of a lake and we go from there. The connection to Geist, the company at the heart of season 1, is established early, and we are right there with her as she tries to figure things out. It’s one of those shows that keeps you in the dark and makes you work it out as you go along. It uses flashbacks that overlap with the previous season to fill in blanks here and there, and it all comes off as a great package. 

The season is well written and one of the things in particular that I liked was that just when you think you have it all figured out, they pull the rug from under you. Things they show you at one point make you think one thing, then are later shown that they are completely different. It’s a great style that kept us interested all the way through. 

Like the first season, this second one has less than 10 episodes, and they are all around the 30min mark. So if you like twisting turning stories with lots of surprises, now’s a good time to get on board.","Janelle Monáe, Stephan James, Chris Cooper, Hong Chau","* * review season 2 * * click video version review : https : //youtu.be/u9pzgjxhk7c season 2 _homecoming_ recently arrive amazon video . idea second season come , thoroughly enjoy first , really good news . season 2 pick soon end previous season take sprint . meet character call alex wake rowboat middle lake go . connection geist , company heart season 1 , establish early , right try figure things . ’ one show keep dark make work go along . use flashbacks overlap previous season fill blank , come great package . season well write one things particular like think figure , pull rug . things show one point make think one thing , later show completely different . ’ great style keep us interest way . like first season , second one less 10 episodes , around 30min mark . like twist turn stories lot surprise , ’ good time get board .",1,1

Randy Jackson was a music mogul, an individual who played for Mariah Carey, and a legend in his own right. Paula Abdul music icon from the 80s, one of the biggest selling artist and amazing choreographers ever to step foot on a stage. And then Simon Cowell, the ruthless, aggressive and honest individual that America fell in love with. And has went on to become one of the Biggest Music executive directors in the world.

I’m going to captivate all seasons in this one review, so this is going to be a long one, so enjoy. 

Season one, what an incredible journey, a show that you did not think was going to last let alone become such a mega hit that it became. But more importantly, you had to have the right winner. With America voting did we get the right winner? America selected the quiet yet powerful vocals of Kelly Clarkson. Kelly Clarkson went on to solidify the show as a mega superpower. When she became a Grammy award-winning artist, television actress, movie actress, and she is now has a syndicated talk show. Kelly Clarkson went on to sell millions of albums, worldwide and even placed, second place in Idol against all the other idol competitions around the world.

Season two was the biggest controversial season we saw to date trying to follow up with the success of the first season, we awarded Ruben Studdard, the winner of American idol with a bunch of controversy, whether or not Clay Aiken should’ve been the one to go onto the show. Either way, both men came out of the successful and not only did the two men come out successful. Kimberly called well became in Household, hosting and becoming an actress.

Season three delivered Fantasia Barrino, one of the most underrated incredible voices in the world. Her voice is so unique and iconic. She went onto also become a Grammy award winner and best selling R&B artist. She also stemmed Jennifer Hudson and Oscar winning and Grammy winning artist as well from that season who plays seventh place. This showed American idol was not just focused on the winner, but the people from the top 12 also had an opportunity to become super successful. From the season alone we also got Deanna Degarmo who went to become a Broadway legend.. 

Season four, we got the greatest and legendary country singer in Carrie Underwood. She brought the fire and tore that season apart. She was a young lady who did not know anything and never had been on a plane. To go on and become a multi time, Grammy award winning artist and mega power, and now she sits at the table as one of the judges for American idol. 

Season five became the new controversy, after season two and season three brought us severe controversy season five hit us even harder. Taylor Hicks took home the title of American Idol during this season, and ended up failing as a credible winner. Not being able to hold up to the four before him. All four artists before him either are Grammy winners or Grammy nominated artist. Taylor could not live up to those expectations and standards. His fourth finisher Chris Daughtry went to be a Grammy award-winning rockstar. Which is the person everyone thought was going to win this show. Catherine McVie became an actress and Elliott Yamin pulled out a great singing career as well. we also got the Grammy award winning Christian artist Mandisa, and we got country artist of Bucky Covington and country superstar Kellie Pickler. Season five may have had the wrong winner, but it had the most incredible group of top 12. 

Season six, we got NFL football players, daughter Jordon Sparks as the winner youngest winner at that time. She went on to become also a Grammy nominated artist, keeping the trend alive that success can come from the show. We also got the boxing talents of Blake Lewis, and a few other individuals who stemmed from the show, but didn’t make it to the superstardom level.

Season seven we started to the show out with one of the most incredible finale battles. We’ve seen in a long time David versus David , two different individuals. One rocker and one gospel singer. The older David, David Cook came out on top as he prevailed the rocker of the season. He went on to sell multiple albums, but still never reached the stardom of five of his predecessors. He still had a very successful career, but it was never a megastar career.

During our season, eight journey, American idol decided to spice things up by adding a fourth judge. Kara Diaguardi and she brought a lot of controversy between Simon and herself. After seven years of being the three they are now the four. Kris Allen captured the title of season eight, with one of the most controversial wins of all time. Front runner and expected winner. Adam Lambert went on to become a star in his own right, but was believed to be the actual winner of the show. But America was not ready for an LGBT winner. Especially someone who was completely open about their sexuality. Now American Idol served a little differently than it normally did you may have got a few people to have minor success after the show. But by this time, if you weren’t the winner, you barely got any success afterwards and that didn’t even mean if you got success. Unfortunately, he may have won the competition but he did just as bad as the previous winner from season five.

We move onto season nine still with the same set of judges, Lee Dewyze wins the title in the most forgettable, unsuccessful, and unpopular season ever. America was not fond of the singer, songwriter, crooner season, that transpired from dispatch. The only thing we got from this was gospel singer Colton Dixon, which to be honest with you, he might’ve actually came from a different season, they also attempted to spice things up just a little more, by replacing longtime judge Paula Abdul with Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen did not work out, she hated everything about judging people, and quit the show immediately after.

Season 10, we return to a three judges panel. With Ellen DeGeneres quitting and American idol not renewing Kara‘s contract, and then Simon Cowell exiting the show. We were left up in the air with the judges panel. They brought on Steven Tyler from Aerosmith and Latin legend, Jennifer Lopez. This season saw the winner of Scotty McCreery, who went on to become a country superstar, but not only that he also was the first in a long time where the runner-up went on to be a country superstar in Lauren Alaina. America and American idol were back on top.

We moved into season 11 with the same judges Randy, Jennifer,Steven and what a group they turned out to be, funny and hilarious and great judges. We saw the coronation of Philip Phillips, who went on to have one of the greatest singles of all time. And even had it as the Olympics theme song for that year. Philip had struggled afterwards to captivate and connect with the audience. Which put him in the same boat as Taylor, David, Kris and Lee. But the American Idol team was helpful.

We moved on to season 12 this season saw the departure of Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez as judges. And brought in Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey. Unfortunately, for this season, Nikki and Mariah could not get along. The fighting, the continued arguments and bantering back-and-forth, took away from the contestants, and took away from their singing, and what the competition in the show was all about, and it turned into a dramatic all out mess. This season we got the winner of Candice Glover, who went on to do nothing, she became one of those forgotten winners, and one of the most failed American Idol winner of all time at this moment. She did release an album, but it failed on the charts. And it was because I believe the focus was off of these individuals and more on the dramatics of the judges. So nobody grew to love them like you did the previous winners.

So we went on to season 14 of American Idol. At this time, American Idol did not invite Nick or Mariah back, and Randy Jackson decided to part ways. The company brought back Jennifer Lopez to join Keith Urban and then brought on Harry Connick Junior, these three became the saving Grace of at least the judges panel. But it was too late for the show. The show kept these judges for the next three seasons. This season we saw the winner Caleb Johnson who took Candice‘s spot as the worst American Idol winner of all time. His failed rocker vibe and music did not captivate or grab anyone’s attention. His album flocked American idol continue to go.

Season 14, we got the winner of NickFradiani personally he is one of my favorite winners, because his music is incredible and underrated. But to the general public, he didn’t sell as bad as the other two but he’s definitely in the bottom five. He did continue to go on to perform in local venues and push forward the best he could. But now it was a stain on the American idol winners, and I believe it stems from that toxic judges panel.

We moved onto season 15, the end of American idol. They brought back the winners and some fan favorites, had a huge celebration for all the years the show was on there. The judges all came back and everybody celebrated. As the winner, Trent Harmon took on the final title of American idol. And even though, it is the end, it did not give him the push. He thought he was going to get. And he once again with the American idol winners became a failed champion.

American idol stayed gone for over a year, and the general public did miss the show, so Walt Disney purchases the show and brings it back with a more positive and energetic flare. They brought it back with the worst voting system, date. The judges had more power than America, so they got to choose majority of who they’re putting in, when America is the one that should be choosing because we are the ones that buy the albums. I said since day one, this was going to be a failure, if they do not change it back to single elimination instead of group elimination. But American idol decided it was going to do its own thing and push on.

Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan became the new judges of American Idol season 16 through 22

I’m gonna combine the seasons together for the most part, but I’m going to still give them their due and their credibility. Season 16 we saw the winner of Maddie Poppee who also was the wrong winner, because Gabby Barrett who worked third place in the show went on to be a country superstar and was the front runner the entire time. We finally got some thing from one of those shows, but it wasn’t the winner. Unfortunately, the winner went on to be a failed winner again.

Season 17 we saw Laine Hardy someone from previous season come back and capture the title. The Elvis look-alike young country megastar was going to be born, but American idol sat on his album debut, and sat on his music. To the point lane, then became a failed winner and gotten legal trouble, he’s making a return today as we speak. But it may be too late for the young country artist. 

Season 18 the pandemic season, the season that took place with everybody filming from their living room or their bedrooms. We watched as American idol still tried to keep this show relevant with everybody submitting their videos, the judges were on zoom, the contestants were on zoom and we continued to watch this show as just Sam, a young woman with financial issues captured the title. She had a beautiful voice and an incredible presence for someone who was never on the stage. Yet, American Idol dropped the ball with her completely, and she became the worst winner of all time. 
 
We moved onto season 19 when Chayce Beckham, captured the title, he went on to also be a failed winner and not successful in the world of music. He did have one song that slowly climb the charts, but never quite got anywhere. He was brought back many times on the show, but that was the only time you seen or heard of him. Yet, just Sam was still left off the show. And never took the stage.

Season 20 we got the winner of Noah Thompson, the wrong winner of American idol hands-down no questions asked. He captured the title of the show because he was extremely attractive. There was no way that America actually voted him in as the best singer, except they chose him based on his looks. And where did it get us another failed winner American idol is tarnished, I don’t see the show producing a mega star ever again. We have went through so much and yet we’ve gotten nowhere. 
 
But American idol continue to push forward with season 21, that’s when America finally saw firsthand. We claimed wrong winners in the past, but this was hands-down the wrong winner. Iam Tongi American idol’s first Hawaiian winner, went on to accomplish nothing. No music, no album and definitely no concerts. He was awarded the win on this show simply because of the passing of his parent, there is no way that this man beat half of the people that he was going up against. Unfortunately, the winners are final and they claim America’s vote. But this is the first time I questioned 100% whether or not, the show was rigged. They think they were going to get success from this person, no, they are not thinking, marketing wise, American idol went for a sympathetic run instead.

Season 22 another controversy strikes American Idol as Katy Perry the judge is called out for bullying a woman for having a baby and sex under age. Even though that is not what happened, we’re in a world of cancel culture. We’re in a world where people blow up social media and change things. So this will be the last season for Katie Perry as a judge. we went on to Crown the winner of Abi Carter, American idol, normally by this time has pushed their artist to be close to having an album, to get music out there and to captivate the world. But we have yet to see anything or hear anything from this young lady and it just looks like we’re gonna follow the same train of another failed winner.

Season 23 Carrie Underwood American idol. All they need is one mega star to come forward to reconnect the crowd and the audience and build up the history of these legendary winners from the past. Because we have not seen a single successful winner since season 10 and before season six. American Idol has more failed winners than they do champions.","Ryan Seacrest, Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, Bobby Bones","american idol , season series juggernaut , one incredible unique

2255,Jeong Do Jeon,Drama,5.1,"I found the earlier parts to be quite good with a reasonable pace. However, 25 episodes later things started to change in a weird direction and the initial spark faded away. Yet, the reality was a letdown. Jeong Do Jeon, the pivotal figure, felt like a distant acquaintance rather than someone I could understand. His struggles and triumphs failed to resonate the longer the drama kept going, leaving me disconnected from the heart of the story by the end of the drama. The ending was very typical with these kind of shows, everyone lose their marbles abruptly so they can jump to the historical ending, if there's any. Jo Jae Hyun and Yoo Dong Geun did a great job as leads, they simply carried the drama with their performance. Even their character was methodical and well written. One thing I wanted to see is having Do Jun's wife playing a bigger role in supporting her husband. I really appreciate their casting choices. Going for a mature looking cast was the correct choice. New to semi-new generation cast with soft looks in their mid 30s would have been disastrous.","Cho Jae-hyun, Yoo Dong-geun, Park Young-kyu, Im Ho, Ahn Jae-mo","find earlier part quite good reasonable pace . however , 25 episodes later things start change weird direction initial spark fade away . yet , reality letdown . jeong jeon , pivotal figure , felt like distant acquaintance rather someone could understand . struggle triumph fail resonate longer drama keep go , leave disconnect heart story end drama . end typical kind show , everyone lose marble abruptly jump historical end , 's . jo jae hyun yoo dong geun great job lead , simply carry drama performance . even character methodical well write . one thing want see jun 's wife play bigger role support husband . really appreciate cast choices . go mature look cast correct choice . new semi-new generation cast soft look mid 30s would disastrous .",1,1

I found much of the humour was based on exposition. In spite of assumptions to the contrary I personally feel its quite hard to make the mechanics of that kind of humour work.  Mr Bean worked but then the humour was well scripted and the laughs well timed. 

For me Ghosts is not a bad watch as such I simply find it more interesting than humourous.

Some patients' stories didn't blend well with what was going on and it passed off as an interruption. It shares a lot of similarities with Jewel in the Palace (2003) but with a less attractive cast. Not only that but it also shares the same problems Jewel in the Palace (2003) had had. You may refer to my comment there. The drama is a remake of the original back in 1999. There was no specific fundamental issues with the base story to prompt a remake. There were too many identical copy-pasted scenes and jokes, they don't take any creative freedom with the core story/scenes to make the remake worthwhile. Although the remake is longer but this came at the expense of its pace since the extended content was poorly utilized and made it a worse experience overall. A lot of over exaggeration/dramatization and a lot less human. I hoped the remake would have a better written ending but no, it was identical frame by frame to the original.

*Black Sails* is a breathtaking journey into the Golden Age of Piracy, where legends come to life, and the thrills never cease. The creators have done a remarkable job weaving together the stories of various legendary pirates, creating a complex and authentic world filled with tension, betrayal, and intrigue. The show's unique atmosphere, excellent character development, and complex social-political layers make *Black Sails* one of the pinnacles of the genre.

**Story and Atmosphere:**

The story of *Black Sails* is set in the early 18th century in the Caribbean, where infamous pirates struggle for survival and riches. The series masterfully combines real historical figures with literary fiction, creating a unique and exciting narrative. The writers have done a brilliant job interlacing the different pirate legends, crafting a narrative that honors these tales while adding new and unexpected twists.

**Intrigue and Power Struggles:**

*Black Sails* excels at portraying the intrigue surrounding the pursuit of power and wealth. The characters will do anything to stay afloat, gain power, or maintain their positions. The series vividly demonstrates how different social classes view and handle political, commercial, and military situations. The show accurately depicts how knowledge, education, and experience could elevate a person during that time, especially if they were sharp-witted and observant—qualities embodied by characters like Captain Flint and Eleanor Guthrie.

**Characters and Development:**

One of the show's greatest strengths is its well-developed characters. Although most of the actors were relatively unknown, they excelled in their roles, and their character development is clearly visible as the story progresses.

**Captain James Flint (Toby Stephens):** Captain Flint is the central figure of the series, a complex and deeply layered character. Initially presented as a cold and calculating leader, Flint reveals more about his past traumas and motivations as the story unfolds. Toby Stephens' brilliant performance makes Flint a character both to admire and fear.

**John Silver (Luke Arnold):** John Silver is one of the show's biggest surprises. Initially appearing as a mere opportunist, he undergoes significant changes through his alliance with Flint and his own ambitions. Luke Arnold does an excellent job portraying Silver's evolution as he navigates the pirate world and gains increasing influence.

**Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New):** Eleanor, the leader of the trading operation on New Providence Island, is an incredibly intelligent and ambitious woman. Hannah New portrays Eleanor's tough and determined character, who can think strategically while ruthlessly managing her dealings with the pirates. Eleanor's character demonstrates how someone can be a successful leader even in the midst of chaos.

**Charles Vane (Zach McGowan):** Charles Vane is one of the most feared pirates in the series, rising to prominence through his raw strength and ruthless nature. Zach McGowan convincingly portrays this brutal yet dedicated leader with his own unique moral code.

**Jack Rackham (Toby Schmitz) and Anne Bonny (Clara Paget):** Jack and Anne are one of the most intriguing pairs in the series. Jack, the cunning and ambitious pirate always looking for the next big score, and Anne, his fierce and loyal partner, are both highly entertaining and deeply complex characters. Their relationship deepens as the series progresses, and they face the challenges of the pirate world together as true partners.

**Max (Jessica Parker Kennedy):** Max is one of the series' most resilient characters, who rises from working in a brothel to becoming one of the most influential women on the island. Her story excellently illustrates the sacrifices needed for survival and how to find the path to power.

**Social Strata and Political Intrigue:**

*Black Sails* masterfully depicts the contrasts between different social classes and their impact on political and commercial relations. The series shows how knowledge and education played crucial roles at the time and how these traits could quickly elevate someone in the social hierarchy. Those who played the game smartly and shrewdly—like Flint or Eleanor—often succeeded, while others fell victim to their own thirst for power.

**Conclusion:**

*Black Sails* is an exceptional series that brilliantly interweaves pirate legends into a complex and thrilling story. With its outstanding characters, masterful storytelling, and depiction of social and political intrigue, this show is a true gem. *Black Sails* is not just for fans of pirate tales but for anyone looking for a deep, thought-provoking, and exciting drama that excels in every aspect.","Toby Stephens, Luke Arnold, Hannah New, Jessica Parker Kennedy, Toby Schmitz","* * black sail : masterpiece pirate lore intrigue * * * * rat : 10/10 * * * black sail * breathtaking journey golden age piracy , legends come life , thrill never cease . creators do remarkable job weave together stories various legendary pirate , create complex authentic world fill tension , betrayal , intrigue . show 's unique atmosphere , excellent character development , complex social-political layer make * black sail * one pinnacle genre . * * story atmosphere : * * story * black sail * set early 18th century caribbean , infamous pirate struggle survival riches . series masterfully combine real historical figure literary fiction , create unique excite narrative . writers do brilliant job interlace different pirate legends , craft narrative honor tales add new unexpected twist . * * intrigue power struggle : * * * black sail * excel portray intrigue surround pursuit power wealth . character anything stay afloat , gain power , maintain position . series vividly demonstrate different social class view handle political , commercial , military situations . show accurately depict knowledge , education , experience could elevate person time , especially sharp-witted observant—qualities embody character like captain flint eleanor guthrie . * * character development : * * one show 's greatest strengths well-developed character . although actors relatively unknown , excel roles , character development clearly visible story progress . * * captain jam flint ( toby stephens ) : * * captain flint central figure series , complex deeply layer character . initially present cold calculate leader , flint reveal past traumas motivations story unfold . toby stephens ' brilliant performance make flint character admire fear . * * john silver ( luke arnold ) : * * john silver one show 's biggest surprise . initially appear mere opportunist , undergo significant change alliance flint ambition . luke arnold excellent job portray silver 's evolution navigate pirate world gain increase influence . * * eleanor guthrie ( hannah new ) : * * eleanor , leader trade operation new providence island , incredibly intelligent ambitious woman . hannah new portray eleanor 's tough determine character , think strategically ruthlessly manage dealings pirate . eleanor 's character demonstrate someone successful leader even midst chaos . * * charles vane ( zach mcgowan ) : * * charles vane one fear pirate series , rise prominence raw strength ruthless nature . zach mcgowan convincingly portray brutal yet dedicate leader unique moral code . * * jack rackham ( toby schmitz ) anne bonny ( clara paget ) : * * jack anne one intrigue pair series . jack , cunning ambitious pirate always look next big score , anne , fierce loyal partner , highly entertain deeply complex character . relationship deepen series progress , face challenge pirate world together true partner . * * max ( jessica parker kennedy ) : * * max one series ' resilient character , rise work brothel become one influential women island . story excellently illustrate sacrifice need survival find path power . * * social strata political intrigue : * * * black sail * masterfully depict contrast different social class impact political commercial relations . series show knowledge education play crucial roles time traits could quickly elevate someone social hierarchy . play game smartly shrewdly—like flint eleanor—often succeed , others fell victim thirst power . * * conclusion : * * * black sail * exceptional series brilliantly interweave pirate legends complex thrill story . outstanding character , masterful storytelling , depiction social political intrigue , show true gem . * black sail * fan pirate tales anyone look deep , thought-provoking , excite drama excel every aspect .",1,1

While I do have a few questions about the series, I won't delve into them here.

I understand the importance of natural movement and that they shouldn't appear robotic while saving the city, which is okay, but it could be toned down. I also understand that young viewers may not notice this as much. But I won't deduct any stars for this aspect, as the TV series is designed for children who likely won't even notice it.

2309,The Mandalorian,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Action & Adventure, Drama",8.4,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com

Star Wars is a very special franchise to millions of people around the world, myself included. I remember when The Force Awakens was announced, and everyone got excited and pumped to experience this beautiful universe once again. However, with social media having a massive impact, the huge fanbase transformed into something so disrespectful and hateful that I find no longer fun discussing the saga with other aficionados... except for The Mandalorian.

If I had to bet that Jon Favreau was going to create such an astonishing Star Wars series that the whole fanbase would unanimously love, I would have lost so much money because I would have bet against this. There's no denying that the newest cinematic trilogy is one of the most divisive in the history of cinema. But there's also no denying that The Mandalorian belongs to the saga's universally beloved pieces of cinema/television.

This show is a near-perfect depiction of what the universe looks like post-Empire. Some are looking for scraps of the war to make themselves some money, others are trying to hunt criminals to collect bounties, like The Mandalorian or Mando for short (I will use the latter to refer to the character). Following Pedro Pascal's lead character, one that has no name or face throughout the season can be a challenging task in the sense that it's hard to emotionally connect with someone who we wouldn't recognize in the streets. Except we do.

Pascal's facial performance might be impossible to evaluate, but his body movements and attitude are so unique that Mando can be easily distinguished from the remaining members of his Guild. Obviously, his costume also helps to tell him apart from other Mandalorians. However, it's the rich, intelligent writing that surprises me. After a few episodes, I feel like I know Mando, even if he doesn't say much. I understand his life principles, who he trusts, who he doesn't... Yes, there are a bunch of secret past adventures that molded him into being what he is (I'll get there). Still, a simple action like not selling something, not killing someone, or simply a helmet turn a bit faster/slower goes a long way to show the audience who's the character we are supposed to support.

Every single episode is packed with entertainment. There's always some action, and it always brings something new. It can be an innovative trick, a different location, or new characters like Baby Yoda, who undoubtedly becomes the star of the show, and I'll leave it at that. I won't develop or spoil what everyone is or does, but I do have to mention Gina Carano (Cara) and Carl Weathers (Greef Karga). Both are important to the storyline, and both actors deliver great performances. If Gina gives her all during the action sequences, Carl uses his eloquent speech to provide the necessary exposition.

If there was a slight doubt regarding Disney's commitment to this show, the mind-blowing production level shuts down any question about that subject. This series doesn't merely resemble Star Wars, it *feels* like Star Wars. The whole season looks absolutely stunning! Gorgeous cinematography, fantastic set designs, and even the costumes of each species look amazing. Technically, it's one of the best TV shows of the decade, and every director does a tremendous job.

One other aspect I love is how each episode feels different. Each director brings his/her personal filmmaking flair, making every chapter feel new every time. Dave Filoni, who fans will know from the animated Star Wars series, does a good job with the pilot. Deborah Chow, who's the sole director of the Obi-Wan series, delivers brilliant action and a fast pace. Rick Famuyiwa puts a horror vibe into his sequences. And Taika Waititi (who also performs the voice of a droid named IG-11) ends the season with a thunderous finale. However, it's due to Jon Favreau's screenplay that everything works together so seamlessly. Impeccable writing, especially concerning the protagonist.

I have just one issue with the debut season, which is the overall plot. For a long time, it doesn't feel like it has one. It feels like entertainment for the sake of entertainment, just with compelling characters. Following Mando from planet to planet, from mission to mission, can be tons of fun, but if that's all the season has to give, then that fun can quickly turn into monotony (chapter five is definitely the favorite for the worst episode of the season). A lot of questions concerning Mando's past keep coming up, and while I understand that the series needs to have something for a second season, I also feel that a few answers here and there could have helped the story.

If there's one thing that The Mandalorian proves is that Disney has more than enough capabilities to produce a great Star Wars piece... as long as it has someone supervising it with a clear plan and structure, which didn't happen with the sequel trilogy. It isn't a coincidence that the two episodes with no involvement of Favreau on the writing are the season's worst. The apparent lack of a central plot can be damaging, but not enough to steal the ""best Star Wars TV series"" crown.

With an outstanding cast and talented directors, Jon Favreau offers the world the opportunity to live in the Star Wars universe, following Pedro Pascal's character in some of the most entertaining adventures the saga has ever witnessed. Technically superb, with stunning cinematography, excellent editing, an addictive score (it can feel weird in the beginning, but it grew on me), and amazing directing from everyone involved. Nevertheless, it's Favreau's writing and well-planned season's structure that make this debut a gigantic success. Undoubtedly, one of the best shows of the year.

Chaske Spencer - who I recognised from a bit-part in Banshee is the pinnacle of charisma here.  It just feels like Peacock's a step-up from Hallmark, where aging actors go to die...  which is a more interesting concept than Teacup the series.
It's Science Fiction that's aware of the word ""science"" but not really sure what it means.
The script and dialogue are terrible, particularly bad when coming out of Speedman or Strahovski.  The teen daughter's alright, I just want the young boy to die - bloodily and grandma is on screen and that's as remarkable as it gets.
The episodes are about half an hour long and feel a lot longer in a bad way, there's tedium surrounding whoever Speedman plays having an affair with non-descript character and that feels included because producers/director are aware of how little there is to work with in the script/from the book?

2341,My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu,"Animation, Comedy, Drama",8.3,"Now, I'll admit that the first time I saw the synopsis for this anime, I thought Oregairu would be a stereotypical romcom anime. Just think about it. There are two female main characters and a male character. The male character is an outcast. One of the female characters is the school's most beautiful girl. How original. But when I finished the first episode of this anime. I knew that this was something different. Something that manages to stray from the norm and becomes something extraordinary.

**Story:** Now, the story revolves around Hikigaya Hachiman. He is a high school student, an outcast of the entire school. Fortunately, this suits him just fine, as he has always wanted to be a loner and not make friends with anyone. It falls apart quickly, though: his teacher forces him to join a club that is supposed to help people with their problems. Even worse, the club also has the bright and beautiful 'ice-cold Beauty,' Yukino Yukinoshita (nicknamed that for her cold personality). Hilarity ensues. Now, the story revolves around the club helping out with people's requests and problems. Although the problems are simple, the way the main characters solve the problem isn't. The comedy usually revolves around Hachiman and Yukino's witty dialogue and sarcasm (which is funny, btw).

**Art:** The art was good most of the time. Backgrounds were filled with radiant colors and were nicely drawn. Character designs were also done well and fit well with the characters' personalities.  It went a little low for some episodes, one or two, but all in all, it's pretty good.

**Sound:** The sound was quite impressive. The soundtrack fits well with the anime. The opening 'Yukitoki' is catchy, as I find myself humming to it in the shower days after I first heard it. The ending, I'm afraid, is good enough for an end.

**Character:** Now, this is where Oregairu excels the most. Let's start with Hikigaya Hachiman. Hachiman's crooked view of life and society is indeed one of the most exciting views of life that I've ever come across. His views of life affected my way of viewing life. Also, his monologues are exciting and show a bit more of his character. Yuki Yukinoshita is very opposite from Hachiman. She's intelligent, beautiful, and rich. But the exciting thing is she doesn't have friends either. Unlike Hachiman, her reason for not having friends is her icy demeanor and being too perfect. She, unlike Hachiman, believes that change is a good thing. Her sharp tongue is humorous, and her fights with Hachiman are hilarious. All in all, she is also a likable character. Yui Yuigahama, at first sight, would appear to be an stereotypical character. I couldn't say that I loved her as much as I loved the other two main characters, yet I would have to admit that without her, this anime wouldn't be as good. She's the one who pretty much holds the whole club together. Her character does end up developing into something independent and helpful, however.

In the end, Oregairu did turn out to be a good series. What I thought would be some stereotypical rom-com anime was something more than that. I would recommend it to anybody who watches anime.","Takuya Eguchi, Saori Hayami, Nao Toyama, Ayane Sakura, Aoi Yuki",", 'll admit first time saw synopsis anime , think oregairu would stereotypical romcom anime . think . two female main character male character . male character outcast . one female character school 's beautiful girl . original . finish first episode anime . know something different . something manage stray norm become something extraordinary . * * story : * * , story revolve around hikigaya hachiman . high school student , outcast entire school . fortunately , suit fine , always want loner make friends anyone . fall apart quickly , though : teacher force join club suppose help people problems . even worse , club also bright beautiful 'ice-cold beauty , ' yukino yukinoshita ( nickname cold personality ) . hilarity ensue . , story revolve around club help people 's request problems . although problems simple , way main character solve problem n't . comedy usually revolve around hachiman yukino 's witty dialogue sarcasm ( funny , btw ) . * * art : * * art good time . background fill radiant color nicely draw . character design also do well fit well character ' personalities . go little low episodes , one two , , 's pretty good . * * sound : * * sound quite impressive . soundtrack fit well anime . open 'yukitoki ' catchy , find hum shower days first hear . end , 'm afraid , good enough end . * * character : * * , oregairu excel . let 's start hikigaya hachiman . hachiman 's crook view life society indeed one excite view life 've ever come across . view life affect way view life . also , monologues excite show bite character . yuki yukinoshita opposite hachiman .

I can only talk for myself of course, but I thoroughly enjoyed this Dexter revival/miniseries. It's nothing as good as the phenomenal season four and probably is a tad short when compared to the seasons that precede the aforementioned, but it's without doubt much better than anything that followed The Trinity Killer.

It's an absolute joy to see Michael C. Hall back as Dexter, it's testament to his acting and the character that you genuinely love to watch him. Jennifer Carpenter's return as Debra is also terrific, as is the late reappearance of the awesome Batista (David Zayas) but also the newcomers to the series are enjoyable too. I got attached to the community of characters pretty much instantly, with the standouts being Jack Alcott, Julia Jones and Clancy Brown. I'd be up for seeing more, honestly.

I found the story to be rather engrossing, it got me tense and uncomfortable a fair few times. I see some say it's rushed, I won't quite say that but the last few episodes do feel a bit sped up - but I gained much entertainment from it and feel happy about the ending, which is much more satisfying than the original conclusion that we got. I see IMDb reviewers have the final episode as the serie's lowest ever, which is absolute rubbish in my opinion - borderline insulting, in fact.

I read there are rumours of a continuation of some sort. I'd be up for one no doubt, but I'd be pleased if it ended here too.","Michael C.

Dickinson is such a well-written show. The way Alena Smith took the story of a young poet (Emily Dickinson) more than 150 years ago and turned it into something so relatable to the current generation was just amazing. 



It’s interesting how the entire story was set at a horrible time in history where the fight for women’s rights was still a blur and then the civil war was brewing and yet, the story was structured to make us smile and laugh. It was made such that all the passion of Emily Dickinson could be felt.



The way her poems were related to the instances of each episode allowed you to almost have a glimpse into the mind of the great poet that is Emily Dickinson which was in some ways sad because she didn’t live a particularly fun life (as she spent most of it in her room), but also very filled with love, happiness, and passion. 





The show was simply amazing and should be treated with a lot of respect for the writer, directors, cast and everyone who helped put it together. If not for the story itself, then at least for making people laugh in the face of such unsettling situations. This is very good one, a gem.","Hailee Steinfeld, Toby Huss, Adrian Enscoe, Anna Baryshnikov, Ella Hunt","thoughts dickinson dickinson well-written show . way alena smith take story young poet ( emily dickinson ) 150 years ago turn something relatable current generation amaze . ’ interest entire story set horrible time history fight women ’ right still blur civil war brew yet , story structure make us smile laugh . make passion emily dickinson could felt . way poems relate instance episode allow almost glimpse mind great poet emily dickinson ways sad ’ live particularly fun life ( spend room ) , also fill love , happiness , passion . show simply amaze treat lot respect writer , directors , cast everyone help put together . story , least make people laugh face unsettle situations . good one , gem .",1,1

This K-Drama contains episodes which usually last as long as an Indie movie, and I suppose that is the case with most of the K-Dramas that come out. But Vincenzo knows how to utilize the entirety of its long runtime for its advantage. Even when it lowers its pace, it compensates for it with its breathtaking cinematography and character moments which are worthy of the attention that is being given to them. It has a fantastic score and soundtrack which it doesn’t shy away from using. And while repeated usage of the same score tends to become a bit monotonous, it hardly takes away from the epic twist or reveal of the sequence. The characters and their performances bring together a cohesive amalgam of heartwarming and humorous scenes.
The members of the Geumga Plaza are each different in their own funny little ways and as we go on, we learn more about their hidden talents and their quirks keep enhancing. The chemistry between Vincenzo and Hong Cha-Young, which transcends from being partners to being each other’s love interests, is extremely cheesy at times and definitely what the show is trying to go for. It yearns for those awe-inspiring moments, but the action, thrill and violence of the show elevate the mature themes up a notch. When we see Vincenzo, he is not a protagonist. He is a feared Mafia outlaw who has killed his share of men, so that makes him an Anti-Hero. But his moral code is specific and he only punishes those who have done wrong to him or to others.

Imagine all of the school related tired tropes and cliches amplified by cringe to create the cheesiest abomination. Jason as a character, actor, story and writing was easily the worst aspect of this drama. Which created one of the worst memorable dynamics with his love interest. From the outset, the plot followed a predictable trajectory but things got a lot worse around the last 1/3 of its run. During which the story became static, the characters fell apart and the drama started to shove empty scenes of side characters. They reduced Sam Dong screen time significantly as well. They also isolated Pil Sook and Jason despite being main characters and had little to no interactions with others later on. All of this led to a below average last episode and a lukewarm ending. Despite its flaws and problems, somehow it worked, to a certain degree.

In comparison, season 2 was an obvious downgrade in all regards, it's just plain worse. The empty scenes I mentioned earlier turned into amateurish random musical performances here. I noticed they were mostly using Korean songs in this season, compared to season 1 which had more western/global songs.

It was humorous, informative and the donations they collected went to a charity, not to buy a jet for an evangelist.

2656,Pure In Heart,Drama,5.0,"This was a meaty 167 episodes daily drama that left me with conflicting feelings. To get some positives out of the way, I much appreciate the roughness and scuffiness of older dailies over the jaded cleanliness and overly-sanitized modern dailies. It's a good thing that conflicts don't last a long time in this lengthy drama, but this also created a problem I'll talk about later. The drama took advantage of its length in regards to the main point of tension with the objecting parents of the ML, simply, let the girl hang around long enough until they get used to her. Now, let's get into the underlying problems. There was a love triangle involving the 70ish elderly father, his 50ish son, and the restaurant lady, I've never seen such an absurd, trashy and distasteful love triangle like this one before. It's shocking how much screen time they dedicated to that which was for almost the entire runtime. Due to its length, the drama was somewhat divided into 2 halves that were different enough to consider one a downgrade over the other. The exact point that split it into 2 halves was when the pseudo love triangle/square over the FL was resolved. In comparison, the most glaring difference was with the characters' writing of the duo Uk Yeong & Yun Jeong, they made them dumb, quirky, and borderline retarded, just because they were out of the circling conflicts from the first half and had no other roles to justify their existence  in the drama. It's clear that its length was problematic. There was a shocking lack of material to fill the runtime. Initially, it had many small side plots that seemed promising but were completely dropped off after a handful of episodes, for example, the rouge sister Yun Ji and her ostracized family. There was only 2 main plotlines running in parallel, whatever was the FL involved in and the repulsive elderly love triangle. This could've been easily fixed since they already had enough pieces laid out. For example, give Shin Hyeong a full family background dynamic to interact with everyone rather than being a random employee with no attachments to anything, replace the elderly love triangle with another involving Wu Suk and other characters, despite the established premise but giving the female lead some familial connections would strengthen her character's existence, and lastly give the lead couples more problems to overcome rather than a couple of elongated ones. Finally, there was a huge lack of affection from the female lead while the male lead was always loud, clear and persistent about his love, she couldn't reciprocate his feeling with the same level if any at all, leaving a constant weird imbalance in their relationship. As if she was pressured to accept his love and run with it, nonetheless, this was less of a problem later on. At the end of the day and despite everything, this was just an okay vanilla daily drama.","Koo Hye-sun, Seo Ji-seok, Lee Min-woo, Han Jin-hee, Jo Mi-ryung","meaty 167 episodes daily drama leave conflict feelings . get positives way , much appreciate roughness scuffiness older dailies jade cleanliness overly-sanitized modern dailies .

I managed most of the first tedious episode, before calling it a day. Lets start with the poor story. A story that makes Rick Grimes character look fragile, impulsive, whilst at the same time, indecisive and incoherent. The opening scene see's Rick cut off his own hand to escape from his captors, only to fall semi-conscious minutes later. Its a poorly thought through plan to say the least, that does not reflect the clever, strategic leader, established so convincingly, in the main series.

Given how ""revisionist"" Rick is being portrayed, I have an instinctive feeling, the show wont centre around this iconic character. No strong male leads, right? I was not surprised in the slightest either, by yet more dreary, woke nonsense. 

The very limited upside includes quality acting, its a strong cast. Sets and CGI are above average. That said, the pluses can't make up for the noticeable deficits.

2723,Marvel'S Jessica Jones,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.5,"3/3.5 stars

Recently started watching this show and for the first several episodes I was very intrigued. Kilgrave the super-villain (acted insanely well by Tennant), is compelling, and Jones at first is sympathetic, interesting, and supporting characters have promise.

Unfortunately by Episode 7 I had lost quite a bit of interest. After a while Jones - perpetually drunk, unwashed, sullen and angry - grates; she is very one-dimensional. Although what happened to her was terrible, other people have suffered at Kilgrave's hands, but no one takes it to the persistent pity-party levels Jones does, or does as good a job at alienating people. She's not coping, and snarls at anyone who tries to help her. She doesn't want people to get hurt because of her, but she is so emotionally crippled and wound so tightly by what happened it is difficult to trust her judgment and perspective, or sometimes even if she is sane. She can't see that every moment she lives her life in a broken way is a victory for Kilgrave. 

Episode 7 is a good example. After Kilgrave leaves her a terrible 'present', she hatches a wacky, unbelievable plot that she eventually convinces her friends to sort of go along with, against their better judgment. (Just the idea that a 'detective' would THINK you could get locked up immediately in SuperMax is absurd.) It's not even clear that she has really thought this through but her wild ranting and demand that everyone listen to her finally 'wins' people over. You get the feeling after a while any price is okay as long as she beats Kilgrave. Kilgrave is a bloody monster, but I'm not certain Jones wouldn't be okay with the entire world going to Hell if she could finally catch him. 

She's just too one dimensional. Her potential thoughtfulness and complexity is lost in a haze of booze, self-recrimination and self-pity. After a while she doesn't really engender sympathy but encourages eye rolls. 

I also haven't felt the connexion with Luke. Carnally maybe, but there is nothing that gives you a feel for them together, except for one scene at a food truck and protracted interactions in the bedroom. 

Ruben is a wasted character; I thought there would be more to him and his infatuation, but no. Malcolm and Simpson clearly have parts to play and I am still a bit curious what will happen but that is now really tempered. I was excited to see the next episode but I need time to recover after the mess that was 7.

The ongoing Kdrama series— Alchemy of Souls do not render less, so far, it puts CGI to good use to create a unique and mesmerising experience for the viewers.

According to www.naijabanquet.com, First, Daeho, the surreal setting of Alchemy of Souls piques our curiosity from the beginning of the series. Much more so, the impressive fight by the frozen lake plunges us directly into the midst of things. Here, many mages have mastered the craft of the alchemy of souls— a kind of magic/spell casting that involves soul-shifting. Naturally, this process goes against the law of natural existence. However, by their power, they (the mages) could colonize innocent bodies.

Two of these occasions results in the existence of the main leads: Jang Uk and Mu Deok Yi. While Jang Uk is a product of soul shifting by royal command, Naksu now Mu Deok, casts her last spell to save her soul. In most cases, however, the result seems disappointing. Naksu, the daredevil assassin who has mastered all the four creeds of soul shifting fails to land her soul in a physically fit body but rather in the frail body of Mu Deok.

Sometimes too, the notion, “power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely” comes to play as some soul shifters grow wild and corrupt, feeding on souls and turning men into rocks.

But what strikes us more is the hypnotizing scenery that comes with the process, though terrifying. For instance, when Jang Gang casts his spell to shifts the soul of the King, we are teleported to an entirely new world of fantasy of water, fire and brimstone.

2788,Marvel'S The Punisher,"Action & Adventure, Crime, Drama",8.111,"SEASON ONE: 10 Stars

It's not Jessica Jones, but it's also the BEST cinematic version of the Punisher to date, including the 1989 Dolph Lundgren version which is arguably the best movie version to date.

Now, I've seen people on IMDb complain about the lack of super powers and the violence involved in the series and, well, clearly they aren't really familiar with the source material.

Especially since The Punisher is essentially Dexter. That is he's a serial killer tolerated only because he kills the bad guys. But still...serial killer.

And with that in mind, you have a series about a killer that kills a lot of killers worse than he is. Only unlike Dexter, he's killing them with guns and not really concerned about getting caught or the evidence he leaves behind.

He's just a killer. And, well, it works. It's done right. And the characters are perfect.

SEASON TWO:

Season 1 I gave 10 stars. Season 2 did something so anti-Punisher that I had to bring it down to 1.

It did the Jessica Jones thing. The first season was amazing, not Season 1 of Jessica Jones good, but it nailed The Punisher better than even some of the writers in the comics could ever dream of (MAX clearly excluded).

And then it does the political thing and unfortunately the politics were ""Woke.""

Now with Jessica Jones the kind of politics weren't that important...they still killed the show...but at least the politics fit the character.

Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Luke Cage (to an extent) you can introduce far left politics and it would fit their character. Daredevil is defined more by being a Catholic...but even then you can take the character to the left and it would fit (just not as far). They are all essentially liberal characters....but the Punisher is not a liberal character.

The Punisher can't go woke, Jessica can, but The Punisher is essentially a serial killing super conservative authoritarian. He's not a nice person.

The Punisher is slightly right of Atilla the Hun. He makes Trump look like a liberal. That is the essence of his character. He's an authoritarian.

He's a conservative character, that is his personality. He's more of a Neo-Con than Iron Man, he's more conservative than Mr. Fantastic..and Netflix made him woke.

It is a personality trait that brings him into conflict with so many other Marvel characters, especially very liberal characters like Captain America.

And I realize that woke people are also authoritarian...but it's an authoritarianism that is the direct opposite of The Punisher.

So, not only did they inject politics into my escapism again (which I hate) but this time the politics where in direct contrast to the character's personality.

So congratulations Netflix, you messed up a really good show on two levels.

Injecting politics into a show is irritating when you are watching it to escape the bleak reality on the news...but when the politics contrast the essence of the character it's a tragedy.","Jon Bernthal, Ben Barnes, Amber Rose Revah, Josh Stewart, Jason R.

It tough to rate an anthology, but most of these stories were very good. His best ones were with characters you didn't really relate with, but still felt something for.

Then there were some comedies. One in which he purposely made it predictable that a ""dining club"" was eating its members when they got fat enough. The dark comedy was funny because of how oblivious the member was for being the next meal, even though everything pointed to it.

2802,The Tudors,"Drama, Desconocido",7.8,"When you consider the richness of the dramatic storylines provided by the Medici and the Borgia - everything from megalomania, incest, war, debauchery, torture - even the odd, honest loving relationship - then the Tudors, a family of upstart Welsh ""pantrymen"" (as Errol Flynn referred to them in ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939)), ought to be up there. Well, sadly, this doesn't really deliver at all. Henry VII - the first Tudor king of England - who reigned for almost a quarter of a century doesn't feature at all; therefore we are deprived of any backstory to the real focus character of these 38 episodes. Henry VIII had a reputation as a brute, a violent headstrong man with a penchant for women, power and coupled with his arguably even more ambitious Chancellor Wolsey we ought to have had a belter of a drama with just about nothing off limits! Nope, no chance - we have in the two lead characters the Tudor equivalent of ""Peter Pan"" and ""Wendy"". Jonathan Rhys Meyers is dreadful, and Sam Neill has all the menace of a wet sponge as the scheming Cardinal with designs on the Papacy. Regrettably, these lacklustre opening episodes sets the tone for the remainder of this really lacking drama. The storylines give the faintest of nods to this lively period of English history, but even the Anne Boleyn (the frankly awful Natalie Dormer) scenarios - which are the stuff of novels and dissertations the world over become little more than a fancy dress farce. We rarely see anything of substance emerge - the establishment of the Church of Engand is but a scant moment amongst the pantomime this has quickly become. Henry Cavill provides some eye candy as his best mate ""Suffolk""; Kris Holden Reid as the sexually ambitious ""Compton"" (he of the famous Soho London St, presumably?) - hell, even Peter O'Toole gets in on the act picking up Sir John Gielgud's mantle as the go-to actor for the role of a Pope (Paul III). None of the wives, including the aforementioned Dormer, exude anything by way of chemistry or personality, with Joss Stone far too attractive to be the convincing turn off ""Anne of Cleves"" depicted here. To be fair, a great deal of attention has been paid to the look of the series. The costumes are top drawer and the CGI complimentary rather than intrusive. That said, the whole thing is an hugely disappointing exercise in big budget drama with little focus on the quality of the writing. The casting assumes we would rather have pretty things to look at than actors who could immerse us in this exciting and turbulent period of history - and aside from Ray Winstone's terrible effort with the same character (from 2003) this is easily the worst portrayal of Henry VIII I have ever witnessed. Mercifully, the whole thing runs out of steam before the accession of his daughter (another Tudor with an enthusiasm for depriving Queen's of their heads) saving us from being subjected to another 45 years worth of this sappy Showtime saga.","Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Henry Cavill, Sarah Bolger, Max Brown, David O'Hara","consider richness dramatic storylines provide medici borgia - everything megalomania , incest , war , debauchery , torture - even odd , honest love relationship - tudors , family upstart welsh `` pantrymen '' ( errol flynn refer `` private live elizabeth essex '' ( 1939 ) ) , ought . well , sadly , n't really deliver . henry vii - first tudor king england - reign almost quarter century n't feature ; therefore deprive backstory real focus character 38 episodes . henry viii reputation brute , violent headstrong man penchant women , power couple arguably even ambitious chancellor wolsey ought belter drama nothing limit ! nope , chance - two lead character tudor equivalent `` peter pan '' `` wendy '' . jonathan rhys meyers dreadful , sam neill menace wet sponge scheme cardinal design papacy . regrettably , lacklustre open episodes set tone remainder really lack drama . storylines give faintest nod lively period english history , even anne boleyn ( frankly awful natalie dormer ) scenarios - stuff novels dissertations world become little fancy dress farce . rarely see anything substance emerge - establishment church engand scant moment amongst pantomime quickly become . henry cavill provide eye candy best mate `` suffolk '' ; kris holden reid sexually ambitious `` compton '' ( famous soho london st , presumably ? ) - hell , even peter o'toole get act pick sir john gielgud 's mantle go-to actor role pope ( paul iii ) . none wive , include aforementioned dormer , exude anything way chemistry personality , joss stone far attractive convince turn `` anne cleves '' depict . fair , great deal attention pay look series . costume top drawer cgi complimentary rather intrusive . say , whole thing hugely disappoint exercise big budget drama little focus quality write . cast assume would rather pretty things look actors could immerse us excite turbulent period history - aside ray winstone 's terrible effort character ( 2003 ) easily worst portrayal henry viii ever witness . mercifully , whole thing run steam accession daughter ( another tudor enthusiasm deprive queen 's head ) save us subject another 45 years worth sappy showtime saga .",1,1

**_Season 1_**

When I heard the news that M. Night Shyamalan would be producing a horror TV series, I instantly got intrigued. For some reason, probably due to the tremendous amount of movies to watch, I forgot that the show was coming out at the end of November. Since no one seemed to be talking about it, I couldn't remember its existence until this week. I have no idea why people are so quiet. Servant is one of the best (new) TV shows I've seen in the last few years. People are giving all credit to Shyamalan, but I'm not going to make the same mistake.

Tony Basgallop created and wrote the show. There are five other directors besides Shyamalan, who only directs episodes one and nine. I love Shyamalan as much as the next guy, I've always defended him, and his name alone is enough to convince me to watch anything. He's the reason why I got interested in Servant in the first place. However, the mysterious premise was the aspect that truly captivated me. From the pilot until the finale, every single episode is packed with unanswered questions, enigmatic answers, and a whole lot of tension-building.

Besides being extremely well-written, the dialogues are filled with suspense and an incredible amount of tension. Every director does a fantastic job of keeping a creepy atmosphere, using opposite shots like close-ups and wides to create that uneasy environment. Most of the narrative is set inside the Turner's house, offering that claustrophobic vibe I love so much. Being mostly a one-location show, it never deviates the viewer from what's happening, maintaining the focus on each and every member of the family.

I rarely feel the need for binging a whole season. I enjoy waiting a week or so for the next episode. It lets me think about what happened, it creates a space for me to reflect on a certain character's actions or understand why a particular narrative decision didn't quite work for me. I don't agree that someone who binges seven seasons of, for example, Game of Thrones, will have the same emotional attachment to the story and its characters than someone who waited all those years for the final season. It's just a different perspective and experience. Nevertheless, Servant always left me with that feeling of ""I need to watch the next episode immediately"".

Now, I don't think it's a show for everyone, and I know that people don't like it when someone writes this, but I'll explain. Servant isn't an exposition-driven narrative. It doesn't answer any of the questions you have until the very end, and even then, it leaves room for different interpretations of the story. Every episode is very ambiguous and enigmatic, sometimes adding more and more questions than answers or clues. For a lot of people, it's a show that heavily relies on the final episode's revelations to ultimately consider it a success or a disappointment. If you don't enjoy this type of series, then it's probably for the best that you skip it.

However, if this is ""your thing"", sit down and enjoy this amazing show Basgallop created with the help of Shyamalan. Technically, I can't help but praise the cinematography (Mike Gioulakis, who worked with Shyamalan on Glass and Split, and also with Jordan Peele on Us). The elegant long takes are crucial for keeping the viewer's eyes on the characters, and truly listen to what they're saying. With the help of seamless editing (and the unusual short runtime, thirty minutes per episode feels like an odd duration nowadays), almost every episode goes like the wind.

Exquisite control of the pacing makes the show flow impressively well. The set and production design are always important in one-location pieces, and Servant doesn't lack quality in these regards. Subtle but effectively sinister score (Trevor Gureckis). It's the first show I watch from Apple TV+, and I'm thankful that the company gives the opportunity to great filmmakers to prove their worth instead of producing gigantic CGI festivals right off the bat. I left the best for last, and that is the cast. It doesn't matter how good a screenplay is if the actors can't bring it to life properly.

The four main actors are ALL outstanding! Toby Kebbell hasn't done anything in the past that genuinely surprised me, but now he demonstrated how good of an actor he is. He deals with long dialogues effortlessly, and his close-ups are the most captivating of all. Plus, the whole cooking sequences are visually eye-opening (though I advise they might be too much for the more sensible viewers). Lauren Ambrose seemed a bit out of place in the beginning, but once I understood where her character came from, her performance made total sense. Her display in the finale gave me chills.

However, Rupert Grint (Julian Pearce, Dorothy's brother) and Nell Tiger Free are two unbelievably remarkable surprises. The former gets out of that Harry Potter shell and finally shows that he's more than a mere Ron Weasley. Really engaging performance from him. As for Nell (who didn't have time to show what she can do as Myrcella Baratheon, in Game of Thrones), she carries the most essential role of all. She's the ""black sheep"" of the story, the conflict, the strange and out-of-place character. She needed to be absolutely perfect to make the viewer confused about her motivations, and she nailed it. Undoubtedly, she's the biggest revelation of the series.

I don't understand why Servant doesn't have more fans, and I can't cope with the silence of the people who actually watched it. It's a series that deserves a lot more credit. Boasting a phenomenal cast with Rupert Grint and Nell Tiger Free as the biggest surprises, Tony Basgallop created an incredibly intriguing, mysterious, suspenseful, and intense show with the help of the great M. Night Shyamalan. Brilliant, tension-packed, uncut dialogues help generate a creepy, uneasy atmosphere, elevated by some terrific cinematography (Mike Gioulakis). Filmed mostly in one-location, the set and production design highly improve the claustrophobic environment. The narrative is ambiguous throughout, it's not an exposition-driven screenplay. If you don't appreciate this kind of shows that ask more than answer, then it might be better to skip it. But if you love stories that make you think and second-guess everything, Servant is a genius work.

2925,What We Do In The Shadows,"Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.0,"""What We Do In The Shadows"" is a series knock off of the rather eccentric cinematic comedy of the same name from 2014.

This time the series moves from New Zealand to the USA. No doubt looking to tap into the much bigger US audience. That said, its cast is predominantly English and it employs Kiwi talent in the production, from the original film. 

Its not a bad move but just like the original film I'd suggest its humour will either appeal to you or it won't. I like things a little off beat and deadpan but I honestly struggled to find the first two episodes funny. 

For me I'd describe this series as more ""interesting"" than amusing. There are other series in a similar vein, such as ""Being Human"". 

That said this series is different enough to merit attention.Particularly the vampires often absurd lack of self awareness of how much the world has changed around them. Their longevity hasn't made them wiser its simply made them old and anachronistic.

As it stands a decent effort I rate a 6/10.","Kayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, Harvey Guillén, Mark Proksch","`` shadow '' series knock rather eccentric cinematic comedy name 2014. time series move new zealand usa . doubt look tap much bigger us audience . say , cast predominantly english employ kiwi talent production , original film . bad move like original film 'd suggest humour either appeal wo n't . like things little beat deadpan honestly struggle find first two episodes funny .

With the reboot, I feel the target audience has completely shifted towards adults, or to be more precise, towards the people who were kids during the original show.

Children nowadays can still enjoy it, but they will miss out on most of the jokes and even more importantly they will miss out on the (political) satire which the reboot introduces and which wasn't (really) present in the original. Animaniacs always worked on more than one level and always had a deeper narrative than the one on the surface and with 30 years experience they perfected that art to the point that they can safely address any topic, without the children, the censors, the soccer moms or the PC police even noticing. Which allows them to address issues that any other ""children's show"" wouldn't dare touch with a ten foot pole and even sprinkle little tiny truths in there that everyone knows, but in today's climate no one dares to say out loud anymore and watching them do that was the most fun for me - but the whole show is just so much fun and just works on so many levels!","Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnell, Tress MacNeille, Maurice LaMarche","animaniacs always quite deep `` children 's show '' always target towards adults well . reboot , feel target audience completely shift towards adults , precise , towards people kid original show . children nowadays still enjoy , miss joke even importantly miss ( political ) satire reboot introduce n't ( really ) present original . animaniacs always work one level always deeper narrative one surface 30 years experience perfect art point safely address topic , without children , censor , soccer moms pc police even notice . allow address issue `` children 's show '' would n't dare touch ten foot pole even sprinkle little tiny truths everyone know , today 's climate one dare say loud anymore watch fun - whole show much fun work many level !",1,1

The story, the acting, the _chemistry_. Never have I gotten as invested in a k-drama as I did with this one. Byeon Woo Seok and Kim Hye Joon were absolute perfection and a joy to watch together. The story was lighthearted and cute, full of adorable moments and smiles, but when the emotional moments came, they hit hard. I loved every second of it, including all the small side stories of the secondary characters. Every last detail was perfect.

I'd thought Park Gyu Young and Cha Eun Woo were super cute in _A good day to be a dog_, but nah. Same with Jun Ho being the most adorable he-falls-first male lead ever. Or CLOY having a top-tier romance story. This show left them in the dust.

Sonagi was a lovely song and so personal to Seon Jae and poignant to the story, and I love that there were scenes of live-played music. That may seem like an insignificant detail, but it's so unusual in k-dramas (even in the ones with idols playing the leads) and was so wonderfully unexpected and exciting.

2970,1883,"Drama, Western",8.27,"I should start by saying that not having watched any of Yellowstone yet, I entered this series from a strictly neutral position.

This series felt almost like an odd combination of a Greek tragedy and Agatha Christie’s novel Ten Little Indians (aka And Then There were None). I won’t even explain why as I want to steer as clear of spoilers as I can.

As with many cable series before it, in the tradition of Sopranos, Breaking bad and others, this story is dramatic enough to pull you along enthralled even as you may have qualms or doubts about aspects of it. Plus it has Sam Elliot, always worth a look, and great performant by two country singers, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. And let’s not forget the great ensemble cast.

The scenery is awesome, the soundtrack effective and the script is excellent for the most part. I must say I got really tired of the voiceover narration. Partly, I will admit, because I am not a big fan of voiceovers anyway, but also as if felt like teenager Elsa was passing along much more wisdom and historical perspective then someone her age would have access to. I mean, compare the girl’s antics at the beginning to the mini-lectures a few short weeks later.

While Hercules is a straightforward hero who nearly always does the right thing, Xena is a former warlord who longs for redemption but still possesses some of the savage characteristics that caused her to ruin other people's lives.  An unusual choice for the hero of an adventure show; in fact her name is Greek for ""the strange woman"".

The show was bizarre for its sheer lack of consistency.  For example, the afterlife: sometimes it was the Greek Hades, sometimes the Christian Heaven and Hell, sometimes Hindu-style reincarnation, and they were never reconciled.  As another example, the character of Joxer, sometimes a contemptible buffoon, sometimes a sort of Holy Fool whose innocence and devotion impress Xena. Another wierd feature was the way it jumped all over time periods.  Various episodes were set in the Trojan War, the Persian invasion of Greece, the age of Caesar, and one even during a midieval witch-hunt.  And finally there is the way they take a character who talks movingly about temptation and remorse and dress her up like a dominatrix.

3052,When Calls The Heart,"Drama, Western",8.2,"When Calls the Patriarchy

When Calls the Heart has become a grotesque display of the cultural propaganda typical of male-dominated society. Femels are relegated to marriage, children, and home n' hearth. This century, femelkind around the world has experienced increased threats to our safety and economic security. Culturally, we have moved backwards. The burst of femel social progress evidenced in the late 20th century seems to have been oxidized. 

This show could connect with the wymin of today by reflecting on how many wymin were in the past a surprisingly dynamic group of doers and deciders. With all the wedding/marriage/family porn abundant in today's entertainment and media, I would re-title this show 'When Calls The Patriarchy'. Instead of honoring the femel deciders and doers of our past, this show panders to those who clutch on to the apron of yesterday's dearth of freedoms and wealth of injuries. 

The show could feature a femel character to honor Alice Guy, the brilliant mind who invented movies (and the film director) as we know it in the early 20th century. Instead, we get a retired actress, Rosemary, who loves her family but there's always something missing shi finds to do outside of it. Her passion for creativity and progress seems to be stifled by home/hearth. The show could feature another femel character to honor the most successful novelist in word rstory, Agatha Miller. Instead, we get predictably devoted Mom and her cheery son (well-behaved, at least) writing about mundane Life in an economically challenged community shi chose over a financially secure Life with her family elsewhere, better for her son.

When Calls the Heart (for honesty and fairness) once offered us a femel business owner, Fiona (and a beauty!). Now, shi's gone thanks to the glee of When Calls the Patriarchy. Shi could have been turned into a commemorative symbol of Martha Matilda Harper, the brilliant mind and ambitious spirit who invented the business franchise. Instead, we get the wife of a business owner (but, of course!), Florence. Lastly, it would be awesome --- especially considering the crackling contemporary politics recently --- to have a femel character that reminds us of the great Victoria Claflin, the first womin to run for President of the United States. Instead, we're stuck with Lucas, slow and naïve, whose political career was tainted by his past.

3066,Terrace House: Opening New Doors,Reality,7.7,"Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/qXKbcAUCoIU

First there was the big city, then the tropical island, and now the winter forests and mountains of Karuizawa become the home for _Terrace House: Opening New Doors_. We have been burning our way through each version of _Terrace House_ on Netflix, and this one was a monster with 6 parts made up of 49 episodes. 

I think this might be the most enjoyable season for me so far. I think a big part of this is due to the incredible house in the absolutely gorgeous mountains and forests of Nagano prefecture. As a result it was a refreshing change to see the housemates snowboarding, throwing a baseball around the backyard, and generally being much more involved in outdoor activities than housemates in previous seasons. The fact that it had one of my favourite housemates and also one of the best couple get together moments of all three seasons, really made this a good time. 

It did kind of drop off a bit toward in the second half, but picks up again with a series of controversies towards the very end, and all up we really enjoyed it.

3090,Strike,"Crime, Drama, Mystery",7.1,"The first five seasons of UK crime series,""CB Strike"", are quite frankly, brilliant. 

The crime tales which occupy a season of six episodes each are well crafted, complex and compelling, as are the intricate, inherently human and wholly relatable, characterisations. 

Strike who runs a UK detective agency is a cold gruff, sleuthing cliche. Yet,  but as we come to know and understand him, it becomes clear he's a departure from everything he superficially appears to represent. His female partner, balances out Strike,drawing out the softer, kinder, somewhat tragic, side of his character.

In short this is fantastic stuff. The chemistry between the cast members,especially the leads is excellent. 

Regrettably, season six of the series, isn't quite as inspiring. There's a thread of anti-right politicising that paints those on the right as Fascist, racist, misogynists and terrorists. Its ironic too, when you have an allegedly left wing UK government, that is quite literally, imprisoning its citizens, for free speech. 

In summary, a great series that let down by a weak latest season six that saw fit to try its hand at some rather clumsy political indoctrination.

Richard Boone stars as Palladin, the gunman with a card saying ""Have Gun, Will Travel"".
In the days when this was made, he was seen as a forward thinking liberal gunman, even into the sixties and seventies, and especially today.
It was like most TV series in that all the corrupt people were white males, and especially so in this one. A lot of people today don't realize this, but this was how nearly every Western was in the fifties, even on TV.

3123,"Have Gun, Will Travel","Western, Action & Adventure, Drama",7.4,"Have Gun, Will Travel offers, in the character of Paladin, a protagonist who was atypical amongst the lineup of 1950's western drama heroes. He was the erudite gunslinger, the gentleman-bounty hunter, the fixer of situations gone bad and a constrained vigilante. Contrary to what has been written in another review, Paladin didn't seek to play ""god""; however, his line of work may have required that he play any of the roles of judge, jury and executioner, depending on the situation. While not pretending to the status of ""god,"" Paladin could quote with ease passages from the King James Bible or Shakespeare, prior to dispatching the villain at hand. It would also be impossible for Paladin to engage in extensive moralizing, as the show made no pretenses about Paladin's choice to be a gun-for-hire to support his lavish lifestyle and other predilections. Contrary to what has been written in another review, villains were not limited to ""corrupt white men,"" and the series made no off-putting political statements of that ilk. Here, the reader should be reminded that 1950's westerns did feature villainous white men, as well as armed conflict with Indians, Mexican banditos and Comancheros. These were the bread and butter of TV western stories but were not political statements in themselves. Paladin was a considerable thinker, but this is not synonymous with ""liberal,"" as has been claimed in another review.

Many shows from the bygone era of 1950's westerns have aged out of appeal. Have Gun, Will Travel hangs on to its viewing enjoyment, primarily through the complex character and commanding presence of Paladin (Richard Boone). All fictional shows require some suspension of disbelief to achieve immersion in the story; for 1950's westerns, this is less of a stretch than for the litany of modern series pertaining to witches, zombies, vampires and CSI-type police dramas.

""Loki is yet another extraordinary addition to the MCU, delivering a deep study of the eponymous character while introducing the fandom to the beginning of the Multiverse. The writers do a phenomenal job building the TVA and developing its detailed time concept that tremendously impacts the universe without relying too much on exposition, despite a couple of heavy deliveries. From the award-worthy production design to the addictive, memorable score, every technical aspect is near-perfect. However, the performances completely drive the show, mainly Tom Hiddleston as the iconic villain, but Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, and a few others also shine. Mixed feelings about the finale that might be slightly underwhelming for non-comic-book readers, and also about an unconvincing subplot involving Hiddleston and Di Martino. Still, it's the most important series of the MCU so far, so don't you dare miss it!""

3135,Loki,"Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.2,"The God of Mischief is back, and man, does he deliver. _Loki_, the new Marvel series on Disney+, combines the zany inventiveness of _WandaVision_ with the buddy-comedy rapport we were all missing in _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_. Right from the first episode, you know you’re in for a wild, reality-bending ride. With its ambitious, time-hopping premise and eye-popping production design, _Loki_ hits all the right notes, proving Marvel knows exactly how to keep fans on the edge of their seats.

First off, let’s talk about the visuals. Hands down, this show’s VFX are a total game changer—not just for Disney+ content but even for the MCU films. We’re talking mind-blowing cinematography and jaw-dropping set pieces that elevate every scene. The production design is so intricate, you can’t help but lose yourself in this expansive, multiversal playground. Every detail feels iconic, from the retro-futuristic vibes of the Time Variance Authority (TVA) to the gorgeous, apocalyptic landscapes that are straight-up unforgettable.

But it’s not all about the aesthetics—this show has heart and smarts. Loki fans, your boy is finally front and center, and Tom Hiddleston is giving us a Loki with layers we’ve never seen before. Sure, we’ve always known he was the villain with a tragic backstory, but now? Now, Hiddleston is diving deep into identity, purpose, and the big, existential question of free will. His journey feels fresh and, dare I say, more relatable than ever. You can tell Hiddleston is fully trusting the process, and the payoff is some real character evolution that hits differently this time around.

And can we talk about the bromance we didn’t know we needed? Hiddleston and Owen Wilson as Mobius M. Mobius—this duo is pure gold. Their banter is sharp, hilarious, and surprisingly emotional, with Wilson bringing that dry, deadpan humor that balances Loki’s chaotic energy. It’s like your classic grizzled detective paired with an unpredictable trickster, and it’s working, big time. Watching them riff off each other is a joy in itself, adding that much-needed levity while still pushing the plot forward.

The show also brings a lot of heavy Marvel nerd content, especially in the worldbuilding department. Casual fans are going to get hooked by the clever plot twists and quirky TVA shenanigans, but hardcore fans? They’re gonna lose their minds with the deeper, next-level storytelling. _Loki’s_ multiversal misadventures open up so many doors for the MCU that we’ve never seen explored in live-action. The possibilities feel endless, and it’s clear Marvel is laying the groundwork for something massive.

And let’s not forget Sophia Di Martino as Sylvie. Her introduction shakes things up in the best way, providing a fresh dynamic that challenges Loki in ways we haven’t seen before. Without giving too much away, let’s just say Sylvie adds a layer of unpredictability that keeps you on your toes—and the chemistry between her and Hiddleston? Electric.

Halfway through the season, _Loki_ becomes proof that Marvel’s small-screen ventures are more than just filler—they’re expanding the universe in ways that the movies can’t. The show isn’t afraid to lean into its weirdness, and honestly, that’s what makes it so fun. Whether it’s the quirky TVA bureaucracy or the trippy multiverse logic, _Loki_ keeps you glued with its bold, clever storytelling and emotional depth.

With time travel, crime-solving, and a ton of moral questions packed in, _Loki_ is ambitious, stylish, and everything we hoped it would be. It’s that perfect balance of action-packed spectacle and introspective character study. And if the show keeps leaning into that multiverse madness, it’s going to be a glorious ride for fans. This is Loki as we’ve never seen him before—still chaotic, still hilarious, but now? Now, he’s got a shot at real redemption.

I didn't want to just watch the movie and be done with that because I heard a lot of great things about the show and I enjoyed catching a few episodes whenever I was up late on NickToons as a kid. But now I had an excuse to finally watched this certified classic. 

It was overall a great show with a very charming cast of characters. I liked seeing them just be kids without trying to pretend that it's something it isn't. It is just a relaxing slice-of-life show where kids deal with every day problems. The show even dealt with some serious topics which was welcome and very ahead of its time. Arnold is such a compassionate and caring lead, Helga is the living proof that female simps exist and I love seeing all her misadventures, I didn't think Gerald was a  very good friend mostly because how often he sides with the other kids in situations but I did occasionally get a few chuckles out of him, Harold seems to be the stereotypical fat ""bully"", but I like how he isn't just a bully and they don't really lean on his weight problem unless it was the focus of an episode. I love how cheerful Eugene is even when he always gets tortured throughout the series, Sid's excessive nature kinda got on my nerves at a few points, Phoebe was very enjoyable, Rhonda was the best kind of enjoyably unlikable, I wish I had someone like him in my life, and Stinky is the epicest character to ever ever!!! Most of the episodes are just good instead of great and reason I gave it this high rating is because how consistent the quality was. Like for the entire second of the show, there were only 4 to 5 episodes I didn't like which is extremely impressive for an 8-year run. Yeah, it got a little rehashy towards to later seasons and not every character was enjoyable or likable, but that's to be expected, but I think it's good stuff far outweighs its bad. I don't really have a ton to say compared to shows like Scooby-Doo: Mystery Inc. or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003) because its not story-driven, but I didn't really mind.

3172,That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime,"Action & Adventure, Animation, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Comedy",8.5,"It's like a previous reviewer said, this animation, **That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime** (_Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken_)  started out ok.  And the fact it's an anime and included good comedy at the right time got it a lot of points with me.  But my enthusiasm soon boiled down to a simmer.
The fan service is okay.  But it is not enough to carry the show or hold interest for long.  As the show goes on in episodes, the fan service begins to give the series that feel of it being undecided to what kind of Rating the show falls under.  Me no likey confusion.  Me no likey teasing either.

My last con critique about the series is about the main character ""itself.""  That is another point of contention with how I viewed this show.  Here in the western society comic books & animations are being plagued by Liberal ideals: same sex relationships, females in male roles - not just positions - but actual cultural male roles, androgynous drawn characters, and stated social standings of characters being ""non-binary"" and other such liberal nonsense. All of which are poison to good story telling.  
I find myself backing away from this series as the lead character is put in such liberal standing by the writers, who go through the character's current state which is post his death as a fully grown human male.  (In short, they shoe-horned in a liberal stance of the character being ""non-binary"" because slimes can be whatever they want.)

How do I know this??  Easy.  Because the main character started out as a fully grown adult male, and (after his death under plot armor) the writers switched him into a loli based character (a Tween with adult thinking process).  A character, mind you, which they eventually have him take the form of a young female ally who passed away.  And the question becomes, ""Why in the world would a grown man want to turn himself into a being that looks like a 14 year old young woman when he KNOWS he can turn himself into a fully grown adult male??""  As Critical Drinker from Youtube would say, ""...DON'T KNOW!!"" 
But with that realization, and the weak teasing fan service, I (as a male) quickly lost interest in the show.   
A story has to make sense.  And this had gone quite a bit off the rails.  But, I will say it IS entertaining.  So this series can very well be a Go or NO-Go; depending on what you are looking for.  - Peace! -","Miho Okasaki, Megumi Toyoguchi, Tomoaki Maeno, Makoto Furukawa, Sayaka Senbongi","'s like previous reviewer say , animation , * * time get reincarnate slime * * ( _tensei shitara slime datta ken_ ) start ok. fact 's anime include good comedy right time get lot point . enthusiasm soon boil simmer . fan service okay . enough carry show hold interest long . show go episodes , fan service begin give series feel undecided kind rat show fall . likey confusion . likey tease either . last con critique series main character `` .

3172,That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime,"Action & Adventure, Animation, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Comedy",8.5,"""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"" is a consistently beautiful and lively anime that stands out with its excellent pacing. It's rare for an anime to inspire me to read its manga, but this one did, and it even has a Light Novel that the anime enhances remarkably well. 

The main character, Rimuru, is very expressive and a joy to watch. Rimuru's voice acting is perfect, and despite being a genderless slime, its expressions are surprisingly varied. We see how Rimuru impacts the world and interacts with others. While Rimuru is an overpowered protagonist, it isn't the most powerful in the land, adding an interesting dynamic to the story.

The comedy elements blend seamlessly with the story and characters. Comedy is subjective, but I found myself laughing out loud at certain jokes and character expressions. The interactions between characters are engaging, and even side characters contribute meaningfully to the story.

Although primarily light-hearted, the anime can get dark at times and handles these transitions well without hindering the overall experience. The animation quality is top-notch, with impressive details that are not commonly seen. 

In conclusion, ""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"" is a joy to watch. The animation and voice acting enhance the source material, and the character interactions are both interesting and well-executed. It's a must-watch for anime fans, combining humor, action, and emotional depth effectively.","Miho Okasaki, Megumi Toyoguchi, Tomoaki Maeno, Makoto Furukawa, Sayaka Senbongi","`` time get reincarnate slime '' consistently beautiful lively anime stand excellent pace .

3193,Atypical,"Drama, Comedy",8.099,"This show was recommended to us b a relative who have a daughter who resides in the autistic spectrum. Our daughter is atypically autistic herself, but with deafness and a learning disability, she doesn’t resemble  Sam much at all.

It is a very good program overall. We watched the three seasons fairly quickly. I must admit that having Sam talk into the camera at the beginning of every episode, and sometimes during the show, got rather old for me. But it serves the purpose of introducing the theme of each episode, and can fill in details rather quickly. A few of the supporting characters are interesting and they all do a good job, even if a couple of them are nearly stereotypical rather than just Sam’s ‘atypical.’

So I recommend the show and am looking forward to the next series.

*** Having watched the fourth session now, I am adding a few more words. This season (the last maybe?) is more of the same as what came before, which is mostly a good thing. It centers around Sam still but continues to develops subplots around everyone except Evan, who was perhaps too nice a person to continue writing dramatic material for and who is a very minor character now. Everyone else shares in the excellent writing and grow as characters; sometimes in subtle or complex ways, as with Elsa, who clearly exhibits character growth, but who is still who she is.

I know there are a lot of bad reasons to hate good movies and shows: racism, misogyny, class snobbery, a stubborn anger about any kind of change or progress, and so on. But I am having trouble thinking of a reason to hate Atypical. Doing so would perhaps reveal a lot more about the hater  than about the program.

3214,Redo Of Healer,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Crime",8.4,"First and foremost, those looking for a review before watching this **Redo of Healer** (_Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi_) series: It is **NOT** for the Soy-boys, children, or Soccer-moms.  The only reason this anime is not listed under the Hentai labelling is because there are no direct action shots of intercourse.  There **_IS_** a lot of extremely implied sexual acts; meaning there is **NO mistaking** what is taking place.  The abuse in this series is graphic, and _does not spare either gender_!!  
There, now that you have been warned.....

This anime is not isekai, but the story of individuals in a fantasy world who are gifted with abilities.  Unfortunately there are those who would abuse the privilage of power, and they take their full measure of abuse out on the soon-to-be protagonist.  The cruel actions of other gifted individuals along with their Favored standing status with royalty, and their fellow aristocratic gifted individuals allows them to get away their sadistic behavior whereever they go. Not only does the series run through the ""anti-hero's"" abuse at the hands of other gifted heroes, it shows the harmful fetish kinks of the other abusers the realm calls heros.  One adult male hero has an abusive affinity for boys, another female hero is a lesbian that takes advantage of adoring village girls by spiking their drinks and then violating thier semi-unconscious forms.  Another male hero is the run-of-the-mill raptist.  
The story is about the anti-hero bringing these dispicable individuals just revenge for the atrocities they commit, as well as their foul treatment of him.  He has his list of heros to get to, but also his revenge includes the king and his lands as well; the King having sided with the evil heros when false allegations were brought against the anti-hero.  His revenge is plotted on a very wide scale, and he realizes he will need help to get things done.  That is when he either creates his allies from the foul heros he's conquered or buys them as slaves.  
This is another aspect of the series the coddled weak-minded viewers have a problem with.  The wolf girl slave the anti-hero purchases is...not very mature looking.  In order to ensure team unity, the anti-hero keeps **_all_** females engaged regulary as his harem.  There are some things, culturally, that may be ""cringy"" to certain outsiders but this is where having _**the ability to keep your viewing within context is expected!**_  

It is fantasy.  She is a beast person or demi-human.  You don't know how they conduct themselves or how they view such actions unless you watch the series!!  If you jump to the wrong conclusions because of what you believe, then that is on you to resolve.  **The show is not bad becuase you disagree.**  You have a choice like the commenter above. If you don't like it, then don't watch it.  That's what I did with _Overlord_, and people love that series; no matter how bloody inconsistant it is.  
It is widely said that this series is highly contraversal.  I don't get it.  I say watch it for yourself and you decide.  I liked it and I hope it has a conclusive 2nd season.  I want to see how he takes revenge on the remaining two ""heros"" on his list, and how he deals with the king.

3267,Agatha All Along,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery",7.7,"**Betrayal, Ballads, and Big Witch Energy: The Story of _Agatha All Along_**

When _Agatha All Along_ was announced as a spinoff to the acclaimed _WandaVision_, expectations soared. How could anything live up to the vibrant, genre-bending magic of its predecessor? The answer: by conjuring a show that embraces its own quirks, doubles down on emotional storytelling, and takes viewers on a spellbinding ride down the legendary Witches’ Road. Marvel Studios and creator Jac Schaeffer deliver a series that feels simultaneously intimate and expansive—a darkly whimsical tale with Kathryn Hahn’s devious charm at its center.

**Plot and Characters: A Coven of Misfits**

Picking up three years after _WandaVision_, the show begins with Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn) still trapped in her Agnes persona, living a humdrum life as a Westview police detective. It’s a gritty setup with a supernatural twist, as a Jane Doe case and the arrival of Joe Locke’s mysterious Teen catalyze Agatha’s journey to reclaim her identity and power. Alongside her is an eclectic coven: Patti LuPone’s diviner Lilia Calderu, Sasheer Zamata’s potion-wielding Jennifer Kale, Ali Ahn’s haunted Alice Wu-Gulliver, and Aubrey Plaza’s enigmatic Rio Vidal (aka Lady Death). Each character brings a distinct energy, and their uneasy alliance is rife with tension and begrudging camaraderie.

Kathryn Hahn continues to dazzle as Agatha, infusing every line with delicious wit and layered vulnerability. Her scenes with Aubrey Plaza are a highlight, their simmering chemistry electric as they navigate a past steeped in betrayal. Plaza, playing the sardonic, chaotic Vidal, commands attention, especially when her true nature as Death is revealed in Episode 7. Joe Locke’s Teen provides a surprising emotional anchor, and his mysterious connection to Agatha hints at the deeper wounds she carries.

**Themes and Tone: A Witchy Adventure with Depth**

Jac Schaeffer’s magic lies in balancing spectacle with substance. While the Witches’ Road is a visually surreal marvel, complete with vivid colors and practical effects that evoke an ’80s horror vibe, the series shines brightest when exploring its themes. At its core, _Agatha All Along_ is a story of redemption, self-discovery, and power. It doesn’t shy away from the darker roots of witchcraft, confronting themes like misogyny and generational trauma while celebrating the strength of its female characters.

This tonal balance extends to the writing, which skillfully marries campy humor with poignant moments. Agatha’s transformation back to herself in Episode 1 is a standout—a noir detective peeling away layers of forced personas to reclaim her truth. The show also embraces episodic storytelling, with trials on the Witches’ Road that test the coven’s unity and personal resilience. From Alice’s haunting family curse to Jennifer’s struggle to reclaim her bound powers, each arc adds richness to the overarching journey.

**Standout Episodes: A Spellbinding Journey**

Among the nine episodes, several stand out as masterclasses in storytelling:

**Episode 1: “Seekest Thou the Road”** establishes Agatha’s fragmented identity with a detective noir twist, culminating in her cathartic reawakening.
**Episode 3: “Through Many Miles / Of Tricks and Trials”** takes the coven to the eerie Witches’ Road Mansion, blending psychological horror with a trial of poison and hallucinations.
**Episode 7: “Death’s Hand in Mine”** delivers a haunting blend of sacrifice and revelation as Lilia Calderu’s ultimate act of redemption unravels her fragmented life, while Rio’s shocking identity as Death shatters the coven’s fragile trust in a tarot-laden trial of fate and free will.
**Episode 9: “Maiden Mother Crone”** wraps up the Witches’ Road saga with an emotional finale that leaves Agatha poised for future adventures while resolving the coven’s trials in deeply satisfying ways.

**Visuals and Style: Practical Magic at Its Finest**

Visually, _Agatha All Along_ is a feast. Its practical effects—a conscious departure from CGI-heavy Marvel fare—lend the series a tactile, almost dreamlike quality. Every magical element, from the fog-draped Witches’ Road to the eerie glow of fireflies, was crafted with painstaking attention to detail. The commitment to practical effects extended to action sequences, such as Episode 7’s dramatic sword drop, where actual metal blades were dropped from the ceiling with precision mapping, adding an edge of realism and danger.

The Witches’ Road, in particular, stands out as a masterstroke of set design. Built twice to achieve the perfect scale, the final version is a rich tapestry of mud pits, mushrooms, and glowing flora—all filmed in-camera to enhance its tangible, studio-bound aesthetic. This hands-on approach immersed the actors in the environment, bringing authenticity to their performances and grounding the fantastical elements of the series in reality. The physical demands of navigating the road’s uneven terrain, paired with the magical atmosphere created by fog and glowing mushrooms, enhanced both the storytelling and the visual experience.

By embracing practical effects and studio-built sets, the series pays homage to the golden age of fantasy filmmaking while adding layers of depth to its narrative. This approach makes the Witches’ Road feel like a character in its own right—otherworldly, dangerous, and entirely unforgettable. Music plays a recurring role, too, with the _Ballad of the Witches’ Road_ threading through key moments, adding a haunting resonance.

**Final Thoughts: A Bewitching Success**

While it doesn’t quite match _WandaVision’s_ genre-defining brilliance, _Agatha All Along_ forges its own path, embracing its quirks and delivering an emotionally resonant, spellbinding tale.

The world is not perfect. Parents argue, fight, get separated, and sadly get divorced; or a parent abandons their child. Whatever the reasons were of the adults, the most that is affected are their children. The world that turns into darkness are the world of the people adults brought into this harsh reality.

Suji and Uri showed us that this shouldn't be the case, and that we can achieve healing in one way or another. We may hate someone for what they did, but we shouldn't let that turn into bitterness. Suji and Uri taught us that forgiveness is a path that all of us can take, because the people who benefits the most from having a forgiving heart is no other than the person who learned to forgive. And that's where healing  begins and we start seeing the light.

Which then leads to having a heart of gold to take care of other people going through hardships in life, like we did, and potentially adopt children who deserves to have beautiful world.

3320,M*A*S*H,"War & Politics, Drama, Comedy",7.91,"This Korean War medical team unit is really two shows.
So, it's rated in two parts.
MASH is sort of four different shows. I've read the book. I've seen the movie, and I've seen the two different formats of the TV show.
The book was much like the first show, where Major Burns is a total scapegoat. There's no way to believe that Hawkeye is a god and Burns is responsible for every terrible thing that ever happened. 
That's the book and the Larry Linville portion of the series. Linville himself knew this was a career ending role, and that the character of Burns was ridiculous.
It did make for funny moments, but the same funny moments that Nazis endorsed when they made Jews their scapegoats.
The first part of MASH is simply an instruction manual for choosing a scapegoat. 
When people watch something like this, they aren't concerned with ""reality"". They're being taught a more. The more being taught isn't to blame the creepy guy for creepy things that he does. That's because no one really knows that much about anyone else.
What is being taught, and the writers and directors of all books and TV shows and movies know this, is the surface view. What is being taught in MASH before Stiers is to just pick a scapegoat. That's all. That's the message.
So, even though the slapstick humor is funny, I give the first era of the TV show a 1/10. It's teaching discrimination and hate without a cause. 
During the first portion, the surgical army unit doctors do perform in a realistic setting, so to speak, and that makes it worse, because it can't be laughed away when they teach people to be modern day Nazis looking for the modern day Jew. Totally worse. 
It's also very dated, because it doesn't take into account the date. Being ""dated"" is misunderstood by ""fan boys"". It doesn't mean what they think. They think it means people from 1952 who act like characters from 1953 are dated. They think a character from 1952 should know about eight track tapes, DVDs, Donald Trump, etc. 
Being ""dated"" actually means that someone from 1952 does know about eight track tapes, DVDs, and Donald Trump. That's ""dated"".
That's the problem with MASH. The ""liberal"" from 1952 would be more like Trapper John. He would be the very far left. Hawkeye would be shot as a traitor, no matter how good of a doctor he claimed he was.
Which is another thing. The MASH book and the Linville era of MASH is like listening to Sinbad tell Hindbad of his voyages. You know he's lying. There's no credibility of character.
Now, the later MASH sees the writers realizing what they've done. Stiers as Winchester is the most credible character of the entire series. This is what a doctor in 1952 would be. Also Honeycutt and Potter. The characters became much more credible, though the humor became drier.
The later part of the series was 9/10. There were still some bits of contrived propaganda, but it was much subtler.
The character of Nurse Hot Lips was worse than that of Burns. She was a worse monster than he was. She had no allegiance at all, and couldn't be trusted. She tried to make underlings nervous in a war zone where being nervous could kill or cripple you, and that cannot be an accident from a major. I kept hoping she would be fragged. There is no way you could trust that monster to be on your side.
The character of Father Mulcahy was also out of touch with the era. He was the epitome of ""dated"", being a 1990 liberal preacher in 1942. As far as credibility goes, he was as bad as Burns.
It was later in the series when the four non coms got more notice. There was always Radar and Klinger, but they were extreme polar opposites. The Rizzo and Igor were added, and they were a bit extreme, even for 1942. Still, they gave more of a balance. Especially Igor, although his character should have been written better, since he was the ""moderate"" enlisted man. As a moderate, for instance, he shouldn't have been from the New York-New Jersey area. That was too contrived to please that area.
The ""scapegoat"" era was so corrupt that it took the rating down for this more than just 1 and 9 equals 10 for an average of 5. Thus, it gets a 4/10 rating.","Alan Alda, Mike Farrell, Harry Morgan, Loretta Swit, David Ogden Stiers","korean war medical team unit really two show . , 's rat two part . mash sort four different show .

3332,Mr. Bean,"Comedy, Family, Drama",7.954,"**Probably one of the most effective and beloved comedy series ever.**

For people like me, who grew up in the 90s, Mr. Bean is certainly one of the best and most nostalgic pieces of television ever made, as well as being one of the best series made in Europe. It's really hard to think that there were only fourteen episodes when it seems, to our eyes, that there were several dozen. Without great visual artifices, without particular care for the scenery (Bean's apartment is never exactly the same between episodes and there are other subtle changes), with the soundtrack reduced to a minimum (the song used at the beginning and end, “Ecce homo qui est faba”) without concerns about verisimilitude, all the episodes do what they set out to do: make everyone laugh.

Each episode lasted about half an hour and could be watched by any type of person, even on a lunch break for someone whose work requires them to have lunch outside the home. The protagonist, Bean (we will never know if he ever had a name other than “Mr.”), is a perfectly ordinary man, but much more idiotic than most people (except, perhaps, a notable portion of the employees). public), and the various episodes clearly show the mishaps and embarrassing situations that happen in his life. And we laughed... but who, after all, has never experienced at least one situation so bizarre or embarrassing that it could have been carried out by Bean?

The actor who gave body and soul to the character is the inimitable Rowan Atkinson. He is, without a doubt, a good actor, but Bean was that character that brought out the best in the actor, that character that he conceived and tailored to his abilities and talent, and that can never be played decently any longer. nobody. And as almost always happens in cases like these, the character stuck to the actor as if she were a second skin, and it is understandable that Atkinson preferred to reform her, even though her popularity seems to prevent an absolute reform: Bean still appears, in a very punctual way, whether for a commercial advertisement or for a special appearance, as happened at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. After all, along with the late Elizabeth II and the many faces that were once James Bond, Bean is certainly the most recognizable and loved Brit in the world.",Rowan Atkinson,"* * probably one effective beloved comedy series ever . * * people like , grow 90s , mr. bean certainly one best nostalgic piece television ever make , well one best series make europe .

**SEASON 02:**

It's a cool series. But I did not think they would renew it for the second season. The episodes were doubled, and I think it deserved that, because each episode were very enjoyable. The first season was an intro, but I felt very comfortable with this. More characters added, though the romance side of the tale is yet to be tapped. Maybe I think I know how it's going to turn out, but the finale of this season created more curiosity, going for the third. Yes, they have renewed the series, that's a wonderful news and it is going to be aired at the end of this year (2017).

I love the cast. I won't say it was just America Ferrera and Ben Feldman's show, but each and everyone had their own space with their awesome characters. It is definitely going to be one of the best NBC comedy programme. As how this ended, I think it is going to be kind of a restart in the next season. But still I hope it stays the same, particularly retains all the characters, and maybe a couple of new ones as well.

Since I haven't reviewed the first season, I wanted to say that it kind of looks inspired by 'Employee of the Month', but they say it was a crossover of 'Mindy Project' starred by Ferrera. I haven't seen that, but that looks nice, maybe one day I'll check it out. At first, I thought it was good for all ages, but there are some jokes regarding sex. Not that explicit though. I believe it'll only get better going forward and flourish like ABC's 'Young & Hungry'. It is just a two season young programme and I would surely suggest for those who are interested in comedy to start now to keep up with its original pace.

Yeah, I'm from the walkman era. The cassettes, tape recorder, I've lived in the final days of that time enjoying all of them. I still have some old tapes saved somewhere that I've to locate them, but I've no device to place them. Anyway, when I heard about this series, how those previous technology was used to narrate a thriller drama, I was so happy. Each episode named after the how many tapes used, and its sides. Maybe the new generation won't understand that. Though the story matters, what it was focused and unfolding the truth, the message was great.

One of the top rated debut from the 2017. The Netflix usually strikes the gold, and so with this. After so many good reviews, I wanted to see it to learn what's that all about. In the end, I did not get disappointed. But it was not that great, except the message, a very important message in the present world. I thought they dragged it. The whole season. I think it should have been only half of those total episodes. So the plots would have got tighter and faster narration. That suicide scene really terrified me. It was too strong, definitely I'm against showing that to youngsters.

It was about a boy who receive a box of tapes from the dead girl. The girl who committed suicide, so she has recorded these tapes telling what made her to take this terrible decision. All those influenced in her life to her death gets the tape and finally how it all ends is the mystery told in the final episode. But before that, how the tale develops among the guys who are involved in it decides to stop this attempt. It's not that easily stopped and reasons are revealed.

Initially I thought it was one season thing, but now after the final episode, I think definitely season two is on. They have announced it as well now. Well acted and made with the production. Many actors you can point out, but Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford topped the list. There's more to come or I'm expected in the following season than what this season has revealed. So I think I'm going like that more than this. It's too early, but there's a very little it to get wrong. I hope that's where it ends, but they could be tempted to extend the series. Anyway, a nice watch. It will remain one of the best from the streaming giant! So watch it sooner than later!

3376,13 Reasons Why,"Drama, Mystery",7.594,"13 Reasons Why does indeed make suicide seem glamorous. It's a dangerous message. Hannah Baker made a lot of bad choices throughout the series. She was attracted to dangerous, selfish boys, she dismissed the nice ones, and failed to help her friend as she was being violated just a few feet away in the same room. She drank herself silly, put importance in stupid, shallow things and then decided the best place to strip down to her bra and panties was in the hot tub of the very same boy who she just watched rape her friend. As she is taking it deep in her sniz from behind, is she really surprised? Of course, there is never an excuse to rape. However, a female must be aware of risky situations. If you are prone to getting black-out drunk or stoned or you commonly end up nude or semi-nude in rapists' hot tubs, your odds of being taken advantage of go up exponentially.

Season 2 is even more maddening than the 1st. Why? Because it goes out of its way to paint all females as natural born victims who are at the mercy of evil boys and men... ALL THE TIME.  Nothing is a girl's fault. Ever. As if that message isn't bad enough, Hannah gets to take a break from Heaven so she can return to Earth as a ghost and see how completely devastated people are without her. This will inevitably inspire real suicides of narcissistic dummies who feel the world revolves around them and their stupid romance problems. What many dolts don't realize is that when you are dead, YOU ARE DEAD. You don't get to watch everybody melt down because your awesome self is gone. It's over. FOREVER.

In conclusion, ultimately, NOBODY cares about who you are crushing on or who is manipulating your genitalia. Why not do your homework and take some time off from being an annoying idiot?

3376,13 Reasons Why,"Drama, Mystery",7.594,"The rollercoaster that started with Hannah Baker and her titular motivations that drove her to suicide has finally come to a full stop. Everyone involved in the infamous tapes are damaged beyond repair, regardless what happinesses they find, and no one more than our protagonist Clay Jensen, whose conflict takes on the most phantasmagorical in the final ten episodes.

For a show that's gone on as long as **_13 Reasons Why_** (and, let's be real, it really didn't need to surpass one season), the melodrama keeps piling on. The first season is not without its faults but it's superior to everything that follows. Season 2 was one long, dragged out snoozer that hit no bumps until the finale, which brought us what is singlehandedly the most uncomfortable scene in the entire series (perhaps even Netflix overall). Yes, even more than the (now removed) bathtub suicide at the end of season 1.

While season 3 was a marked improvement over 2, ignoring the question of ""why the hell is this still on?"", at least new character Ani came in with something resembling a backstory, because that can't be said for any other new characters, although her use becomes extremely problematic (I'll give you a hint, it involves redeeming a rapist). A number of supporting players come into play in the second and third seasons, and then vanish with next to no explanation.

The writers room seem to have little idea how contemporary teenagers act, peppering every other word with an F bomb and their lives is one giant soap opera. This may be how some Gen Z'ers see their existence but **_13RW_** is next level. Bullying that leads to suicide is all too unfortunately common, yet has anyone (prior to the show's release) actually gone out of their way to record who they blame for the ultimate decision?

One thing I will credit the series as a whole is the committed performances of its young actors (_young_ is a strong word, considering the actor behind sociopathic school bully Montgomery is in his early thirties). With the material they're given, Katherine Langford (Hannah), Miles Heizer (Alex), Alisha Boe (Jessica), Brandon Flynn (Justin), Timothy Granaderos (Monty)--especially come season 4--really play out their strengths. But the most notable performance has to go to Devin Druid as the ambiguously disordered yearbook photographer Tyler.

Tyler's journey is, without a doubt, the most harrowing and heartbreaking arc, because he may as well be one of the realest depictions of a teenager--regardless of generation--on TV. He's a nice enough kid but he's singled out by everyone around him as weird and--in the case of the aforementioned tapes--seen as one of the worst subjects (his offense being a stalker), despite said tapes including a serial rapist, a pathological liar, a cowardly educator, a backstabbing friend and a slut-shamer.

The character development award goes to Brandon Flynn, who brings Justin Foley, a troubled boy from a broken and abusive home life, to life. The book that the series is based on doesn't go into that much detail but Flynn's downtrodden demeanor plays perfect to Justin's addiction storyline. He goes from gaslighting his girlfriend about being raped and solving problems with vague threats of violence to someone the audience really roots for, a protective and caring adopted brother to Clay. That is, until his life on the streets catches up to him and he's revealed to have contracted AIDS somewhere down the line. This is given a passing comment somewhere mid-season 4 and brought up in the extended length series finale.

Not sure who to pin that on, I guess the showrunners wanted to go out on something big. And nothing says big like offing a major and well-developed character (who's played by a gay man) with outdated representations of a controversially depicted disease in the final 90 minutes of your show.

**_Before you continue reading, be aware my review will contain spoilers._**

I watched first season and this is the conclusion I made from these series: Hannah Baker (girl who killed herself) was a drama queen who made a lot of mistakes, weren't very bright in her head and instead of making things right, she decided to end her own life and blame others. She was definitely a stupid girl. Who doesn't get bullied in school? I got bullied too when I was a kid. I'm pretty sure lots of you got bullied too, but it doesn't mean you need to kill yourself. You move on and concentrate on more important things like your future and study instead of those moron teenagers. From everything that I saw in a first season I saw crime only twice: Raping and sexual harrasment. Hannah saw how her classmate got raped by other classmate. She got harrased several times sexually by the same person and another person (Marcus, in a restaurant), yet instead of telling parents and going to Police station, she kept it quite. But what's most stupid thing she did was going at night to the rapist's house party & getting half naked in his hot tub which apparently she ended up being raped by him. Seriously, what did you expect? You know that, this guy is a rapist, yet you go to his house party at night, get in his hot tub half naked and end up with him alone in the tub? How dumb you must be to do that? But her stupidity doesn't end up there. After she gets raped by that guy, instead of finally going to Police station, again she keeps it as a secret and acts like nothing happens. Later she visits school council and tries to tell him about it, but she doesn't. She just gives him some puzzled answers when council is asking the right questions. Eventually he tells her that ""either you speak up about it and we will try to help, either you move on"", because if victim doesn't speak out about it, then no one can help them. It's the only way. And as always, Hannah fails here too and refuses to admit what happened and instead decides to kill herself and then records audio cassettes where she blames a lots of kids for her suicide, even good kids that didn't deserve it. For example, Ryan publishes her poem without her consent because he thinks whatever she wrote was beautiful (it's clear his intentions are good), yet Hannah gets upset and puts his name on the list of her bullies. Yeah, these kids are teenagers, they're not perfect, they will make mistakes, it's normal. All in all, I think Hannah was just a suicidal girl who would still kill herself soon or later in her life because she was too much sensitive snowflake + dumb and usually those two things don't mix well. If not this school, I'm pretty sure somewhere something else would still provoke her to end her life, maybe her coworker would say something mean or etc... Bottom line is that: Life's not perfect. Teenagers aren't perfect. Kids can be mean and bullies, but you move on and if you encounter any serious crime like rape, you go to Police station and speak about it! Things that Hannah didn't do. In general, she was a stupid girl who made lots of mistakes.

Second season is better. Not much to say about it, but it's more interesting.

Third season is already showing signs of propaganda. Jessica turns into some feminist crazy person. It's also dragging and slow and they put this new character Ani - African girl as a main character to narrate. Her character is so shallow, boring and uninteresting. She's horrible. Everything about her is annoying, her voice, her personality, her lies, EVERYTHING. She came out of left field, doesn't even fit with the original characters. And her stupid accent doesn't help either. She feels like creators of show just decided to take her and put her in this show because of her stupid accent. She feels like she doesn't belong in this show. God, she's so boring and annoying... Every time I hear her accent I want to turn off this show. Ending is also crap. Alex kills Bryce. Cold-hearted feminist Jessica doesn't help and they let Bryce drown and this stupid African guild covers them and blames on Monty.

Fourth season is worst of all seasons. It's a pure LGBT propaganda! I counted and 12 characters turns out gays! I think it's too much and not even realistic at all. This season is just a pure political agenda. Libtards are pushing it hard here, even making prom king and queen two king gay couples who everyone applaudes even their own parents. And Jessica character still being crappy feminist woke shit. It feels like that some libtard feminist LGBT American teenager wrote this garbage shit. It's a pure crap. I'm giving it 3/10, because story's not that bad, but this woke shit propaganda ruins the show. Lastly, thankfully, we don't have that annoying UK accent girl narrating the story.

Saddest thing is that US used to make best shows and movies in the past, like in 90's and early 2000, but all they make nowadays is a pure garbage propaganda. This country turned into some politically propaganda country with lowest quality for movies and shows. It's just sad.","Dylan Minnette, Grace Saif, Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn","* * short summery : tv show start good , turn crap wake political show . * * 1. season okay 2. season better 3. season bad start show sign wake propaganda 4. season worst pure propaganda * * _before continue read , aware review contain spoilers._ * * watch first season conclusion make series : hannah baker ( girl kill ) drama queen make lot mistake , n't bright head instead make things right , decide end life blame others . definitely stupid girl . n't get bully school ? get bully kid .

Those who grew up with the memories of the original animation series, here is a bad news  for you. This live action is an absolute abomination!

It had a promising start, and the first 3 episodes were enjoyable. Eventually, the new writers’ plague took over and turned everything into a mess. They literally changed the original story and  made it to deliver “the message”! The last 3 episodes were so bad, I wanted them to end it already. I am not going to go into details, but here are the good and bad from my perspective:

GOOD:
1. I liked the casting. The actors look like the original animation series characters.
2. Zuko is a good actor. His uncle on the other hand seems goofy.
3.Some good CGI.

BAD:
1. Bad acting, direction, dialogues.
2. No character building or chemistry between characters.
3. The storyline is changed dramatically, which looks like any other Netflix girl boss series. E.g. God forbid if water bending women had to take the nurturing and healing role. They must fight into the battle and stand up against the patriarchy. Katara beating Zuko’s ass, Azula is the ultimate warrior, and so on. These days you simply can’t entertain yourself without being lectured about something. 🤦🏻‍♂️

Overall, extremely bad remake (if you want to call it one). I would rather watch the animation series again than waste my time on this crap.

I have a huge crush on him and I really like Yang Yang. This drama makes you really motivated because the female lead along with her friends' support keeps improving in taekwondo. The theme song is also pretty motivating. Yang Yang who plays Ruo Bai plays his character extremely well. He doesn't smile but when he does, it makes me squeal. His voice is also deep and sounds really nice, not to mention that he is really handsome. The female lead is a bit repetitive because she adds senior behind all her senior taekwondo competitors. However, she does a pretty good job otherwise. The story isn't super creative but I really like how they focus on taekwondo. Without the taekwondo, it would be more of a typical drama.

Where to begin? Well, the first episode was boring, but I stayed with the hope that something nice would happen. I wasn’t wrong, as episodes 2 and 3 were really good. They started introducing new characters and developed their personalities. Unfortunately, after that, the writers' and directors' weaknesses started showing up as the story feels really illogical and disjointed.

Bad acting, unnecessary and illogical fights. Need not to mention, I hate this new Hollywood trend (especially Marvel) where they play 1960s music and show fight scenes in slow motion. You can like it for once or twice, but this crap has been shoved down the throat in every movie these days. This series was nauseatingly full of such scenes.

The storyline is so weak, no one knows why people are doing something? The Garfield-eyed protagonist is very annoying and stupid. She is supposed to be looking for her father, but meanwhile, she seems bubbly and cheerful, literally asking someone to have sex with her, unnecessarily spying on a vault people… why???

As if this was not enough, the series gets worse from episode 4 onwards. But this time all the nuts and bolts of this stupid series start coming off, and no one knows what’s happening. They tried to show unnecessary gore, violence, and disgust to give “shock treatment” to their viewers and get some attention, but after some time, even that feels annoying and boring.

I give it 3/10.

3423,Unforgotten,"Drama, Crime, Mystery",7.7,"This is one of a handful of current British police procedural programs that I think of as elite, nearly perfect. (Think Versa, think DCI Banks, think Shetland.) I don’t mean literally perfect: every show disappoints at times or drops the ball briefly, but you don’t notice or care.

The show is a slow burner, for obvious reasons. There are no serial killers on the loose, no hostage situations or thrilling car chases. The cases Cassie’s team investigates are old. They are hindered by the fact that before they can question witnesses, research possible suspects or persons of interest, they need to identify the identity and cause of death of victims who were p=killed, 10, 20 or 50 years before.

The investigative team works together well, and the ensemble cast take turns helping the cases with their hard work. And as in the shows I listed above, their work and our attention are not distracted by the hot mess of a personal life of their leader. Cassie, Vera, DCI Banks, they have personal issues that come up, but they are the kind of problems we might all have.

3427,Dimensional Warrior Spielban,"Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",9.2,"I have very few complaints about this show. If I have any, it’s just going to be in comparison with the visuals/music of Gavan but that’s A: always going to be the case for “Space Sheriff”-styled Metal Heroes shows, which I believe this is the last of em, and B: kind of unfair because this has a lot going for it otherwise. Actually the music in this is pretty good, but it’s no Akira Kushida, so there’s a limit to how good it will be.

What makes Spielvan stand out are the characters. It’s a meatier, and a more dynamic show because it’s not just hero + female sidekick and one-dimensional villains. It’s hero + female hero + female hero who is being held captured by the villains, of which there are a LOT and they are pretty much all great. Basically a lot of badass female characters on both sides of justice. Not the least of which Machiko Soga. I feel like every show that has her as the villain is automatically a better show than it would be without. Her commitment is just second to none. I put her on the same level as having Kenji Ohba as the protagonist.
Speaking of the protagonist… Hiroshi Watari is someone I don’t have strong feelings about, but Spielvan as a show is less reliant on him than Sharivan which is why it didn’t ever bother me. 

I also don’t remember a lot of episodes that were duds, which Juspion had quite a few of. There’s a good variety of goofs, just monster of the week, recurring character-based plots that wrap up in a satisfying way, and weird new elements being introduced throughout like Dr. Bio being reduced to a floating, talking brain with googly eyeballs and basically EVERYTHING involving Mickey Curtis’ character and his time-traveling, talking, but otherwise completely normal ass looking hamster.
Maybe the action isn’t super inspired, but the set pieces become snappier and they change stuff up ever so slightly every couple of episodes so you don’t get too bored with it (again, looking at EVERY Daileon fight in Juspion which I endured mostly because of the theme song). 

Also I can't 100% say because I got too bored to finish Sharivan and Shaider, but if you did and you get around to Spielvan, it might feel like a ""metal heroes greatest hits"" remix kind of show? Curious about that, but on its own I loved it.","Hiroshi Watari, Makoto Sumikawa, Naomi Morinaga, Ichiro Mizuki, Shozo Iizuka","complaints show . , ’ go comparison visuals/music gavan ’ : always go case “ space sheriff ” -styled metal heroes show , believe last em , b : kind unfair lot go otherwise . actually music pretty good , ’ akira kushida , ’ limit good . make spielvan stand character . ’ meatier , dynamic show ’ hero + female sidekick one-dimensional villains . ’ hero + female hero + female hero hold capture villains , lot pretty much great . basically lot badass female character side justice . least machiko soga . feel like every show villain automatically better show would without . commitment second none . put level kenji ohba protagonist . speak protagonist… hiroshi watari someone ’ strong feelings , spielvan show less reliant sharivan ’ ever bother . also ’ remember lot episodes duds , juspion quite . ’ good variety goof , monster week , recur character-based plot wrap satisfy way , weird new elements introduce throughout like dr. bio reduce float , talk brain googly eyeball basically everything involve mickey curtis ’ character time-traveling , talk , otherwise completely normal ass look hamster . maybe action ’ super inspire , set piece become snappier change stuff ever slightly every couple episodes ’ get bore ( , look every daileon fight juspion endure mostly theme song ) . also ca n't 100 % say get bore finish sharivan shaider , get around spielvan , might feel like `` metal heroes greatest hit '' remix kind show ? curious , love .",1,1
3429,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated,"Animation, Mystery, Family",8.224,"*SPOILER REVIEW*

After watching so many underwhelming projects from the Scooby-Doo franchise lately, seeing something that not only pays a loving tribute to the original ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" series, but also expanding and improving upon elements in new and interesting ways that doesn't feel wrong and out of place is so mind boggling to me.

Like i knew going in that this was going to a joy to watch, but my first impression of the first few episodes was't too high. I like the idea of Shaggy and Velma dating at the beginning only for them to break up because they have so little in common, that it would ultimately be a very unhealthy relationship, but i feel like them dragging that plot point out for the first 10 episodes felt a bit tedious. Shaggy and Velma want it to work out, but you know it's not gonna last and I feel like they should ended their relationship in the first 5 episodes.  This is when Scooby becomes really unlikable for these first few episodes where he hates the idea of sharing Shaggy with Velma even though later in the series, Scooby gets his own girlfriend and Shaggy doesn't mind at all. So the show runners just made him unlikable for the sole reason of splitting up Shaggy and Velma. Daphne's dialogue 95% of the time just boiled down to ""Will Fred F^$% me?"" and she barely has any personality out of that, but thankfully she get's better later in the series and it is really sweet when Fred and Daphne finally get together. Fred  was perfectly fine for a bit, he's admiration for traps is cranked up to 11 and it is very funny if you want to think about in anime logic. I heard somewhere that the best character in Scooby-Doo history was Mystery Incorporated's iteration of Fred and for most of the first season, I didn't see it. But when we get to Fred's parents, it get's really interesting. So it turns out that apparently Fred's mom that he thought died was just a photo from a magazine and the person that he saw as his father his whole life stole him when Fred was a baby from his real parents which is such a betrayal because we got to grow attached to these characters for the entire duration of season 1. But what's most heartbreaking is that even though the mayor practically treated Fred like dirt and Fred always trying to get his dad's approval, he was more of a loving and compassionate father than his supposed ""real"" parents. 

The overall mystery was really well done and cool, but this is where I get to one of my other problems, the mysteries are some of the predictable they have ever been in Scooby-Doo history. I learned overtime that there is a trade-off with Scooby-Doo mysteries. Either A, a mystery has around 5 suspects,but ultimately feels overbloated with undeveloped characters that the episodes has to divide it's time with or B, a mystery has about 2 suspects, but usually one is just too obvious to be the suspect and that's where the predictability comes in. Option B is does give an episode a tighter script, but it  doesn't lead to a strong mystery. 

The side characters were honestly pretty good. Patrick Warburton as Sheriff Stone was really enjoyable and the sexual tension between him and Mayor Jones was on another on another level, but no, they had to give him a girlfriend in the form as the OTHER mayor which is sad because my fan-fiction will never come to light now :(. uh, I don't know if this is a hot take or not, but I didn't like Hot Dog Water very much as a character. I really can't take her seriously with her name and design and she's just really a discount version of Velma and I didn't see her and Velma as a romantic pairing, like at all, but her ultimate sacrifice was well done and a good send-off for her as a character. Mr E and Professor Pericles was both great villains and very intimating and some of the best Scooby-Doo has to offer. The Vincent Young tribute character was funny, I wish they actually gave Skipper Shelton some focus in a episode, Gary and Ethan for pretty much chads, the parents were (mostly) a delight, and The Hex Girls cameo appearances are at least better than the one in Legend of the Vampire.

Another problem I have with this show is it's commentary. It was alright in the first episode, but I guess the writers completely don't know what the meaning of ""subtle"" is.  It's so on the nose and frequent that it starts to just become annoying and preachy. Like I came to watch a Scooby-Doo cartoon, not a critique on the American Legal System. The only way I see that actually working and being effective if it way more restrained and a lot more subtle.

Overall great show, it still has it's problems no doubt, but the amount of good things in it just makes it, for me, the Scooby-Doo media ever made and I will take that to my grave if I must.

3442,Star Blazers [Space Battleship Yamato] 2199,"Action & Adventure, Animation, Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, War & Politics",7.3,"A fairly interesting and more adult update of the classic space operate anime fare out of Japan.  Unlike the original TV show which was ostensibly aimed at pre-teen boys and younger, this show has a kind of post teen target audience in mind with lots of introspection, some romantic and sexual tension, and overall a more reflective film making style that brings a kind of depth and artistry that the first series from decades earlier did not have.

As an adult American male I think I can safely say that I have enjoyed watching this series without feeling too nostalgic about for the series that I liked as a young boy.  But, on that same note I think I can safely say that I understand both TV series as being a kind of wish fulfillment for a segment of Japanese youth whose parents or family as a whole have conservative or martial reflections and leanings for what used to be the Empire of Japan.  Even so, in spite of some flagrant jingoism in the first episode, the series does try to convey a message of brotherhood among mankind and alien adversaries bent on Earth's destruction.  And it seems that the attempt here is to acknowledge military spirit of conservative Japan, but also to help educate and steer younger generations with impressionable minds to a more reasoned outlook.

The real high here are the very high production values for the series.  The new animation combines CGI with traditional cel animation and excellent artwork to update the original series with a very pristine and clean look that has a strong artistic appeal.  

Still, it is an animated show regarding a ""space battleship"", and the updated production values somehow seem at odds with the show's plausibility.  Still, it's pretty entertaining for what it is.  If you're an older viewer who remembers the original Japanese import with any fondness, then maybe give this series a shot.  The blurays have the benefit of having English subtitles for overseas viewers.

3457,Final Space,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Comedy",8.4,"I've been waiting for Final Space for quite some time. I loved the pilot on the creator's YouTube channel, and I knew it could be great. Overall, I think Final Space fulfilled expectations. 

Season 1 was full of introductions, but in ten 22-minute episodes, they managed to tell a story worth telling _and_ make me feel for the characters. There were legitimately sad moments in this animated comedy, which isn't something that can always be said about these types of shows. Olan Rogers, the creator, did a fantastic job of teasing out emotions while still filling the show with the comedy he's known for. 

The season did a decent job of balancing surface-level comedy with deeper, more thoughtful laughs, even if it did lean towards the surface a few too many times. It's forgivable, though. 

The absolute highlight of this show is the characters. From Gary's fantastic personal growth to the development of Avocato and Quinn, the show shines in its people. Even characters that don't ""grow"" as much as are revealed like HUE, KVN, and Mooncake add a lot of emotion and emphasis to the show. 

While the characters are great, the main antagonist seems to fall a little short. That's not to say Lord Commander is a bad character or even a bad villain. He's not, it's just that the rest of the characters set the bar high. He's seen as a real threat, which is an accomplishment, but he doesn't get enough screen time to get fully fleshed out, although that's probably alright. 

This show really hits its stride around episode eight. The last three episodes of the season are my favorite, and the emotional buildup and release happen to be one of the best in an animated series. 

The season also ended in a great way. The arc is wrapped up well, and if the show would never come back, I'd be satisfied. They also left just enough left to spur on curiosity and interest in a second season. 

My average episode score ended at 8.4 for the season, but the way they fit together as a tidy arc gives this enough of a boost to get to 9.

3459,Primal,"Action & Adventure, Animation, Drama",8.612,"<b><i>Primal, for the very brief run it has been on in 3 years, sets an exemplary tone of adult animated shows can be more than ""complex inter galactic warfare brimmed with meta-humour and anti-meta-narrative"" or to simply put ""haha, sex is funny"" or ""laugh in the misery of the supposed glassed virgin,"" or ""haha, depressed guy taking drugs, hope they get better soon"" which sadly has been the forefront of Adult Swim, or what seems to be the norm at the doorstep of its content. Primal seeks out to nullify that, and it all needed to do was to go back to their roots, quite literally even, and tell a narrative of how a man, aptly named Spear, and his rival-first/semi-pet friend-later Tyrannosaurus Rex, also aptly named Fang, setting up their character without a coherent piece of exchange of dialogue between the two, unless you count constant gruntling, using their instincts to work together, overcoming challenges and it's beautiful. </b></i>

Primal is a visual masterclass on how ""show and tell"" is a more of a ingenious tactic from the creators of the forefather, primitive for the creation of Adult Swim later on, Gendy, besides his art-work, was creatively bounded by the suitable watchers of young children and early teens but always managed to pull of the darker strings in PowerPuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory, and unfortunately almost capped that off with the almost brilliant it set out to be in Sym-bionic Titan in his later parts of his career. Nevertheless, greenlighted to make a mature version of Samurai Jack, which by all-means is an all timer in it's own right, Gendy's true vision in storytelling unlocks at the helms of his latest project in Primal. While being creative in his designs, it's always a tougher challenge to make your art speak volumes, and ironically enough, the lack of dialogues amplifies how it achieves that, while concomitantly builds the tension it's rooted itself in the setting he chose. While yes, the ""focus-on-character, shock-face, reveal-dilemma"" might get a bit jaded and repetitive for the amounts of time they limit themselves, it does however create for a violent contention of World Building, which I believe would never be suitably built elsewhere except in the realm of Primal, that episode in, episode out has been subjected with consistent writing. Primarily built on 2 characters, there's always a case of how stagnant the show can get, with only a singular filler in a span of 20 episodes separating them, the layers on either of them hinders from them being just that and probably why the ""anthology-aspect and feel"" of the show helps that as well while being in the major compound focus of the theme, i-e, Survival.

3470,Masters Of The Air,"Drama, War & Politics",7.826,"Masters of the Air quickly becomes mired in its own cliched sentimentalism. 

Back slapping jokery characterisations are the norm. Airmen who are at the same time overconfident but somehow, inexplicably wise. Its unconvincing, as is the general sense of longing, for a rose coloured vision of a war time past, that never existed. 

Growing up I knew a man who fought in WWII and for a time had the unfortunate job of cleaning the bombers after a mission. What he told me about what was left in a plane after a bad mission was simply horrific. In fact, a lot worse than what we see depicted here. Although, in fairness, this series does at least make an effort to demonstrate, to a degree, the awfulness of war. 

That said, this series feels in most respects, more like a pitch for glory rather than the grisly, depressing reality of conflict and I, for one, find it rather inappropriate. Especially given the spread of very serious conflicts, in the world today.

On the upside the acting is of a high standard, if somewhat hamstrung by the at times cheesy, cliched characterisations and associated narrative. 

The real stand out in this series goes to its special effects, which can only be described as ""amazing"". A heck of a lot of money has been spent here and it really shows. 

In summary, if the treatment had been more down to earth, realistic and steered away from glorifying war, this series could have been been a more meaningful and compelling watch. As it stands, to this reviewer, it comes across as yet another pro military poster child. Something the current war torn world, could well do without.","Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle, Nate Mann, Stephen Campbell Moore","master air quickly become mire cliched sentimentalism . back slap jokery characterisations norm . airmen time overconfident somehow , inexplicably wise . unconvincing , general sense long , rise colour vision war time past , never exist . grow know man fight wwii time unfortunate job clean bombers mission . tell leave plane bad mission simply horrific . fact , lot worse see depict . although , fairness , series least make effort demonstrate , degree , awfulness war . say , series feel respect , like pitch glory rather grisly , depress reality conflict , one , find rather inappropriate . especially give spread serious conflict , world today . upside act high standard , somewhat hamstring time cheesy , cliched characterisations associate narrative . real stand series go special effect , describe `` amaze '' . heck lot money spend really show . summary , treatment earth , realistic steer away glorify war , series could meaningful compel watch . stand , reviewer , come across yet another pro military poster child . something current war tear world , could well without .",-1,-1
3470,Masters Of The Air,"Drama, War & Politics",7.826,"Was really hoping for a factually accurate representation of Air Combat in WW2, but what I was presented with (and in fairness I'm only 2 episodes in, so it might improve) is a massive bunch of revisionist, pro-American, anti-English/British nonsense that spends more time portraying squadrons, for want of a better word, ""fannying around"" than actually flying.

The performance of most of the actors is terrible, especially the two main characters. Austin Butler seems to have forgotten he's not playing Elvis anymore and has the same mannerisms and woeful underacting. This is only beaten by Callum Turner's hideous overacting. The only one that puts in a semi-noteworthy performance is Barry Keoghan. 

The plot then spends precisely zero time building the main characters up during training like Band of Brothers, or even their pre-military lives. As a result, I just have no emotional investment in any of them. I don't care about them. 

Also, the writers have fallen into the trap of creating the main characters like they seem to with a lot of modern characters. That is, they've been written to be overly cool, confident, super accomplished, ""Mary Sue's"" that can do no wrong and win at everything they do. The writers have created people that they _think_ the audience wants to see, but that just then makes them totally unrelatable. An example of this is where a fight starts in a pub with the British. The British pilot starts it, of course. The American pilots who, until this point, are portrayed as being overly confident, brash, and trying too hard to be cool, immediately switch personalites with the British who, until this point portrayed as, reserved, timid, and just in awe of the Americans in general. All of a sudden, the Americans become the ones that want to just mind their own business, are reserved and cool; while the portrayal of the RAF pilots are obnoxious, pompous, arrogant, and abrasive. Naturally, the American pilot utterly humiliates the British pilot by dancing all round him, making him fall over. The result is that the main characters are just thoroughly unlikeable and boring that you have absolutely no emotional investment in them. The absolute opposite of Dick Winters et al from the peerless Band of Brothers. 

It also leaves a bitter taste in the mouth as the British are portrayed as bigger villains that actual enemy is. 

Furthermore, the justification given for American bombing happening during the day was because they wanted to be more accurate at the expense of more risk - a challenge all the pilots faced with swagger, arrogance, and bravado, and because they are so much braver and heroic than the RAF wimps who just carpet bomb cities without a care in the world. 

But back to reality, this was predominantly down to overconfidence and hubris of the US leadership and because they refused to learn lessons identified by the RAF and Luftwaffe and that bombing during the day was counterproductive. Sure, you may be able to hit the target more on the first run, but by the end of it, you had so few bombers and crew left you couldn't reliably hit anything. The more bombers you lost, the more you were likely to lose, which then meant the less likely you were to complete a run at all, never mind bomb the target. 

This was proved correct when, on 22nd October 1943, the 8th Army stopped bombing it's unescorted daylight raids because they finally realised it was unsustainable. During this time, the USAAF, working with RAF Bomber Command, tried switching to night bombing, but found that the B-17s simply weren't capable and the crews not skilled enough to bomb with any amount of relevant precision. The ONLY reason day bombing could continue was due to the British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine being placed in the P51, along with the advent of drop tanks, meaning the P51 could escort bombers all the way to the target and back again.

Not only this, but the much vaunted (and boasted about in the show), Norden Bombsight, was nowhere near as accurate as it is believed. Under test conditions, it was great. Under combat conditions where aircraft had to zig zag to evade being hit by flak and flying over poor European weather conditions, meant that it was barely more accurate than the RAF's night bombing anyway! What this resulted in was many completely avoidable American deaths, but I bet they won't say that during this series. 

The best I can say is that the visuals are OK, but even they have been CGId to the extreme.

The missions themselves are boring and generally last 10 minutes, 15 minutes at the absolute most. Likely due to the fact that CGI has been used so heavily and the show couldn't afford more.

Sadly, what we've got here is a total misrepresentation of actual history, portrayed by a bunch of unlikeable characters simultaneously embodying the worst stereotypes of American soldiers and ""modern"" character development by writers that seem to have completely lost the ability to create a likeable character. They do all this in an overly CGId world, where most of the time the characters aren't doing anything remotely interesting or important and the 'combat' scenes last a grand total of 15 minutes.

3497,The Dangers In My Heart,"Animation, Comedy",8.5,"This show, ""**The Dangers in My Heart**,"" started out super awkward, like, way too cringey. But then, it turned into this super sweet story about two characters growing up. I actually liked it from the beginning, even with all the cringe, but by the end, it was one of my favorite shows of the season!

The main character, **Kyoutarou**, is basically the king of cringe. He's all edgy and creepy, even saying he wants to hurt his classmates (yikes!). I thought that would be the whole joke, but he actually turned out to be a good guy. He might act tough on the outside, but he's actually really good at noticing stuff and helping people, even though he's a little strange.

Each episode title has the word ""Karte"" in it, which is like a patient's medical file in Japanese. It's kind of like watching Kyoutarou slowly get better from his ""**chuunibyou**"" phase, which is basically just acting super dramatic. It's cool how they show this without just telling you. You see him slowly open up, talk to more people, and become braver. It's rare to see a character grow in such a natural way, especially in a romcom, which can be pretty predictable sometimes. Plus, it's cool that Kyoutarou is shorter than the girl he likes, something you don't see much in anime!

Then there's **Anna**, who seems perfect to everyone else. But guess what? She's kind of a goofball who does some crazy stuff that makes you wonder what she's thinking. At first, Kyoutarou puts her on a pedestal, but as they get closer, that pedestal shrinks, and even though she's taller, they feel closer.

The way the show is **Animated** is awesome too, The music is great too, by this famous composer who worked on other cool shows.

This whole show, from the awkwardness of young love to the sweet moments that made me feel all warm and fuzzy, is one of my favorite romcoms ever.

The little scenes where he talks to the camera really make a difference too his character as you see whats going on in his mind rather than just seeing the front he puts on to various other characters in the show.

3505,House Of Cards,Drama,8.02,"Wow! I have never stopped watching a series before this one. Even some of the paltry tripe like ""Dante's Cove"" or ""Game Of Thrones"" I managed to watch the series. But I watched the first season of this into Episode 10, where Frank kills Peter, and I just. Couldn't. Stand it. I ejected the blu-ray and have put up the series on Ebay for sale. I'll let someone else suffer.

NO ONE IS THIS MORALLY BANKRUPT AND EVIL (except for maybe Donald Trump). While we all would like to think that the deep, dark heart of politics is based on behaviour such as this, it is not reasonable that two people (Frank and Claire) would be able to manipulate EVERYBODY in their sphere to get what they want. Yes, there are naive people out there, but not everyone is cut from that cloth. This series (or at least what I could take of it) tries to make us believe that they are all cut from the same cloth, except for Frank and Claire. Stupid, just stupid.

To the creators of this show and to Netflix - you have to give the viewer a reason to watch this series, other than to dread every next move that the main characters make. There was no evidence at all that Frank and Claire were anything more than conniving, hateful people, because the writing and, especially, the direction gave us no more than that. And when the main characters are like that (written and directed very one-dimensionally), it makes it unwatchable because I, as the viewer, have no hope for any character in the show to develop in a positive manner or to react realistically to situations presented. Instead of killing Russo, Underwood could have been a human being and helped him into rehab, which would have effectively muzzled him anyway. But no - for dramatic effect, they had to have him killed. To what end? It made me as the viewer cringe and realize that the show was going to continue this way going forward, with no redemption for anyone in the show.

That being said, the performances were absolutely amazing, given the crappy material and direction that they were given. But good acting only goes so far. It *almost* seemed like Claire wanted to bust out when she was off coupling with her soulmate, but he turned out not to be that, as she suddenly reverted back to her mean and heartless ways.

I watch series for character development and to learn about human behaviour. I need a *hero* or at least a main character that has hope for growth and/or redemption. This series has neither. (Very much like Dexter years ago - why would I cheer or want to follow a serial killer?)

Don't waste your time with this. It'll leave you feeling dreadful and somewhat angry after each episode, without any payback for being put through that.","Robin Wright, Michael Kelly, Constance Zimmer, Patricia Clarkson, Derek Cecil","wow ! never stop watch series one . even paltry tripe like `` dante 's cove '' `` game throne '' manage watch series . watch first season episode 10 , frank kill peter , . could n't . stand . eject blu-ray put series ebay sale .

3507,Hawkeye,"Drama, Comedy, Action & Adventure",7.853,"Alright, Marvel fans, grab your bows because _Hawkeye_ on Disney+ is ready to serve up holiday vibes, action, and some seriously entertaining chemistry between Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld. If you’re expecting this show to blow open the multiverse or drop some mind-bending revelations, pump the brakes—this one’s a little different. It’s lighter, it’s fun, and it’s got just enough holiday spirit to keep you cozy during the season.

Clint Barton, the everyman Avenger, is just trying to make it home to his family for Christmas. Seems simple enough, but throw in Kate Bishop—a 22-year-old archer with hero aspirations—and things get complicated fast. She stumbles into trouble with the _Tracksuit Mafia_, a stolen Rolex, and Clint’s old Ronin suit, dragging him back into a world he thought he left behind. What follows is a buddy-cop style adventure through New York City with trick arrows, witty banter, and a surprising amount of heart.

When it comes to performances, Jeremy Renner effortlessly embodies Clint’s no-nonsense, world-weary demeanor. He’s been through the wringer, and you feel that weight in his portrayal. Hailee Steinfeld, on the other hand, shines as Kate Bishop. She brings a mix of charm, determination, and comedic timing that makes her instantly likable. Together, Renner and Steinfeld’s chemistry is the backbone of the show, keeping things engaging even when the plot feels scattered.

_Hawkeye_ doesn’t try to compete with the cosmic stakes of _Loki_ or the surreal mind games of _WandaVision_, and that’s part of its appeal. It’s more grounded, with a focus on character development and personal stakes rather than saving the universe. Clint’s internal struggle with his past as Ronin adds depth to his character, giving him a more human side that hasn’t been fully explored before.

While the show keeps the action tight and fun, it’s the guest appearances that really spice things up. Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova makes an electrifying return, Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez adds a fierce new layer to the story, and Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin? A welcome surprise that raises the stakes in the final episodes. However, at times the show struggles to give all its characters enough room to breathe, and the pacing can feel a bit uneven.

But _Hawkeye_ knows how to hit those feel-good holiday notes, wrapping up its action with humor and warmth. Whether it’s Clint teaching Kate some trick arrow tricks or the hilarious rooftop fight with Christmas lights and Molotov cocktails, the show doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s the kind of fun, feel-good superhero content that fits perfectly with the holiday season.

In the end, _Hawkeye_ doesn’t aim to redefine the MCU, but it delivers exactly what it should—a fun, character-driven adventure with plenty of festive spirit. Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld are a winning duo, and with action, humor, and some heartwarming moments, this is a holiday treat worth unwrapping.

Final verdict: _Hawkeye_ hits the bullseye with its lighthearted action, charming performances, and holiday cheer. While it may not shake up the MCU, it’s the perfect superhero comfort food for the season.","Jeremy Renner, Hailee Steinfeld, Tony Dalton, Alaqua Cox, Fra Fee","alright , marvel fan , grab bow _hawkeye_ disney+ ready serve holiday vibes , action , seriously entertain chemistry jeremy renner hailee steinfeld . ’ expect show blow open multiverse drop mind-bending revelations , pump brakes—this one ’ little different . ’ lighter , ’ fun , ’ get enough holiday spirit keep cozy season . clint barton , everyman avenger , try make home family christmas . seem simple enough , throw kate bishop—a 22-year-old archer hero aspirations—and things get complicate fast . stumble trouble _tracksuit mafia_ , steal rolex , clint ’ old ronin suit , drag back world think leave behind . follow buddy-cop style adventure new york city trick arrows , witty banter , surprise amount heart . come performances , jeremy renner effortlessly embody clint ’ no-nonsense , world-weary demeanor . ’ wringer , feel weight portrayal . hailee steinfeld , hand , shin kate bishop . bring mix charm , determination , comedic time make instantly likable . together , renner steinfeld ’ chemistry backbone show , keep things engage even plot feel scatter . _hawkeye_ ’ try compete cosmic stake _loki_ surreal mind game _wandavision_ , ’ part appeal . ’ ground , focus character development personal stake rather save universe . clint ’ internal struggle past ronin add depth character , give human side ’ fully explore . show keep action tight fun , ’ guest appearances really spice things . florence pugh ’ yelena belova make electrify return , alaqua cox maya lopez add fierce new layer story , vincent ’ onofrio ’ kingpin ? welcome surprise raise stake final episodes . however , time show struggle give character enough room breathe , pace feel bite uneven . _hawkeye_ know hit feel-good holiday note , wrap action humor warmth . whether ’ clint teach kate trick arrow trick hilarious rooftop fight christmas light molotov cocktails , show ’ take seriously . ’ kind fun , feel-good superhero content fit perfectly holiday season . end , _hawkeye_ ’ aim redefine mcu , deliver exactly should—a fun , character-driven adventure plenty festive spirit . jeremy renner hailee steinfeld win duo , action , humor , heartwarming moments , holiday treat worth unwrap . final verdict : _hawkeye_ hit bullseye lighthearted action , charm performances , holiday cheer . may shake mcu , ’ perfect superhero comfort food season .",1,1

Not only that but it also shares the same problems Jewel in the Palace (2003) had had. You may refer to my comment there. In comparison, I would nudge this one slightly higher since it had a more raw feeling to it. The drama also had a modern remake back in 2013.

There were too many identical copy-pasted scenes and jokes, they don't take any creative freedom with the core story/scenes to make the remake worthwhile.

The music, unfortunately, did not make an impact. There were scenes where a powerful music fits but instead it did not have any or a weaker music was used. They should've used more.

**IV. Production**
The production was very good. They spent for quality materials and designs for the wardrobe of the actors. This is specially true for IU where she was able to wear historical wardrobes yet with a modern touch which fits her aura. Great job in blending the two eras.

However, close-up shots were overused to the 5th power. It wasn't needed in many of the scenes, it became annoying. In the boat scenes, there was too much backlight glare from the sun the actors (again close-up shots) can be barely seen.","IU, Lee Joon-gi, Kang Ha-neul, Hong Jong-hyun, Baekhyun","_ * * 花より男子 ( hana yori dango ) ; meteor garden show political sibling rivalry * * _ * * i. story * * story many important character , important tell clearly , well . political war brothers interest , also pick good period korean version chinese novel . sadly , romantic aspect story deliver poorly . elicit emotional reaction . built-up . primarily story sibling rivalry go political level . * * ii . act * * lack areas , also scenes look like practice . also memorable scenes , pure laughter serious act natural . * * iii . music * * music , unfortunately , make impact . scenes powerful music fit instead weaker music use .

3532,Scarlet Heart: Ryeo,"Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, War & Politics",8.52,"This drama turned out to be a reverse harem in disguise. A handful of princes with varied flavors happened to meet a mentally handicapped girl to start their quest of hunting this wild female from a different timeline. All of these princes have the edgiest troubled teens behaviors with a mix of daddy/mommy issues. Out of all of them, the male lead took the edge in being the ultimate dark and mysterious bad boy, literally. Zooming out, all of this was done for a trail of pathetic emotional baits with no substance, they were begging the viewers for pity points. The moment the female lead knew about them, she approached every single one with the mentality of ""I can fix him"". While the princes were intentionally irrecoverably broken by the writer to serve a purpose for the female lead, she equally had her own set of problems. Within the span of a few episodes she became weirdly too attached to all of them and going even further to offer sacrifices, while neglecting her brief arrival and the fact that she was transferred to the past, but I guess shirtless bois are irresistible. The romantic entanglements in general were agonizing to tolerate, it kept you wishing the worse for all of them. Although it was bad as is, but why did they decide to make it worse with each passing episode in the second half? It's just too painful knowing the writer is making fun of us.

3555,The Falcon And The Winter Soldier,"Action & Adventure, Drama",7.6,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/tv-reviews/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-spoiler-free-review

""The Falcon and The Winter Soldier is definitely a less enthusiastic, slower, more grounded series than its magical predecessor, but it accomplishes the main mission of bringing the audience closer to Sam and Bucky. The character-driven show features exceptional dialogues and terrific performances from its leads, but the supporting cast steals the spotlight on several occasions, especially Daniel Brühl. The ""Black Captain America"" narrative and the subplot involving John Walker and a deep exploration of Cap's mantle are undoubtedly the most compelling, well-developed arcs of the whole series, though I appreciated every second spent with Sam dealing with his family issues and Bucky with his amends. However, the Morgenthau-led Flag Smashers fail to become more than just misunderstood, annoying antagonists, while Sharon Carter just feels like a completely out-of-place, unnecessary marketing strategy. Kari Skogland tries to keep every episode at a high level of quality, ultimately struggling with pacing issues and balance of storylines. In the end, she succeeds in leaving the viewers more emotionally attached to the (new) main heroes.""

3555,The Falcon And The Winter Soldier,"Action & Adventure, Drama",7.6,"_The Falcon and The Winter Soldier_ hits different. It’s gritty, it’s raw, and honestly, it gets closer to the edge of what we’ve been craving from Marvel—a deeper dive into what it _really_ means to be a hero. This isn’t just Sam and Bucky throwing punches and cracking jokes, though there’s plenty of that. It’s about the weight of the shield, the burden of legacy, and who truly deserves to carry the mantle of Captain America.

Let’s start with the obvious—Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are magic together. Their chemistry isn’t just solid, it’s _the_ foundation of this show. Whether they’re snarking at each other or working through their trauma, they bring so much heart and depth to their roles. It’s their dynamic that keeps the story grounded even when the action kicks into high gear. Seriously, without their banter and emotional beats, this show wouldn’t hit the same way.

And speaking of action, once this show finds its footing, it _soars_. Yes, it starts off a little slow, but once we’re knee-deep in the espionage and global stakes, it’s game on. We’re talking full-blown action sequences that rival the movies. But what I love is that it doesn’t just rely on spectacle. The fight scenes matter because of what’s going on beneath the surface—moral gray areas, power dynamics, and the pressure that comes with being more than just a man behind a shield.

What really makes _The Falcon and The Winter Soldier_ stand out is how it tackles some seriously tough issues. This isn’t just a superhero show; it’s a story about race, identity, and what it means to be a symbol in America. The way they explore Sam’s hesitation to take on the Captain America title is _bold_. Isaiah Bradley’s backstory? Heartbreaking and brutal, but so important. These moments make you pause and reflect, which is rare for a Marvel property, but man, it’s powerful.

Now, we have to talk about John Walker. Wyatt Russell as the new Captain America? Oof. The guy just exudes discomfort and frustration, and that’s the point. He’s not Steve Rogers, and the show makes sure you feel that tension. Walker’s descent, especially after that brutal shield moment, is intense, and it raises a lot of uncomfortable questions about power and morality.

This series digs deep into the consequences of being a hero, but it doesn’t lose sight of the fun. It’s still packed with those moments that make you cheer, laugh, or get a little choked up (yeah, I said it). It’s got heart and humor, and that classic Marvel spirit is still there—just with a lot more grit and real-world weight.

Sure, the pacing’s not perfect, but when the pieces come together, it’s worth the wait. And let’s not forget that this is setting up _so much more_. The Power Broker reveal, the global implications of super-soldiers, and, of course, Sam officially taking up the shield—it’s all priming us for the next phase of the MCU.

Bottom line: _The Falcon and The Winter Soldier_ doesn’t play it safe. It’s got layers, it’s got heart, and it’s not afraid to tackle the tough stuff. And by the time Sam steps into the Captain America suit? You’re all in. This is Marvel storytelling at its finest, and if you’re not onboard yet, you’re missing out.","Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Erin Kellyman, Daniel Brühl","_the falcon winter soldier_ hit different . ’ gritty , ’ raw , honestly , get closer edge ’ crave marvel—a deeper dive _really_ mean hero . ’ sam bucky throw punch crack joke , though ’ plenty . ’ weight shield , burden legacy , truly deserve carry mantle captain america . let ’ start obvious—anthony mackie sebastian stan magic together . chemistry ’ solid , ’ _the_ foundation show . whether ’ snarking work trauma , bring much heart depth roles . ’ dynamic keep story ground even action kick high gear . seriously , without banter emotional beat , show ’ hit way . speak action , show find foot , _soars_ . yes , start little slow , ’ knee-deep espionage global stake , ’ game . ’ talk full-blown action sequence rival movies . love ’ rely spectacle . fight scenes matter ’ go beneath surface—moral gray areas , power dynamics , pressure come man behind shield . really make _the falcon winter soldier_ stand tackle seriously tough issue . ’ superhero show ; ’ story race , identity , mean symbol america . way explore sam ’ hesitation take captain america title _bold_ . isaiah bradley ’ backstory ? heartbreaking brutal , important . moments make pause reflect , rare marvel property , man , ’ powerful . , talk john walker . wyatt russell new captain america ? oof . guy exude discomfort frustration , ’ point . ’ steve rogers , show make sure feel tension . walker ’ descent , especially brutal shield moment , intense , raise lot uncomfortable question power morality . series dig deep consequences hero , ’ lose sight fun . ’ still pack moments make cheer , laugh , get little choke ( yeah , say ) . ’ get heart humor , classic marvel spirit still there—just lot grit real-world weight . sure , pace ’ perfect , piece come together , ’ worth wait . let ’ forget set _so much more_ . power broker reveal , global implications super-soldiers , , course , sam officially take shield—it ’ prim us next phase mcu . bottom line : _the falcon winter soldier_ ’ play safe . ’ get layer , ’ get heart , ’ afraid tackle tough stuff . time sam step captain america suit ? ’ . marvel storytelling finest , ’ onboard yet , ’ miss .",1,1

It was interesting to watch them jump the shark in the final season, but the quality of the show suffered in places because of it. Some of the subplots became very silly and unrealistic, and their “This is Us” forays into the past and future seemed derivative and contrived. Susie and Mrs. Maisel seemed to be drawn larger than life and almost above the fray, and the rest of the cast wasn’t quite strong enough to do the heavy lifting of moving the story along. I am not saying it caused me to dislike the show or stop watching, because it didn’t.

3613,The Wild Wild West,"Action & Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Western, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",7.6,"I was born after the show had been off the air for a few years, so of course I discovered it in reruns. 

It was syndicated all over the country by then, and locally it aired on Sunday nights at 6pm (a fairly wise strategy, since airing episodes once a week meant they wouldn't run through them too quickly).

My father was a fan of the show, and we watched it together every Sunday evening after dinner. When we started this ritual I was too young to enjoy most of the shows my dad enjoyed, but this had everything I could want; good guys, bad guys, lots of action, inventive plots, gadgets, and humor.  

It might be the only show that I enjoyed at that age that I still enjoy today because of its quality. (I can still watch Happy Days or the Dukes of Hazzard and remember WHY I enjoyed them at that age, but they don't hold up).

The writers were inventive, and the show was able to mix sci-fi with the western genre very well, with some really nice gothic horror touches and mystery elements along the way. 

Robert Conrad deserves praise for his stunt work, which was a hallmark of the show, along with Ross Martin and his many disguises and accents.  

Probably the best part of the show was the villain each week, sometimes bent on world domination, but always creative. 

The show spawned two reunion movies, which failed to recapture the spirit of the original series but were both pleasant diversions for a few hours. Unfortunately the show was unable to escape the 'old tv show turned into a big screen movie' machine in Hollywood, and the results were a mess.","Robert Conrad, Ross Martin","bear show air years , course discover rerun . syndicate country , locally air sunday nights 6pm ( fairly wise strategy , since air episodes week mean would n't run quickly ) . father fan show , watch together every sunday even dinner . start ritual young enjoy show dad enjoy , everything could want ; good guy , bad guy , lot action , inventive plot , gadgets , humor . might show enjoy age still enjoy today quality .

I like my animation viewing to be chock full of bouncy female parts, female curves, awesome special affects and better combat.

This anime,**Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!** (_Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!_), didn't come up on my radar until the a-hole liberal Leftists in social media from the U.S. tried to negatively criticize the use of the Uzaki-chan character's physical features; her boobs.  That is all they, in their biased cynical view, could see.  The character was being used to inspire the male populous to donate blood.  But that didn't seem to matter to limited tyrannical view of SJW feminists left.  I was estactic beyond words when the country decided to ignore social media tripe, and keep the image up as a promotional.

After that situation passed, I went to a known site for featuring animation and gave the character and series a look-see.  And after seeing the first few episodes, I knew those jerks on social media (they have a blue bird for a symbol), who were complaining about the character, had no idea the level of benignity the Uzaki-chan character possessed. To my surprise the show hooked me.  I liked everything about the show.  I liked how Uzaki-chan was outgoing.  I liked how she got on the male protagonist's nerves with her out-of-the-social norm behavior.  I like the situationals Uzaki's behavior gets them into; especially when they embarrass Sakurai.  I liked both the male and female leads' friends, and how they were trying to get Uzaki and Sakurai together as a couple.  I liked how the two leads have a hard time admitting they liked each other, and how hard they fight (futilely) to keep from admitting it.  Most of all, I LOVE how there isn't an ounce of SJW, feminism, or >eghk< critical race theory in any of it.  **SUCH a relief**.  It's just entertainment; and _it is SOOOOO refreshing_.  >nearly in tears<

3684,Warrior,"Crime, Drama, Action & Adventure, Western",7.966,"The marketing point for this series is that this work is ""based on the writings of Bruce Lee.""  Well it certainly does indeed; the storylines and ideologies are from that of the 1970's, which are so out of touch with the 21st century audience.

There's nothing special or memorable here with just a slight homage to his classic steps and moves--again more stuff from the 70's.  Watch 'Into the Badlands' instead... their producers learned after the first season, much more artistic, dynamic and grandiose in the second season.

In this day and age when the n-word is sensitively removed from the lexicons in entertainment, media and society, then why is it still OK to repeatedly use the c-word which is equally vile, hurtful and offensive?  Just teaching and perpetuating another generation of viewers that it is OK to continue to be hateful and insulting.  This also just shows the lacking of creativeness and skillfulness in the writers' and directors' storytelling abilities--shame on them for being tone-deaf and taking the easy route.

3684,Warrior,"Crime, Drama, Action & Adventure, Western",7.966,"I would like to be able to say I'm glad to see Warrior back on the screen for a third season but, well, I'm not. Here's why.

It was my understanding that this series was finished with season two. Season two rounded out the tale of a clash between rival Tongs in the early days of San Francisco, nicely.

The third season effectively starts without any meaningful purpose and direction and it really shows.The struggle between the Tong's is resurrected, leaving a stale feeling of deja vu. A new character or two is dropped in, along with a sprinkling of sub plots in an attempt to liven things up. That said, its not really contributing anything compelling to a tale well told. 

Adding not only to the sense of inertia but also irritation is the need to tout, the by now hoary chestnut, that is ""the message"". Alternate lifestyles, diversity and feminism are front and centre. Out of place revisionism, in a tale that's supposed to be set over 100 years ago, filled with gritty, martial arts, action.

It's almost hard to believe, but it has been nearly 20 years since _Band of Brothers_ was released on HBO. _Band of Brothers_ is one of those rare examples of near perfection in a television series. In fact it to me this is not really a TV series, it's more like an incredible ten hour movie.

Based on a book of the same name written by Stephen Ambrose, this follows the real life exploits of the men of E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne. We go from their formation and training to their jump into Normandy on D-Day and stay with them right through to Germany's surrender. Over the course of ten episodes we get to know several members of the Company, and experience the horrors and brotherhood of war all the way through.

Apart from the movie level budget, cinematography, visual and make up effects, what makes it so good is that it’s not just a birds eye view of each step of their journey. In each episode we get that wider view but we also get to spend some time with a member of the Company. Whether it’s Bull getting stranded in an occupied village, Doc Roe scrounging for medical supplies in Bastogne, or Lipton narrating an entire episode, each episode brings some sort of variety from the one previous. Likewise not every episode is full of combat, across all of it there is a good balance of personal moments, tension, and all out combat action. Each of those three aspects are skilfully executed too, so the show never gets boring, there aren't any lulls.

I recently watched the movie _Midway_ and in my review of it I said that part of its downfall was trying to do too much by jamming seven months of war into two hours. _Band of Brothers_ is the perfect example of what can be done when there is more time to tell the story. It never feels rushed, it's paced perfectly and its pretty easy to keep track of who's who all the way through.

Speaking of ""who's who"" this has so many “OMG it’s that guy” moments. Given that this was made 20 years ago there are a whole bunch of now-established actors making early forays into their careers, or whom you recognise now for completely different work. Of course there's Damien Lewis and Ron Livingstone front and center, but there's also Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, James McAvoy, David Schwimmer, Simon Pegg, Jimmy Fallon, Colin Hanks, Donnie Wahlberg, and Michael Cudlitz. There are of course many more, and each episode I found myself looking up online to see if that person I spotted was the person I thought it was.

I could go on and on and on about this show. I absolutely love it, it's a masterpiece and may well be my favourite mini-series of all time. Even now, 20 years later this remains a stunning achievement in television history and it is, in my opinion, must see TV.","Damian Lewis, Donnie Wahlberg, David Schwimmer, Eion Bailey, Ron Livingston","click video version review : https : //youtu.be/fo2dgmc97q8 's almost hard believe , nearly 20 years since _band brothers_ release hbo . _band brothers_ one rare examples near perfection television series . fact really tv series , 's like incredible ten hour movie . base book name write stephen ambrose , follow real life exploit men e company , 506th regiment , 101st airborne . go formation train jump normandy d-day stay right germany 's surrender . course ten episodes get know several members company , experience horrors brotherhood war way . apart movie level budget , cinematography , visual make effect , make good ’ bird eye view step journey . episode get wider view also get spend time member company . whether ’ bull get strand occupy village , doc roe scrounge medical supply bastogne , lipton narrate entire episode , episode bring sort variety one previous . likewise every episode full combat , across good balance personal moments , tension , combat action . three aspects skilfully execute , show never get bore , n't lull . recently watch movie _midway_ review say part downfall try much jam seven months war two hours . _band brothers_ perfect example do time tell story . never feel rush , 's pace perfectly pretty easy keep track 's way . speak `` 's '' many “ omg ’ guy ” moments . give make 20 years ago whole bunch now-established actors make early foray career , recognise completely different work . course 's damien lewis ron livingstone front center , 's also michael fassbender , tom hardy , jam mcavoy , david schwimmer , simon pegg , jimmy fallon , colin hanks , donnie wahlberg , michael cudlitz . course many , episode find look online see person spot person think . could go show . absolutely love , 's masterpiece may well favourite mini-series time . even , 20 years later remain stun achievement television history , opinion , must see tv .",1,1

It spans the training period that commenced in 1942 and culminated in the American triumph in World War II. What struck me profoundly was the cinematography, particularly the exquisite quality of the visuals, which allows viewers to experience the intense emotions of soldiers bracing for the next engagement. It brings you amidst the battlefield, with adrenaline and fear coursing through their and your veins. The music and sound effects are so immersive that they evoke a palpable sense of anxiety about the possibility of being shot. The Band of Brothers made significant sacrifices to forge a better world, and although they succeeded in their mission, our generation has likely fallen short in honoring their legacy. The narrative includes minimal references to the political landscape, leaving the viewer uncertain about the moral standings of the opposing sides. However, the primary focus remains on the lives of these heroes and the grim realities of war. It is conceivable that Germans and Americans could have formed lasting friendships absent the influence of their politicians. It is imperative that we do not allow our governments to stray from their intended purposes; it is our responsibility to safeguard our freedom and democracy. It's a must-watch that serves as a poignant reminder that the ""freedom"" we enjoy today was purchased at the cost of countless lives lost due to the folly of political leaders.

It isn't a series for everyone when you consider this, and that Isaac Asimov isn't just an advanced sci-fi writer but also a visionary almost one century before us. It is a case of love or hate especially when it involves two types of media, a filmed streaming series (with no easy task at hand) and a series of written books (with more two sequels and two prequels in a total of 7 books).

Do not attach to most of the characters as many of them obviously won't live the 1000+ span of years of the saga of the original trilogy.

The books are just magical, complex and transcending - if you like the series go read them. There are many differences of course but to go into full fidelity runs into that case of a ""book that is impossible to make a film"".

The actors are top notch into their roles and the budget that Apple spent on this one is comparable to a big budget movie (around 70M a episode), with effects on CGI and sound that should be viewed in IMAX.

What makes a good makjang is having a reasonable push and pull balance for its conflicts, however, this drama tipped the scale all the way to the other side. The result is having an utterly doormat female lead which led to a miserable experience for the viewers. Throughout its runtime, everyone was pushing her around with all kinds of abuse, but there was never a real push back. Waiting in desperation to see her bite back but the drama didn't allow it. The attempt to show her standing up for herself resulted in a successful failure, as expected. There were other problems relating to balance all over the drama. The ending as well followed the same pattern, denying the viewers a reasonable amount of satisfaction after all the preceding events. God bless the ML's aunt, Jung Eun suk, for keeping the drama tolerable and watchable.

The characters transformation and development marred the story with crazy inconsistencies and illogical character arcs for the sake of forced progression. Everything went downhill after episode 4, it relied on these outlandish situations that made it way too hard to remain invested.

These first 4 episodes were painful to sit through, unbelievably boring, lacking any interesting or gripping elements and it failed to lay the groundwork for things to look forward to in the future episodes.

Although the male lead was labeled as a genius and has super powers but his character proved to be otherwise. Namkoong Min playing a pathetic low-life chaebol playboy villain was definitely a miscast. It would more suitable for him to play a smart cunning merciless villain but the director was blind.

3864,Welcome To Waikiki,"Drama, Comedy",7.7,"Season 1
The drama did a great job in blending humor and heart, creating an enjoyable mix with a lively dynamic, for the most part. The comedy was sharp and varied, ranging from slapstick to witty banter, however, this didn't apply for every segment and joke. Some of these went on for too long or weren't interesting in the slightest, these were also more present in the 2nd half than the first one. Nonetheless, not only the drama had great humor but also had a progressing story that fit right in. The dynamic chemistry among the cast enhanced the comedic timing, while the well-paced storyline balanced these moments with memorable scenes. Speaking of dynamics, Doo Shik remained a sidekick and a third wheel in every situation and scene, he was never a lead and always the weakest link, even the actor himself. The drama should've wrote him better to fit the dynamic rather than having a wasted slot. Anyway, it's an enjoyable fun watch for what it had to offer. However, I highly advise against watching season 2.

Season 2
In comparison, season 2 was a complete utter failure in all regards, however, as a stand alone drama, it was a passable cheap inoffensive forgettable watch, for the most part. It failed miserably to capture the same magic that made the first season so endearing. The second season felt like a pale imitation, struggling to find its footing. One major issue was the lack of continuity in the cast, with many beloved characters and dynamics from the first season absent with no worthy replacements. This shift disrupted the chemistry and dynamic that were crucial to the show's initial charm. The new characters, while sometimes amusing, didn't bring the same level of depth, humor and relatability, resulting in a series of forced and often flat comedic moments. Speaking of comedy, the writing in season 2 leaned heavily on repetitive gags and clichéd scenarios, lacking the creativity and originality that kept the first season fresh and engaging. Not to mention its poor job in recycling some of the gags and scenarios, as well as most of the romances and its archetypes from season 1. Seriously shameful! The brief storylines were disjointed, and the emotional moments that once balanced the humor now came across as contrived and artificial. The romantic relationships, while they never were the main focus, were really stupid and tasteless. The pacing also suffered, with episodes dragging without the slightest engaging interplay of humor and character moments that previously defined the show. Second season tried to replicate the success of its predecessor but fell quite short, the charm, wit, and warmth that made the first season a hit were noticeably missing. I highly advise watching S1 and ignoring S2.

3880,Doctor Who,"Drama, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",7.9,"How do you review a show like Doctor Who that has been running for so long, enjoying dizzying highs and terrible lows (I'm looking at you The Twin Dilemma).

The concept is the most open there can be. With the TARDIS the show can go anywhere and any when. This lead to a huge range in the stories, from historical with no alien involvement like The Aztecs (1964), to full on sci-fi like The Daleks (1963) and that was just the first series.

The show created some of the most memorable monsters with the Daleks and Cybermen being the most famous. Even outside the recurring creatures there were fantastic adversaries like an Egyptian god bent on destruction to an alien splintered through time.

Doctor Who also embraced change in the form of the regeneration. The actor playing the Doctor could change and play the part differently but it still was the Doctor. This led to changes in approach to problems and in the attitude of the central character while keeping core values the same.
The Doctor is one of the few heroes who rarely resorts to violence to solve problems, usually relying on his intelligence and wits.

The show also truly innovated. Many special effects were tried out for the first time on screen. It didn't always work but working with what they had they created some truly memorable television like creating a convincing lunar surface 2 years before the moon landings (The Moonbase 1967).

That said, Revenge of Others is quite accessible, to a range of viewers. 
Thankfully, it doesn't play heavily on the teenie aspect of the drama. Instead, this is essentially a crime thriller, with a social commentary, about rich vs poor. 

The story can get a little convoluted at times, you have to pay attention to the plot twists and turns. If you do, it does reward the viewer with an intriguing tale of revenge and murder.

Acting is excellent and chemistry/rivalry between key protagonists, is convincing.

3885,Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles,"Animation, Drama, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.3,"I’d like to believe that I’ve watched quite a lot of titles since I started my anime journey back in 2017. The problem or advantage with this is that you can easily recognise patterns in shows, you can easily tell which direction the show is going to take. And for most shows, you can just tell how generic they are going to be from a  mile away.
Although this one hasn’t introduced guilds or adventuring storylines (I’m still on episode 3, about to start episode 4), it follows the same plot lines of ‘I have too much power, but I can’t be arsed so I need to hide’. They tried to hard to downplay the main characters accomplishments any time he did something.

It kind of gets boring at this point because you can never feel happy for him. And despite everyone everyone else watching him grow for 5 years I think, they still doubt him. They never change their outlook on him. Even when he’s being bullied, no one really looks out for him and they just look away.

In the battle against that huge monster when he had saved the little princess, no one cared that he had sacrificed himself for the princess. Despite she trying to get them to acknowledge that he did something nice. They even end up pinning it on him feeling guilty about making him fall in the first place, when everyone knew he was nowhere near her in the first place.

They tried really hard to make sure him defeating the huge monster would go uncredited, how could they not hear or lose track of a monster you’re running away from that has such a presence. And they only show up when the battle is over, because we can’t have any witnesses witnessing the main character taking out a monster nobody could handle. No one is going to question why it’s suddenly quiet when a minute ago you were running for your lives... all in the bid to just have the plot progress in the direction of the main character being exiled and taking the blame for what was the commanding officers directions. 


Anyway watch it if you want a generic show that you’ll be able to guess what the next move is going to be, which I presume from what the previews of episode 4 shows, is going to be assembling our harem because what’s an isekai with a harem.","Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Ayaka Suwa, Akane Fujita, Yuuki Kuwahara","’ like believe ’ watch quite lot title since start anime journey back 2017. problem advantage easily recognise pattern show , easily tell direction show go take . show , tell generic go mile away . although one ’ introduce guilds adventure storylines ( ’ still episode 3 , start episode 4 ) , follow plot line ‘ much power , ’ arsed need hide ’ . try hard downplay main character accomplishments time something . kind get bore point never feel happy . despite everyone everyone else watch grow 5 years think , still doubt . never change outlook . even ’ bully , one really look look away . battle huge monster save little princess , one care sacrifice princess . despite try get acknowledge something nice . even end pin feel guilty make fall first place , everyone know nowhere near first place . try really hard make sure defeat huge monster would go uncredited , could hear lose track monster ’ run away presence . show battle , ’ witness witness main character take monster nobody could handle . one go question ’ suddenly quiet minute ago run live ... bid plot progress direction main character exile take blame command officer directions . anyway watch want generic show ’ able guess next move go , presume preview episode 4 show , go assemble harem ’ isekai harem .",-1,0
3888,The King: Eternal Monarch,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",8.298,"**_The Greatest Science Fiction Romance in the last 40 years_**

""더 킹: 영원의 군주"" or ""The King: Eternal Monarch"" (2020) was the best science fiction and romance of the 2010 decade. I would say that this show has gained the number one (#1) spot in my list of ""Top 10 Overall Best Sci-fi TV Show"" pushing down ""Fringe"" (2008) which held that rank for 12 years.

**I. Story**
The writer, Kim Eun Sook of the ""Lovers in Paris"" (2004); ""Descendants of the Sun"" (2016); ""Goblin"" (2016); and ""Mr. Sunshine"" (2018) fame, once again showed us her amazing talent in creating stories that truly captures the imagination and heart of the audience.

In ""The King: Eternal Monarch"" (2020), Kim Eun Sook has woven beautifully the ""parallel world"" trope into her memorable romance plots. She did not leave it simply as a literary device then forgotten, she placed it in the center of the series, and the drama and romance unfolded through it.

Each episode was more or less one hour and ten minutes, and no episode was boring, no episode was dragging, no episode was a repeat of previous ones. In every episode there is a fresh plot, a new story to tell which added to the development of the characters, the relationships between them, and the tension and clashes when worlds and ambitions collide.

**II. Acting/Cast**
What an amazing cast--Lee Min Ho, Kim Go Eun, Woo Do Hwan, Kim Kyung Nam, Jung Eun CHae, Lee Jung Jin, Kim Yong Ji, Kang Hong Suk--they picked the right people for the roles. Their unique acting styles made their characters fully alive and their interaction with each other natural.

The show was not only about ""Yi Gon"" (Lee Min Ho) and ""Jeong Tae Eul"" (Kim Go Eun), everyone were key persons in creating the world of the ""Kingdom of Corea"". They all brought their best and created a masterpiece.

**III. Production**
While there were a few noticeable errors, the editing and sequence of the scenes covered it all. I especially like how they did not present the stories, in each episode, in a linear fashion; instead they kept scenes for the next episodes and did flashbacks at the right time.

The mixing of historical with the modern in the fictional ""Kingdom of Corea"" were seamless. There were no out-of-place moments. Where there are modern things, the room was designed to fit these modern gadgets. Where there should be a historical look and feel, the room either did not have any modern materials or the few blended with the environment. Not an easy task to achieve.

It was not only the interior designers but it was also the directors and cameramen who did great shots in creating a seamless mix of historical and the modern environments.

**IV. Conclusion**
I highly recommend ""더 킹: 영원의 군주"" or ""The King: Eternal Monarch"" (2020) especially if one is a fan of ""parallel world"" type of science fiction. Think of this show as ""Fringe"" (2008) but with touchy romance and intense family rivalry.

3905,The Man In The High Castle,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.5,"# One of the best TV dramas in recent memory
<b>First, a disclaimer:</b> I've not read Dicks' original version of <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>, nor do I intend to read it. I am judging the show entirely on its own merits, without any influence or critiquing related to the novel.

## On to the review!

I'm going to keep this short and simple, so you don't have to read a shit-ton of stuff and so that I don't write any spoilers. Here's what you need to know:

As a sci-fi story, <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> falls a bit short. The showrunners tried to wrap up the sci-fi bit at the end, but they did a pretty piss-poor job. Budget cuts? Rushed delivery? Who knows? Fortunately, the sci-fi aspect of this story isn't actually what makes it great.

What makes <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> great storytelling and great television is the alt-history and the in-depth character story arcs; in particular, the story of the Smiths—the highest-ranking family in the Nazis' American Reich—is absolutely fantastic. In John and Helen Smith, we get to explore what it might have meant for regular Americans to throw their lots in with the Nazi Party had the Axis powers won WWII. Through dialogue and flashbacks, we get to see how joining the Nazi Party twisted both John and Helen into persons unrecognizable from their alt-world selves. Truly, the Smiths' story arc was easily my favorite, and it is the backbone of the show. You will never feel sorry for John or Helen, but you will understand them—and you will feel sorry for their children.

Add to this mix some solid intrigue and action, plus a strong, capable female protagonist, and you will see why <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> is really good television.

Also, don't let my initial talk of the sci-fi component scare you off. The showrunners may not have done a great job of resolving that part of the story, but the characters' stories were all resolved to my satisfaction. (Well, with one exception, but...it didn't ruin the show for me.)

I recommend this show highly to people who enjoy:

- Military fiction
- Historical fiction
- Alt-historical fiction
- [Light] sci-fi

3905,The Man In The High Castle,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.5,"So, the problem that we are facing with this is that the episodes exceed the story. It's the same problem that a LOT of television shows on streaming services suffer from. They have a few too many episodes for the story they are telling in the season.

About 8 episodes per season and about 5 episodes of actual story. The result is so much filler that it seems to drag and not really accomplish anything of value.

However, the story is interesting, as is the world that it is set in. Unlike A Handmaiden's Tale, or really, a lot of other shows, it doesn't feel like you are being lectured to.

But it does feel like it dragged. All they needed to do was lesson the amount of episodes to fit the story, or add a subplot or two more and it would have been a killer show.

Instead, the result is a good show that has been stretched until it's paper thin

And then season 3 hit and what was good was replaced with woke messaging. And the lectures became nonstop.

3911,The Good Place,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Comedy",8.0,"The Good Place is a fantasy-comedy that was first broadcast on NBC in the Fall of 2016.  Unlike most TV comedies, it is serialized, with a continuing story that flows from one episode to the next.  It is filmed without a laugh track.

The show has six characters.  Two of them Janet and Michael (Ted Danson), operate a post-mortem world call the Good Place, and the other four, Eleanora (Kristin Bell), Chidi, Tahani, and Jason, are recently deceased humans who are bewildered to find themselves in the place. 

I find this a highly original show.  It deals with issues rarely seen in TV comedy: death and the afterlife, guilt and responsibility, but does so in highly amusing ways (One running joke is a spell that overrides swear words with innocuous ones like ""fork"" and ""shirt"", much to the irritation of characters who really feel a need to sound off).  It has a unusually diverse cast, three of the six main characters being Filipino, Asian-Indian, and Senegalese.  Since Chidi is a former philosophy professor, it also has an intellectual side as he tries to make sense of his new eternal dwelling place.  In contrast to the well-behaved ""Good Place"",  we have frequent farcical flashbacks to the characters' wild former lives, a la ""Lost"".

And that is pretty unsettling.

But aside from that, this is a tragedy. It was never a good show, Salute Your Shorts, from back in the day that at least had fun characters and actual laughs so much so that I even heard my jaded parents laugh at some of it.

But, BUNK'D never had that level of goodness.  It was always sort of... well, it always kind of stank.  It was one of the modern kids shows that assumed that all children are idiots.  that never makes for a good show, assuming your audience rides the short bus never works

And that is what it was... a bad show made for kids

But then they started doing the Woke check boxes and it became a racist show made for racist liberal white wine moms to watch when they are drunk at 9AM with their children while dad is at work.

At the heart, it was a show about a relationship, and one marred by the pitfalls of.... living with a super hero. That was a good pitch right there, that added something to the genre that you never really saw before, and Clark was excellent for the role.

But who cares, right, the how was all flash and style and it really needed to be. It was a police show that tried to epitomize everything that 80s pop culture thought was cool.

But then it came on when I was 4 and I remember watching the last two seasons live with my parents so there might be a nostalgia component to it. But even then, when people think of the 80s, they think of Miami Vice. That's how they picture they style, it's how they picture the music, and that goes straight to the logo.

The entire story's setup involving the kids was absurd even for a silly makjang. It quickly became apparent that the drama was attempting to do something different from other daily makjang but the execution was nothing but comical, even while adding hints of unintentional parody. I couldn't stand how the drama was structured with its storytelling, it was really tiring how every single key information had 3 layers of truths that kept throwing the blame onto 3 parties. It was really exhausting repeating the same pattern 30-40 times. There's a lot to be said while breaking down everything but I would be repeating myself so here are some random bits. I found it particularly cringe when characters called themselves and each others witches with nicknames, for example 'The White-Haired Witch'. Despite being the face of the drama, Yoo Kyung's lifelong revenge wasn't finalized due to some events which is disappointing. It felt like the male lead suddenly confessed his love with no proper build up or showing prior interest beyond some sympathy, it happened too early in the story even though he was a womanizer a couple of episodes ago. Moreover, the male lead was mostly useless and didn't play as big of a part as most of the other characters. Midway through he was just there wasting time while occasionally being an unfunny clown. I guess he was just there to give the female lead a hug every now and then. On the flip side, the other male lead, Ji Ho, was in every other scene more than any character in the drama. One last thing, the overall vibe and tone later on was very detached and different from the few first episodes (after the kids story setup). If I had to mention something positive other than the cinematography being up to the modern standard with the majority of projects, that would be how secrets don't linger for too long which is because of the aforementioned repeated pattern.","Jang Seo-hee, Oh Chang-seok, Kim Kyu-seon, Han Ji-Wan, Ban Hyo-jung","right first 8 minutes introduction fail .... , fail . entire story 's setup involve kid absurd even silly makjang . quickly become apparent drama attempt something different daily makjang execution nothing comical , even add hint unintentional parody . could n't stand drama structure storytelling , really tire every single key information 3 layer truths keep throw blame onto 3 party . really exhaust repeat pattern 30-40 time .

(Based on the season’s first three episodes handed to press)

Marvel delivered an unprecedentedly successful superhero universe that culminated in the record-breaking Avengers: Endgame (Spider-Man: Far from Home is actually the last movie of the Infinity Saga, but let’s ignore that). With the first overarching story ending after twenty-three films, the MCU now begins a new Era. Basically, Phase Four is truly another Phase One, where viewers will meet new heroes to root for. However, there are dozens of Avengers still in the game, including the astonishingly powerful Wanda. 

Television will play a massive role in the upcoming saga, with miniseries starring key superheroes having a significant impact in the movies. Obviously, this raises the question: do viewers need to watch the TV shows in order to understand and follow the films? I believe so. Some series might not have as much impact as others, but WandaVision will undoubtedly affect Wanda’s path in the MCU. From being one of the most powerful Avengers to the possibility of Wanda being the next big villain, this character has limitless potential. In addition to this, Elizabeth Olsen is arguably one of the best actresses in the franchise, and honestly, of her entire generation.

Therefore, even though I always try to keep my expectations as moderate as possible, I couldn’t help but feel extremely hyped for WandaVision. The series is as weird and mysterious as I expected it to be. In the first three episodes, the viewer is placed inside a black-and-white sitcom, where it becomes super clear that everything that’s happening is occurring inside Wanda’s own mind or something similar that she’s definitely responsible for. Having in mind what happened to Vision in his last movie, it seems that this series will heavily deal with sensitive matters, such as grief, depression, and unhealthy escapism. However, these first episodes are pretty much set in following the comedy route.

Boasting tons of references to the respective period of classic television, WandaVision is much more hilarious than I ever anticipated it to be. Several seemingly easy yet efficient jokes about Wanda and Vision’s powers and their nature are the ones that bring out the most generous laughter (impeccable writing from Jac Schaeffer). In this regard, I have to praise Kathryn Hahn (Agnes), whose performance as the “nosy neighbor” is wonderfully funny. Teyonah Parris doesn’t really interpret her real character yet (Monica Rambeau), but her display is rather interesting. The rest of the cast is pretty good, but it all comes down to Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, who are beautifully charming and amusing together.

Their chemistry is even more palpable now that they’re the protagonists of their own story. It’s a strange feeling watching Bettany portray Vision again, but his terrific performance comes to demonstrate that the viewer’s connection with the character is as humanly compelling as any other. However, Olsen is the real star of the show. I admit that I might be a bit biased since she is one of my favorite actresses working today, but Olsen proves why she’s worthy of bigger roles in Hollywood outside of the MCU. An unbelievable emotional range, excellent comedic timing, exquisite expressiveness, and an impressive capability of drastically and quickly changing styles. An Emmy nomination wouldn’t be surprising.

The main storyline revolves around Wanda’s apparently ideal life with Vision. How? That is the intriguing mystery, which exponentially receives more clues after each episode. A certain symbol points to an organization that will undoubtedly make Marvel fans scream with excitement, right from the very first episode (if you look closely, you’ll find it). This is the first MCU content since July 2019, so the stakes are inevitably high as Matt Shakman must fulfill the mission of bringing back the enthusiasm for the respective universe. Shakman and Schaeffer employ weirdness and unconventional storytelling that transform the series into an extremely captivating story, even though the main answer for what’s happening seems quite clear.

Technically, Christophe Beck’s score is the standout. From the timely sound effects of classic television to specific songs that play during certain moments, Beck delivers a score that elevates the overall show. The opening credits are unique and always different, referencing various Eras of television (shoutout to Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez for composing the theme music). As for the rest, terrific editing from Tim Roche, Nona Khodai, and Zene Baker. The visual effects look seamless even in black-and-white, and Jess Hall’s cinematography cleverly resembles sitcoms attributes. Outstanding production design (Mark Worthington) as well.

All in all, after only three episodes, WandaVision proves to be as weird, mysterious, and exceptionally captivating as it intends to be. Matt Shakman and Jac Schaeffer deliver a surprisingly hilarious show with just the right amount of hints to what’s truly happening. Even though the global answer seems rather predictable, creative storytelling builds an atmosphere of uncertainty and puzzling doubts that will leave viewers craving for the next episode. From the gorgeous black-and-white to Christophe Beck’s brilliant score, Wanda and Vision’s apparently ideal life is surrounded by technical attributes that pay homage to the Era of classic television. Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, and Kathryn Hahn are all fantastic, but Elizabeth Olsen is the indisputable star, showing her undeniable acting talent that might very well earn her an Emmy nod.

Original Review
(based on the season’s first three episodes handed to press)

Marvel delivered an unprecedentedly successful superhero universe that culminated in the record-breaking Avengers: Endgame (Spider-Man: Far from Home is actually the last movie of the Infinity Saga, but let’s ignore that). With the first overarching story ending after twenty-three films, the MCU now begins a new Era. Basically, Phase Four is truly another Phase One, where viewers will meet new heroes to root for. However, there are dozens of Avengers still in the game, including the astonishingly powerful Wanda. 

Television will play a massive role in the upcoming saga, with miniseries starring key superheroes having a significant impact in the movies. Obviously, this raises the question: do viewers need to watch the TV shows in order to understand and follow the films? I believe so. Some series might not have as much impact as others, but WandaVision will undoubtedly affect Wanda’s path in the MCU. From being one of the most powerful Avengers to the possibility of Wanda being the next big villain, this character has limitless potential. In addition to this, Elizabeth Olsen is arguably one of the best actresses in the franchise, and honestly, of her entire generation.

Therefore, even though I always try to keep my expectations as moderate as possible, I couldn’t help but feel extremely hyped for WandaVision. The series is as weird and mysterious as I expected it to be. In the first three episodes, the viewer is placed inside a black-and-white sitcom, where it becomes super clear that everything that’s happening is occurring inside Wanda’s own reality or something similar that she’s definitely responsible for. Having in mind what happened to Vision in his last movie, it seems that this series will heavily deal with sensitive matters, such as grief, depression, and unhealthy escapism. However, these first episodes are pretty much set in following the comedy route.

Boasting tons of references to the respective period of classic television, WandaVision is much more hilarious than I ever anticipated it to be. Several seemingly easy yet efficient jokes about Wanda and Vision’s powers and their nature are the ones that bring out the most generous laughter (impeccable writing from Jac Schaeffer). In this regard, I have to praise Kathryn Hahn (Agnes), whose performance as the “nosy neighbor” is wonderfully funny. Teyonah Parris doesn’t really interpret her real character yet (Monica Rambeau), but her display is rather interesting. The rest of the cast is pretty good, but it all comes down to Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, who are beautifully charming and amusing together.

Their chemistry is even more palpable now that they’re the protagonists of their own story. It’s a strange feeling watching Bettany portray Vision again, but his terrific performance comes to demonstrate that the viewer’s connection with the character is as humanly compelling as any other. However, Olsen is the real star of the show. I admit that I might be a bit biased since she is one of my favorite actresses working today, but Olsen proves why she’s worthy of bigger roles in Hollywood outside of the MCU. An unbelievable emotional range, excellent comedic timing, exquisite expressiveness, and an impressive capability of drastically and quickly changing styles. An Emmy nomination wouldn’t be surprising.

The main storyline revolves around Wanda’s apparently ideal life with Vision. How? That is the intriguing mystery, which exponentially receives more clues after each episode. A certain symbol points to an organization that will undoubtedly make Marvel fans scream with excitement, right from the very first episode (if you look closely, you’ll find it). This is the first MCU content since July 2019, so the stakes are inevitably high as Matt Shakman must fulfill the mission of bringing back the enthusiasm for the respective universe. Shakman and Schaeffer employ weirdness and unconventional storytelling that transform the series into an extremely captivating story, even though the main answer for what’s happening seems quite clear.

Technically, Christophe Beck’s score is the standout. From the timely sound effects of classic television to specific songs that play during certain moments, Beck delivers a score that elevates the overall show. The opening credits are unique and always different, referencing various Eras of television (shoutout to Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez for composing the theme music). As for the rest, terrific editing from Tim Roche, Nona Khodai, and Zene Baker. The visual effects look seamless even in black-and-white, and Jess Hall’s cinematography cleverly resembles sitcoms attributes. Outstanding production design (Mark Worthington) as well.

All in all, after only three episodes, WandaVision proves to be as weird, mysterious, and exceptionally captivating as it intends to be. Matt Shakman and Jac Schaeffer deliver a surprisingly hilarious show with just the right amount of hints to what’s truly happening. Even though the global answer seems rather predictable, creative storytelling builds an atmosphere of uncertainty and puzzling doubts that will leave viewers craving for the next episode. From the gorgeous black-and-white to Christophe Beck’s brilliant score, Wanda and Vision’s apparently ideal life is surrounded by technical attributes that pay homage to the Era of classic television. Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, and Kathryn Hahn are all fantastic, but Elizabeth Olsen is the indisputable star, showing her undeniable acting talent that might very well earn her an Emmy nod. As the first MCU content in more than a year, WandaVision conquered my full attention for the remaining episodes, which surely hold impactful revelations. It’s still unclear the real influence it will have in the films’ realm, but I can only assume it’s significant. Do not miss it!

Post-Finale Review
(based on the remaining episodes and the entire season) 

The following six episodes couldn't be better. The decade-spanning homage to sitcoms continues, but it exponentially decreases its attempts at humor and silly slapstick. As expected, a much more dramatic, emotional storyline takes hold of the narrative, each episode coming closer to give the viewers answers to the dozens of questions raised by the previous episodes. A few more puzzles arise with the introduction/revelation of characters who will definitely leave the audience incredibly excited, but it's the focus on Wanda's feelings that ultimately elevates this miniseries to some of the best content in the genre of superheroes.

The study of Wanda's grief and what she did to deal with the loss of the ones she loved the most is by far the most mysteriously fascinating aspect of the entire show. Even though most of Wanda's actions seem quite predictable from the get-go - especially in a non-detailed perspective - the storytelling choices and paths that Matt Shakman and the team of screenwriters come up with are quite imaginative. Every single viewer will remember a specific sentence forever since it's so powerful that it can even work as a healing mechanism to many people going through pain similar to Wanda's. Brilliant writing, from the pilot to the finale.

One massive advantage of one-season series is their immunity to ridiculously illogical, absurd fan theories and social media pressure, simply because it's already finished before the first episodes airs, so there's no way of the show getting influenced by the public's opinion. It's fun to theorize with friends and attempt to figure out what's truly happening, but when it reaches the levels of excessive fanboyism, it becomes dangerously annoying and hurtful to fans themselves. People create the most ludicrous theories surrounding characters and storylines based on incredibly ambiguous and subjective ""clues"" that are far from being remotely significant. Consequently, irrealistic expectations lead many of these fans to an impending letdown once the finale comes around.

Fortunately, I stayed sane and kept my expectations grounded, waiting patiently for the show to amaze me. The finale is a near-perfect ending to an utterly impressive series that will impact the future of the upcoming MCU series. Many viewers - mainly hardcore fans - will find it disappointing due to the inevitable dismissal of hyped theories, but overall, WandaVision will end up as a positive experience for a significant majority. I really only have minor issues with a particular episode where the overwhelming fan-service risks the logic of its presence, Josh Stamberg's annoyingly cliche character, and a certain outcome left a bit too vague for the series finale.

WandaVision is truly some of the best content ever seen in the genre of superheroes. From the mysteriously unconventional storytelling that never ceased to be incredibly captivating to the beautiful homage to decade-defining sitcoms, Jac Schaeffer and Matt Shakman approach grief and the different ways people handle it in an undoubtedly impactful manner. Despite the main narrative following a predictable path, the theory-inducing side stories and secondary characters throw the audience in loops of constant doubt, ultimately generating a surreal amount of hype for the next episode. The series never loses focus of its emotional core, which is connected to one of the greatest pros of one-season shows: these can't be influenced by absurd fan theories and online pressure. Both Elizabeth Olsen and Wanda prove they're part of the strongest members of the MCU, with the actress delivering an Emmy-worthy performance (shockingly outstanding range) and the character showing her true power prompted by her solitude and persevering love. Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, and Kathryn Hahn are magnificent as well, but in the end, it was Wanda's show all along.

4090,Wandavision,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery, Drama",8.219,"So many missed opportunities in this series makes for a disappointing watch, although the series does end on a higher note.  

The premise is sound - a powerful mutant (oh, we're not allowed to use that word) - sorry, witch, is grieving for her love and reverts to what she thinks is the idealised family - based on TV sitcoms.  Here you could do so much - an episode per decade (nup, some are randomly skipped), add in creepy themes (this is started, but never really done well), expound on the puppet-master theme, explore grieving, or having a family as a Supe, or trying to be normal. You could mash up the Truman Show with Pleasantville and the Incredibles with a touch of the Stepford Wives (and even have them caused by the antagonist of the series to either try to gain a friend, or to unnerve and outdo Wanda - seriously, is the antagonist just evil with no human desires?).  But we got this average slump of a series which wants to be more...a whole lot more.

Plusses - Olsen and Bettany are on form and seem to relish the increased screen time for the characters - their magic show is a highlight of the droll early episodes.  The minor cast are great too with Caulfield and Hahn being highlights.  Remarkably, Dennings is held back which (compared to her last showing in the Dark World) we are all thankful for.  And the set design and score are masterful showing true homage to the shows that came before.  

Negatives - Besides the aforementioned lost opportunities, there is an added plot about the military which was not needed (could have just had this set in Wanda's head and expounded more on the creepiness of this concept).  Canned laughter is over used to the extreme - none of the shows referenced used it that much, and this is not even a plot point to signify that something is wrong with the world.  Characters appear and disappear and are not followed up on,  nor is there explanation given as to why (eg Quicksilver).  And consequences have no place here.  

In such a hyped up show, I was expecting more than this droll output which fails to shine despite the best intentions of Bettany, Olsen and the cast.  

My hopes for something outstandingly creepy or scary from the next Dr Strange movie are now definitely lessened.","Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Kathryn Hahn, Teyonah Parris, Randall Park","many miss opportunities series make disappoint watch , although series end higher note . premise sound - powerful mutant ( oh , 're allow use word ) - sorry , witch , grieve love revert think idealise family - base tv sitcoms . could much - episode per decade ( nup , randomly skip ) , add creepy theme ( start , never really do well ) , expound puppet-master theme , explore grieve , family supe , try normal . could mash truman show pleasantville incredibles touch stepford wive ( even cause antagonist series either try gain friend , unnerve outdo wanda - seriously , antagonist evil human desire ? ) . get average slump series want ... whole lot . plusses - olsen bettany form seem relish increase screen time character - magic show highlight droll early episodes . minor cast great caulfield hahn highlight . remarkably , dennings hold back ( compare last show dark world ) thankful . set design score masterful show true homage show come . negative - besides aforementioned lose opportunities , add plot military need ( could set wanda 's head expound creepiness concept ) . can laughter use extreme - none show reference use much , even plot point signify something wrong world . character appear disappear follow , explanation give ( eg quicksilver ) . consequences place . hype show , expect droll output fail shine despite best intentions bettany , olsen cast . hop something outstandingly creepy scary next dr strange movie definitely lessen .",-1,0
4090,Wandavision,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery, Drama",8.219,"_WandaVision_ is a fairly standard MCU entry disguised as a unique MCU entry, and its biggest problem is a lack of commitment to the bit. The eerie set-up of an idealistic, suburban rom com used as a false life for Wanda to live is genius(!!) and deserves **so** much better than being knocked to the curb by the final few episodes in exchange for more bland concepts. The scattered focus with all the characters means that not one idea really gets as much development as you would hope, which is especially prevalent once the whole thing wraps up. By the time you really get a grasp of the true extent of Wanda's struggle, you're pretty much at the final episode, and the established style through TV shows of the era is absent.

It's too bad, because I didn't really dislike any of the plot threads either, they just sort of come and go? I think Darcy Lewis adds plenty to the series, but there needed to be more of her to prevent her from just seeming like a front for a boatload of exposition. Jimmy Woo is **always** a treat, but I don't know why his run-in with the ""surprise"" antagonist was made out to be as big a deal as it was when it's really only a temporary inconvenience that adds nothing to anything?

Wanda's entanglements go all over the place, from memories of her husband, her brother, to even her desire for kids. It's a lot to tackle, and I just don't think the writers stuck the landing. The measures Wanda takes for sake of conformity and repression of her past were such strong themes that for a second I thought the series was going to commit to making her the antagonist, which would've been a cool inversion of the hero in comparison to where she was before. This angle could've also helped emphasize the true damage that can come from acting on your grief with no rhyme or reason. The bittersweet peaks of the show between the two title characters are powerful when done right, and sometimes even made me want to bat an 8/10 for the show. Unfortunately, everything I mentioned with Wanda is scrapped for another surprise twist villain instead, and the finale just turns into every Marvel fight ever, so no, the show did not end up meeting its own goals.

Overall a kind of cool experience, but I already can't remember half the characters or episodes, so I don't think this will be sticking with me for very long.

4090,Wandavision,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery, Drama",8.219,"WandaVision is a bold, genre-bending triumph that redefines what superhero storytelling can be. The series opens with a surreal plunge into classic TV sitcoms, paying homage to I Love Lucy and Bewitched—a bold move that quickly proves its worth. WandaVision reminds us that emotional stakes can hit the hardest in a universe of super-powered battles.

Elizabeth Olsen is mesmerizing. Her portrayal of Wanda Maximoff is a masterclass in character evolution, as she moves effortlessly between sitcom whimsy and gut-wrenching emotional depth. Wanda’s desperate attempt to control her unraveling world is heartbreaking and terrifying, and Olsen makes you feel every ounce of that pain. Paul Bettany matches her performance with a comedic brilliance that brings new layers to Vision, turning their shared scenes into captivating emotional duets.

But WandaVision is far more than a love letter to nostalgia—it’s a fully immersive experience. Each episode meticulously recreates a different TV era, from the black-and-white charm of the 1950s to the neon flash of the 80s. The period details, from set designs to costumes, are spot-on, giving the series a rich visual texture. You’d be forgiven for thinking you were watching an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show—until the cracks in the facade start to show, hinting at a far darker reality lurking underneath.

Visually, WandaVision is a feast. The shifting aesthetics aren’t just clever flourishes but integral to the story. As the series moves through different eras of TV, the visual style mirrors Wanda’s emotional unraveling. The glossy perfection of early sitcoms begins to fracture, reflecting the way grief and trauma distort her perception of reality. This isn’t just a fun gimmick—it’s a profoundly affecting metaphor for Wanda’s internal collapse, making her unravel something you feel as much as you see.

At its core, WandaVision is about grief, trauma, and identity. Wanda isn’t just mourning Vision—she’s grappling with who she is after everything she’s lost. Her immense power allows her to bend reality to her will, yet she’s unable to confront the emotional wreckage inside. The show visually represents this struggle, with each glitch and shift in her constructed reality as a metaphor for her fractured sense of self. WandaVision brilliantly captures a woman at war with her identity, trying to reconcile her past, pain, and future.

This identity crisis shapes Wanda’s every decision. Unable to let go of her trauma, she creates a world where she can hide from it. But as the cracks in her illusion grow, it becomes clear that even her immense power can’t protect her from the truth. The show’s layered narrative and visual style turn Wanda’s story into a poignant meditation on how trauma reshapes our sense of self and how running from grief only deepens the wounds.

One scene that perfectly encapsulates this tension is the dinner sequence in the first episode. What starts as a lighthearted sitcom fare quickly spirals into something unsettling as Wanda struggles to control her reality. The laughter fades, the lighting shifts and the discomfort is palpable as her carefully constructed world teeters on the edge of collapse. In moments like these, WandaVision masterfully balances its tonal shifts, moving from quirky homage to psychological thriller with a deft touch.

The series is a slow burn, but that deliberate pacing makes its emotional depth possible. WandaVision takes its time, allowing the audience to sit with Wanda’s grief and confusion. This might feel jarring for some, especially for those expecting the fast-paced action Marvel is known for. But this slower pace is essential to the show’s impact—it gives the emotional stakes time to breathe, and the payoff is worth the wait. As Wanda’s world unravels, the tension builds not through action but through her illusions’ slow, steady collapse.

Marvel’s decision to prioritize emotional complexity over explosive action in WandaVision significantly departs from its usual formula. This shift signals a broader evolution in superhero media that embraces introspection and character-driven storytelling. WandaVision shows that superhero stories can be just as much about our internal battles as the external ones, setting a new standard for what the genre can achieve.

While Olsen and Bettany are the heart of the series, the supporting cast also shines. Kathryn Hahn is a standout as Agnes, bringing comedic flair and a sinister undercurrent to her role. Her shift from a nosy neighbor to something far more ominous is one of the series’ most thrilling transformations. Teyonah Parris, as Monica Rambeau, adds emotional depth to the broader MCU connections, grounding the story while bringing her vulnerabilities to the forefront. Monica’s own experience with loss, having been snapped away and returning to find her mother gone, mirrors Wanda’s grief, adding layers to the show’s exploration of trauma. Both actresses enhance the ensemble, making WandaVision a rich tapestry of performances.

Matt Shakman and Jac Schaeffer deserve immense credit for crafting a show that blends absurdity with emotional resonance. The tonal shifts—from sitcom pastiche to psychological horror—could have easily derailed the narrative, but instead, they heighten the series’ complexity. Shakman’s direction and Schaeffer’s writing push the boundaries of superhero storytelling, resulting in a series that feels as innovative as it does intimate.

Another scene that stands out is Wanda’s confrontation with Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn) in later episodes. This moment exemplifies the total collapse of Wanda’s illusion, and Agatha’s role as a manipulator intensifies the tension. The scene is a high-stakes emotional showdown that strips away Wanda’s defenses, forcing her to confront the pain she’s buried under layers of sitcom facades. This confrontation highlights the show’s seamless ability to shift from personal drama to supernatural spectacle, all while keeping the emotional core intact.

Of course, WandaVision isn’t for everyone. Its experimental structure and slower pacing may alienate viewers expecting the fast-paced, action-heavy fare typical of the MCU. But for those willing to embrace its reflective nature, the series offers a more profound, more emotionally charged experience. It’s a gamble that pays off in ways that redefine what superhero television can be.

WandaVision isn’t just a standout in the MCU—it’s a standout in modern television. Its blend of genres and experimentation with form transcends the superhero genre, positioning itself alongside Legion, which uses genre as a framework to explore deep emotional and psychological territory. WandaVision proves that superhero stories can be as rich, layered, and complex as any prestige drama, showing that sometimes, the most compelling battles are the ones we fight within ourselves.

Hogan is played by ill fated Bob Crane, who wise cracks his way through the series, making fools of the Germans.
To be honest, this series is very racist against German (pale, fair haired, European) males, while being accepting of German females.
That was the standard racism and neo Nazi Hollywood ideology of the seventies. The show actually paid homage to Adolf and Eva by declaring women to be fair and blond, while sending German males to die in war.
That was the American ideology of the late sixties up through the eighties, and it's not possible to watch movies or TV shows from that era without noticing it.

4148,Castlevania: Nocturne,"Animation, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.9,"""I was going to say something witty, but f*** it""

I liked the first Castlevania series. While it wasn&#39;t perfect, it did grow on me and had some amazing animations and memorable characters. This new series though, fails at all that, but works as a great sleeping pill.

First off, the obvious: the animations are a let down, except for maybe one fight. Gone is the gorgeous spell slinging from the first.

The writing is incredibly weak. You can tell that the writers are on strike and the story was written by chatgpt prefixed with &#34;imagine that you are a teenager with Tourette...&#34;. The review title is an actual quote from the show, I kid you not.

The story is filled with cliches and there were so many deus ex machina and woman in the fridge tropes that I lost count. The French revolution should have made for an interesting background setting (and a much better story), except the show does very little with it. There&#39;s an amorphous &#34;revolution&#34; that apparently threatens vampires by listening to their teenage girl leader, and then running away when the fighting starts.

The only saving grace is the great, creepy music, but that&#39;s nowhere near enough to save this show from mediocrity.","Edward Bluemel, Thuso Mbedu, Pixie Davies, Sydney James Harcourt, Nastassja Kinski","`` go say something witty , f * * * '' like first castlevania series . & # 39 ; perfect , grow amaze animations memorable character . new series though , fail , work great sleep pill . first , obvious : animations let , except maybe one fight . go gorgeous spell sling first . write incredibly weak . tell writers strike story write chatgpt prefix & # 34 ; imagine teenager tourette ... & # 34 ; . review title actual quote show , kid . story fill cliches many deus ex machina woman fridge tropes lose count . french revolution make interest background set ( much better story ) , except show little . & # 39 ; amorphous & # 34 ; revolution & # 34 ; apparently threaten vampires listen teenage girl leader , run away fight start . save grace great , creepy music , & # 39 ; nowhere near enough save show mediocrity .",1,1

4165,"Gwanggaeto, The Great Conqueror",Drama,5.0,"The drama features the type of king that would befriend the cruelest of enemies and forgive the greatest of sins. The embodiment of a true anime protagonist! I have way too many problems with the narrative to begin counting, even when disregarding the historical accuracy aspect. Loyalty has no real weight, decades of loyalty would parish and turns into a betrayal over a small lie. The drama does a poor job bridging its narrative and filling the gaps between historical facts and a drama production storytelling. Speaking of production, I would classify it almost unwatchable from a production value standpoint. Extreme overreaction and intense movement with every move from every single male character. Borderline comical circus behavior and it's a poor portrayal of the times of wars from back then. The make up situation was rough too and you can see that from the first 10 minutes. I caught some warped mustaches not lined up with the lips and some of them weren't even sticking properly with visible tape around it. The cinematography consisted of approximately 70% of extreme face close up shots, if you aren't far enough from the screen it will cause nausea. In my opinion, the drama had its climax and highest moments around the middle parts while the rest were a boring follow up with the last 20 episodes being the worst of storytelling. The only impressive aspect of the drama was the male lead's ability to maintain a deep aggressive vocal register with every word he muttered. His throat must be destroyed!

4208,The Leftovers,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.6,"The Leftovers is a show that has had a quite fascinating trajectory. An HBO show with an all-star cast, created by the co-creator of the magnificent Lost. How could it all go wrong? And yet, it almost did. Season 1 at first glance was an inconsistent, tumultuous show of middling quality. Moments of genuine quality interspersed with plodding mediocrity. That said, upon a rewatch, my opinion of it significantly improved. It always was a good show, with some truly mesmerising moments (see Holy Wayne hugging Nora). Season 2 is where it really came alive, however. Whereas season 1 might have seemed overly gimmicky and lacking focus, season 2 delivered a truly engaging, engrossing story with the perfect mix of excitement, surreality and detailed characterisation. By season 3, critics were hailing it as one of the greatest shows of all time.

Season 3 introduced the typical Leftovers’ blend of humour, the bizarre (dogs taking over the world?), entertainment and gut-wrenching misery. Like the other magnificent, emotionally driven, character based show of recent times ‘Rectify’, this show could be considered ‘misery porn’. Though I love it! However, I do feel season 3 is something I will need to watch again. It had many moments of great quality, and it was excellent, but it felt almost a bit too chaotic and lacking focus at times. Moving on, whilst the show has a very strong cast, Justin Theroux is the real acting heavyweight. Indeed, the man is an acting God who should be a Hollywood A lister. Scott Glenn was spectacular in season 3 and Carrie Coon, plus Christopher Eccleston, were never anything short of magnificent. Eccleston’s episodes were always great and full of substance; whilst Coon excelled in the finale, signing off with great aplomb.

I have now watched this episode twice and both times I was struck by the exposition early on, where Nora reveals how she was allowed access to the chamber. For a show as adult and intellectual as this, it’s clumsy; however, it’s a minor gripe. The show soon made up for it with one of the first truly emotive scenes in an episode with a plethora of them. Matt and Nora said goodbye - joking at first - then Matt revealed his crisis of faith, and how petrified he was of perishing due to his cancer, leaving his son growing up without a father. It’s all very raw and visceral, and an incredible engagement resonates with the audience, to a level which very few shows have ever been capable of doing. Reminiscing about losing her kids, Nora steps into the chamber and says goodbye to her brother. There’s various flashbacks to old scenes in this episode, and it works as an homage to the show, much like the recent Trainspotting sequel did to the former (see the closing scene teasing the introduction of The Prodigy’s remix of Lust for life, before breaking into the credits, for an education in how to close a movie). It’s all constructed with tremendous finesse.

After getting into the chamber, time skips forward many years into the future, and an aged Nora is now living a new life in Australia. We’re given no explanation regarding what’s transpired since, and initially it’s unclear if she’s even in ‘our’ world. Kevin soon tracks her down, pretending he thinks they never had a relationship, and only briefly knew each other. The new Kevin seems softened, with restrained emotion. The audience is left unclear whether he’s telling the truth and everything is a bit ambiguous. It’s worth pointing out that this episode showcases the startling cinematography and stylistic techniques that illustrates this show’s quality. We see some truly beautiful shots of the Australian landscape and the production values are that of a big budget Hollywood movie.

Nora agrees to take Kevin up on an invitation to attend a ‘dance’, later revealed to be a wedding. Guests at this wedding are expected to wear beads. Nora rejects, and afterwards beads are placed around a goat’s neck, which proves significant later. The best scene of the entire show soon occurs, and one of the most powerful I have ever seen. The soulful, soothing elegance of ‘I’ve Got Dreams to Remember’, by Otis Redding starts playing and both characters proceed to dance. The music plays in harmony with the events construed and it all just blends to perfection in a scene dripping with sentiment. Kevin breaks down in tears of joy, but Nora tells him that this is fake and storms off, just as the crescendo really builds. The melancholic music plays out and Kevin is left standing as a broken man, drowning in misery. The Leftovers isn’t just a TV show, it’s a work of art.

Later on, Nora hears a goat whining in agony up a hill: the goat from the wedding has become tangled in a fence due to the beads. As the empowering, classical theme music builds, thunder roars, and Nora removes the tangled beads, placing them around her neck. She looks to the pitch black sky and the intense music culminates. Now accepting the beads, Nora is finally embracing her sins. The biblical references are obvious and the haunting imagery is incredibly powerful. The characters in The Leftovers are morally ambiguous and that is part of the show’s quality. Nora is capable of doing some quite reprehensible things and can be quite horrible to people. She is a highly flawed, but ultimately good person.

We soon see the real Kevin Garvey. He tracks down Nora again, breaks down and reveals he has spent all these years searching all over Australia for her. The emotion is overpowering. His excuse for his different recollection of events was he wanted to start afresh. The reasoning is a little flimsy, but it makes for an interesting story! The final scene soon plays out and whilst the wedding scene might be the créme de la créme of The Leftovers, this scene couldn’t be more emphatically emotive. The twist is revealed, though it’s of little consequence. This was a show focusing on dialogue and characterisation, with themes of tragedy, redemption and love permeating through it. Nora reveals that she did find her family, but they were happy, and so ultimately she travelled back. She desperately missed Kevin, but couldn’t tell him the truth. I know there’s some theories that Nora is lying, but I prefer to go with the events as they were explained. Kevin tells her he believes her, engulfed in tears, and the emotion displayed is incredible. Having spent a huge chunk of his life searching for her, he now has his woman again.

As the closing credits played out I sat in silence, awestruck by the magnificence I had just watched. While San Junipero was an excellent recent TV episode with similar themes, this obliterated it. The Leftovers was a show that had all manner of bizarre happenings - and a hugely talented ensemble cast - but the finale just focused on two characters and attempted nothing spectacular. And how it succeeded. The show ended on a rare happy note and it’s a real shame a show of this quality only lasted three seasons. Still, if people are happy to sit through 12 seasons of The Big Bang Theory, that’s their prerogative. Farewell to The Leftovers, one of the greatest shows of all time.

4284,Kaiju No. 8,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.6,"Kaiju No. 8 (2024): A Monster Mash with a Heart (and Room for Improvement)

Kaiju No. 8 bursts onto the scene with a premise as intriguing as its colossal kaiju: a regular dude, Kafka Hibino, becomes a monster himself.  This unique twist on the classic kaiju narrative is just the first course in a series that promises a delectable blend of action, mystery, and relatable characters. While the story itself is a solid 8/10, with a strong start and engaging world-building, the animation quality holds it back from achieving true greatness.

A World Under Siege: A Familiar Premise with a Fresh Twist

Kaiju No. 8 doesn't waste time establishing its world. We're thrust into a Japan constantly under attack by monstrous kaiju, forcing humanity to rely on the valiant Japanese Defense Force (JDF) for protection. This isn't your typical superhero story, though.  Kafka, our protagonist, exemplifies the toll this constant threat takes. He's not some hotshot teenager destined for greatness. He's an older man, burdened by past failures and the drudgery of a civilian cleanup job. This adds a layer of depth often missing in the genre, making Kafka's journey to become a hero all the more compelling.

The Power of Friendship: A Budding Romance and a Hopeful Future

One of the most endearing aspects of Kaiju No. 8 is the relationship between Kafka and his childhood friend, Mina Ashiro. Now a captain in the JDF, Mina embodies the dream they once shared of joining the fight. Their dynamic is a breath of fresh air in a genre often dominated by brooding loners. The show delicately explores the wistfulness of unfulfilled promises and the power of a shared dream, hinting at a potential future romance that feels pure and genuine. Here's hoping the series continues to develop this heartwarming connection.

The Mystery Unfolds: A World Rich with Potential

The series masterfully balances its monster-bashing with intriguing mysteries. The source of the kaiju and the nature of Kafka's transformation are just scratching the surface. Each episode leaves you wanting more, eager to unravel the larger conspiracy at play. The world-building is rich and well-developed, with details about the JDF's structure and the different types of kaiju offering a glimpse into the complex ecosystem created by Naoya Matsumoto.

A Stumble in the Kaiju Rampage: The Animation Holds Back the Onslaught

Now, let's address the elephant in the room, or rather, the kaiju in the animation. While the story is undeniably captivating, the animation quality is a noticeable stumbling block. Given the high production value of the series, the art style feels like a missed opportunity. The character designs are decent, but the fight scenes lack the fluidity and dynamic energy one expects from a monster-battling anime. The backgrounds, while functional, could benefit from a touch more detail and vibrancy.  Perhaps the animation improves as the series progresses, but for now, it holds Kaiju No. 8 back from achieving its full potential.

A Promising Debut with Room to Grow

Despite the animation hiccup, Kaiju No. 8 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The story is strong, the characters are relatable, and the world is brimming with potential.  It's a show with its heart in the right place, offering a fresh take on the kaiju genre with a dash of human drama.

This was made before the western world got infected by ""nazi-esk"" social media woke-cancer.  It is a sickness I am happy to say the East seems immune; and gratefully so.
The show itself tried in the first two episodes to have a story but that soon gave way to the scrumptious/genius decision of fanservice.  It is not a favored way to go when viewing characters who have special powers at their command, but it worked here.  I have seen Seinen where the company tried to ""soft-pitch"" the fanservice in the show and it ended up leaving the audience frustrated and annoyed. (Ex. _That Time I was Reincarnated as a Slime_)  But when the company commits to fanservice, it is a lovely thing to behold.  
The show itself is not bad for what it is.  There is a boy, a harem, but they are not all trying to be his girlfriend.  There is an interest, but she is competiing with two other girls only on the fear of losing the boy she can't seem to admit to liking more than just a friend.  The story from there takes on episodes that center around problems that only they, as the students' self-appointed protectors, can solve.  
There are both censored and uncensored versions of the series; and it's not difficult at all to follow along.  If you're a guy, you'll like it.

Finally, finally, finally! I'm finally done with this 155 episode series! It took me 3 or 4 months of casually watching on Wednesday afternoons, (because that's when I have the most time off). But around the season 4 finale, I decided to just binge the rest of the series just to get it over with and get it off my watchlist. It was good and enjoyable for the majority of the series, but after the season 3 finale, it was clear that 4Kids wasn't gonna let their merchandising cash cow go that easily and started milk the series all it's worth and unfortunately that had an effect on the quality of the series overall and lead to some pretty lackluster seasons. The fact that you can just skip seasons 4-7 and you're still all caught up for Turtles Forever is just the most hilarious thing to me.

I guess a good place to start is with the characters, which is probably one of my favorite parts about the show. Leonardo was pretty bland, it's just what you come to expect from this character. I guess they did try to give him an internal conflict in season 4 where he couldn't save his brothers in the season 3 finale and becomes more aggressive and brooding, but he just becomes a worse Raph and his morals are completely out of whack to an insane degree. Like he even at one point cuts open Splinter's head just because ""I learned everything"", but fortunately he goes back to his bland self during the middle chunk of the season. Donatello was just so boring. It had no personality outside of ""the tech wiz"" and that's probably the reason why he was the least utilized out of all the turtles. I mean he had also had an internal conflict in season 7 where he blames himself for  him and his brothers losing Splinter in cyberspace and starts obsessing over collecting all the bits while distancing his brothers away from him. So basically, its just Leo's arc in season 4 again, but actually relevant to the plot. It wasn't that bad, but he went back to his boring self in the middle of season 7. Raphael was honestly the highlight of all the turtles in this show. I think this type of show really works well with his explosive personality and can lead to fun situations. Raph and Casey have great and natural chemistry together which is something that the other TMNT shows haven't really replicated because of how different his personality and character treats are in those shows compared to Raph. He even says ""Joe mama"" in season 1, so that's how you know he's the best turtle. Michelangelo is probably the least memorable he's ever been while also being an annoying selfish jerk in the process. Like 60% of his dialog is just pop culture references and it gets really tiring, especially for over 150 episodes. He also takes advantage of Splinter's kindness and constantly slacks off and doesn't take his martial arts seriously, like in the episode ""Graduation Day of 2105"", he doesn't gradate along side his brothers because of his video game obsession, so he's put to the test to actually graduate and you'd he would learn his lesson after that episode, but NOPE, he just goes to his annoying self afterwards. Where the selfish jerk part of his character comes in is with ""Turtle Titan"". I'm gonna save how I feel about the superheroes later in this review, but Micky is just a huge jerk to anyone who he thinks is stealing his """"""thunder"""""" as Turtle Titan and actually assaults the person that was inspired by Turtle Titan and his own brother Raphael full-on incrediboy style purely fueled by his jealousy. That's just a new level of patheticness that other Mickys from any other piece of TMNT media would never stoop to. Splinter was pretty good in this, but he's probably the weakest out of all the Splinters in  the TMNT shows, but I don't think that should be considered an insult, if anything it shows how consistent  the quality has been for this character over the years. Splinter in the original 1987 cartoon was just a wise and caring father that helped anchor the show in all it's weirdness. Splinter in the Rise series isn't exactly a great father or teacher, but he makes up for it being 10 times more entertaining than any other Splinter and having such a unique backstory and genuinely heartfelt moments that the series takes its time with. I haven't rewatched the 2012 series yet, so I can't talk about it's Splinter too in-depth, but from what I remember he was the best origin and character drama. But I'd have to rewatch the series to back up that claim. Splinter in this show is still good and serves his purpose to the overall story, but to be quite honest I never liked how in the original comics, Splinter was just a pet rat copying his owner Hamato Yoshi. It made his journey and struggle with the Shredder so much more personal and one of the only things that I think the original cartoon improved over the comics is that they made Splinter and Hamato Yoshi the same person. It makes so much more sense with the whole mutation part of the franchise and two martial artist raised as brothers slowly drift apart because of a love is so much more interesting than a pet rat and a chewing gum. Also yeah, this show tweaked the origin of Hamato Yoshi to fit more in these series continuity and the changes really water down the impact that the story might of had in this show. Also I don't think Splinter's voice in the show is a really naturally fit compared Peter Renaday from the original cartoon. WOW, this review is already this long and I've only talked about the turtles and Splinter. Now for the human character. April is down down-to-earth she's ever been and a great alley to the turtles. Also Casey in this, BEST Casey. He's so entertaining and you can really tell they took a lot of inspiration from Elias Koteas's performance  as Casey from the 1990 movie which is cool. Like I said before, Casey and Raph have great chemistry together, but I think he has even better chemistry with April. This might be my favorite part about the whole show, Casey and April are practically made for each other. Their interactions are so wholesome and their relationship grew in a natural and believable way over the course of all 7 seasons. Okay granted, their relationship was put on hold after the season 3 finale, but that didn't ruin the impact that the series sendoff had on me. Imagine growing up on this show over the course of 6 years and seeing Casey and April finally tie the knot and it's no surprise that I got a little misty-eyed because even though I didn't grow up on this show, I had the chance to grow attached to these characters for over 150 episodes. Okay, so on to the bad guys. Shredder being a Utrom in this show is kind of a joke. I mean you can’t just kill off shredder so easily nowadays like in the comics because of how iconic he’s become over the years. So they completely overhaul his origin in this show and turned him into a Utrom. I kind of find it funny that the show actually expects me to take this piece of chewing gum seriously. Krang has always been somewhat of a comedic character in almost every incarnation he’s been in, but I know that making Krang intimidating can be done properly thanks to the Rise movie, but this show's lukewarm 4Kids violence doesn’t really help Shredder’s case. And besides, even without that fact, Shredder is such a boring and one note obstacle for the turtles and he's no where near as memorable or intimidating like other Shredders. Wow, this show has my least favorite Shredder AND my least favorite Karai, HOW NICE!!! Yeah, I'm really a big fan of Karai in this. She acts so oblivious to Shredder's villainy to a ridiculous degree and her refusing to accept basic fact is just plane stupid and a gigantic hypocrite. She becomes the next Shredder for season 4, but it doesn't really change anything because how similar her morals are compared to the original Shredder to make it an interesting swap. Hun is honestly one of my favorite characters in the whole show. It's Hun! HE'S SO EPIC!!! I mean unironically he's a great threat and it's really interesting to the his undying loyalty to the Shredder and seeing how effects him also being the leader The Purple Dragons. Oh, did I mention he's funny? With one exception, I think he's the most enjoyable character in the whole show while also serving as a good threat to the Turtles. I guess you're wondering who's that one exception, well I'm here to tell you that it's FREAKIN' BAXTER STOCKMAN!!! I can't get enough of this absolute legend. I love how self-absorbed he is even after when he's taken apart limb after limb until he's just a brain in a jar. It's also kinda sad that people just won't let him die and constantly manipulating his genius for their own self benefit. He's a mixture of being funny and tragic at the same time. Bishop was such a cool threat. Like at the beginning, I thought he suffered from a really generic design, but I guess the artists caught wind of that and gave him some cool and memorable armor, so it all works out. I like how cunning he is like how he manipulates the government into gaining more funding for his security branch by staging a fake alien invasion which leads to some crucial plot beats for season 4. I'm not a huge fan of what they did to him in season 6, but it's fine I guess. Okay, I'm done with all the regular characters, so now I'm gonna talk about all the seasons individually now. I'm not gonna sit on seasons 1-3 too much because they're all good and I don't have to much to say about them.

Season 1 was pretty good overall and a good stepping stone and introduction for the later seasons, but my problem with this season is the filler. This season only adapts the FIRST 4 ISSUES and they pad it out for way too long. I'll only take you about 2 hours at most to read those 4 issues and I'll take about 10 hours to watch this season at least nonstop, so I'll let you decide which is more worth it. But this season did have a really good overarching story that holds up compared to the other seasons and this is the only season where Utrom Shredder is actually intimating

Season 2 was slightly better than the first in my opinion. I haven't fully read this part of the comics yet and don't know how faithful it is compared to the original, I liked seeing these two tyrants fight over a portal machine that doesn't even work when the Utroms have working portals right there. I also liked the new Traximus character, the Triceraton leader Zanramon was really fun and memorable, and I liked the gladiator arena and prison episodes. Also this season introduced the Battle Nexus which was pretty fun setup and I liked seeing Usagi cameos every now and then. I guess Honeycutt kinda got on my nerves after awhile, the human tyrant General Blanque was pretty forgettable and lame and is never even brought again when season 6 rolls around. Drako and Ue-Sama aren't really that interesting antagonists and it's kinda weird that a rat is invited to  Battle Nexus and not the Ninja Tribunal. But it's still a very enjoyable season regardless of it's problems. 

Season 3 was still really good just like the last two seasons. I used to think this was the best season, but the more I really think about it, I think season 2 is just might be a smidge better overall. But I don't that should be a detriment to this season, it introduced Bishop! I wasn't that into the alien invasion coming to earth instead of the turtles going into an alien world, Honeycutt is the biggest idiot alive leading the Triceraton army back to earth after the turtles just got rid of them and then trying to surrender, and Honeycutt supposed sacrifice was honestly hilarious. Then the Ultimate Drako patch of anthology episodes came around and there all different in tone which was cool and refreshing. It's kinda weird how Ue-Sama turns into a child and I think Ultimate Daimyo was really nerfed for what happened in this season. Also the finale of this season gets rid of Utrom Shredder, but the writers of this show are definitely gonna regret that later down the line. Okay, here's a mini-ranking for the Ultimate Drako anthology episodes

1. Same As It Never Was:  Best episode in the whole show, no question
2. The Real World, Part 1: Really cute art style and it was cool seeing Usagi's world for the first time in animation. But I wish we got to see more Usagi's world more Tomoe Ame would have been nice if you know what I'm sayin'
3. Across the Universe: Pretty standard overall with cool racing moments, but it just feels like the usual shtick we come to know from this show
4. Reality Check: Really lame, I didn't like Splinter becoming evil, I didn't think they utilized the superhero gimmick enough, we didn't really get to explore this new superhero world, and Micky, obviously.

Season 4 was still good, but it felt like the beginning of the end for this show. This season does still does have a lot of personality to it. I thought it would be interesting to see the aftermath of Utrom Shredder leaving the show and seeing the repercussions because of that, but nothing really feels like anything changed the trajectory of the story. Like I said earlier in the review, Karai becoming the new Shredder really only feels like a palette swap and Leo just sulks for a bit until he meets The Ancient One. Hun takes a massive step back which was so weird, because you'd think they would utilize the Purple Dragons more sense Utrom Shredder is gone, but no. The main conflict for this season is mutations from the ooze of the fake aliens. Ignoring how the conflict starts in pretty dumb, the show never decided to fully explore all the cool possibilities the concept could of brought until the last few episodes because they needed to end the conflict before the next the next season. This season is more interested in it's filler plot lines than it's central one and while its good and fun filler, its still filler none the less. Also booooooo, the season finale blows tbh. There's no conclusive weight to it and its just a prologue for season 5 and it would be a cool first episode for the Ninja Tribunals, but as a finale to this already lackluster season, it's easily the worst one so far. Not a bad episode, it's pretty average on it's own, but nothing about it properly closes this chapter of this show. 

Ninja Tribunals (AKA Season 5) was okay. It's just inevitable that a long running series, especially a narrative one, would eventually decline in quality. Nothing about it feels like it naturally flows with the rest of the series and it more so feels like 4Kids trying to keep this show relevant and starts to get more gimmicky with their seasons even though it should of ended of a long time ago. It doesn't even feel like this season is canon for a majority of it and you would think they would at least acknowledge the Ninja Tribunal if their so important in the past 4 seasons. But no, they just shoehorned all these new plot lines and pretended they existed the whole time. The other acolytes are extremely boring characters with no personalities expect for the big guy who has a crush on the lady ninja and that's the extent of his character. I didn't care when the other acolytes supposedly died in episode 5 or when they came for the finale because the show didn't explore their origins or get me invested in their characters to make their fake out deaths feel earned. Also making Shredder in this show a copycat of the ""real"" Shredder makes him even lamer than he already was. You can tell that the writers regret killing off the Shredder, so they keep introducing different alterations of him that aren't technically Shredder, but he might as well be. And the most funniest aspect of this is that Ancient Shredder is the first passable Shredder in the whole show, which is hilarious seeing just by not making Shredder a piece of chewing gum automatically makes him a better Shredder. Then after episode 5, they make an episode about with the Justice Force and Nano which has almost nothing to do with the Ninja Tribunals at all and you'd think since this is a smallest season, they'd keep together a tighter narrative. The New World Order 2 parter was good and refreshing, but that just makes me think is there a a season finale set piece during the middle of the season, but April finally got the pilot a helicopter just like in the original opening was cool, but why did it take have seasons tho? Also the episode right after is just a prequel to the Ninja Tribunals and I don't really like it. I didn't like the framing device of baby turtles or their designs and them conveniently losing their memory was really dumb. It feels so tone deaf compared to the last 2 episodes, I get having a breather in between more important episodes, but can it not feel out of place? But at least we got to see Splinter tear up a bone monster limb by limb. The last three episodes, however, were pretty good and I wish the rest of the season was like this. Overall this season is decent and has it's moments, specifically with the ancient Shredder, but the Ninja Tribunal stuff itself I didn't really care for and other characters like April and Casey get sidelined pretty heavily. But if this was the series finale, I wouldn't mind. Also WHO THOUGHT CHANGING THE VOICE OF HUN WAS A GOOD IDEA?!?!?!?!

Fast Forward (AKA Season 6), I'm just gonna say it, is the sole reason that I gave this series as a whole A 6/10. If this season didn't exist, we would be living in 7/10 territory. But unfortunately, we don't live in that timeline. Like it's so weird. It has an entirely new art style probably just to keep up with modern times. I expectations were that the turtles were gonna travel from different points in time, but no they just go to 100 years into the future. It's like a mish-mash of Transformers: Animated and Spider-Man Unlimited and it was just considered another season for the original Spider-Man (1994) series, it doesn't make sense because of how different it is visually and tonally. Oh yeah, it's tone, they made more light-hearted and more reliant on cringe jokes that made me wanna die and it clashes so hard with the previous seasons that it makes feel like an entirely different show, which it might as well be. Cody was a huge dork and the biggest idiot alive by how it took him 19 episodes to figure out that his uncle was evil. Serling felt like a knock-off version of Drix from Osmosis Jones, but he's managed to grow on me overtime. But his fake-out sacrifice in episode 20 was utterly comical by how the writers thought that was a good and well though out emotional scene. The uncle character was such a lame, one note, and embarrassing antagonist for this season, that I missed the days of Utrom Shredder. There's this British robot cop, and I really need to an emphasis on him being British, and he was just there and he didn't make me feel anything. Starlee was innocent in all this, she is to this season what Babu Frik is to Rise of Skywalker. I guess there were a few cool episodes like ""Graduation Day of 2105"", ""Timing is Everything"", and ""DNA is Thicker than Water"", because those  episodes remind me that this show can still put out well thought out stories, I kinda forget that this was evenly remotely related to TMNT and those episodes just the exceptions in this season's overall mediocrity. Also the last episode was just some regular episode with no conclusive weight to it whatsoever. Also what makes Fast Forward even worse is that they don't even resolve all the conflicts. For all we know, the Uncle is still out and about trying to kill his nephew, Cody is still forced to work as the head of his company, and Bizarro Leo is still struggling between good and evil. I think that just goes to show  how incompetent this season's storytelling is. This season overall is so tonally jarring compared to the other 6 seasons and that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but it decided it wanted to be another season rather than A completely different entry in the franchise that we could just collectively put in the back of our heads.

Back to the Sewers was kind of a good return to form of this series, but i feel I'm tricking myself into liking it more because the new theme song is absolutely fire! I just thought it was gonna be an Wolverine and the X-Men style of intro where it's just orchestrated music, but TMNT had other plans and I'm so glad I was wrong. I like in the first episode it still opens up with Fast Forward intro, because that makes sense because the turtles are still in the future at the beginning, and the episode ends with the new intro. Viral from the last season becoming Cyber Shredder though backup memories in Cyberspace is really dumb because it raises the question of why didn't Karai just activate Cyber Shredder after Utrom Shredder left the show after season 3? It just feels like another example of how desperate the show runners are having Shredder in the show without having the ACTUAL Shredder, so they just make up new variants of him. Master Khan is pretty one note, but he does give off an intimating presents, so I'll give him that. Like I said way before, Donny sulks for a bit thinking its all his fault for losing Splinter in Cyberspace. Speaking of Cyberspace, that part of the season doesn't really feel dated and still holds up probably because it didn't focus  on trendy 2008 internet culture which I'm super thankful for. Also they redesigned the art style AGAIN to fit more inline with the 2007 movie, which i didn't really mind that much and was kind of welcome. I loved seeing Casey and April's relationship progress to where it is now, but a part of me wished that the proposal episode didn't didn't have any grand monster, I just wanted to see Casey try to propose to April with no strings attached. Also HUN'S REAL VOICE IS BACK AHHHHHHH!!!. There was an opportunity in episode 149 ""Identity Crisis"" to reference the events of of episode 72 ""Across the Universe"", they had the perfect setup of Raph losing his memory and they didn't capitalize on it, so what was that all about? Also HUN IS A HARDCORE GAMER NOW!?!?!? AND EPISODE 151 SAYS ""NOOB"" AND ""GAMER"" SO MANY TIMES THAT I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A STROKE!?!?!? But I guess it was all worth it to see that powerhouse of a series finale and I even got a little misty-eyed because i'm finally done with this series. It took months without end and writing this very review took me about 2 days because how much I had say, and while I did enjoy myself, I'm glad that I'm done and I finally see what all the hypes about.

Here's my ranking of all the seasons if you're wondering. 

1. Season 2
2. Season 3
3. Season 1
4. Back to the Sewers
5. Season 4
6. Ninja Tribunals
7. Fast Forward

Edit: Okay I forgot to talk about this because I couldn't figure out where to put this in the review, but don't you think it's a little weird how superheroes exist in this show? Like don't you think the turtles can just go public as superheroes and the Justice Force could back them up and the public would eventually except them?

4304,Grantchester,"Crime, Drama, Mystery",7.343,"Almost by necessity this description will include some spoilers. It would be useless to discuss eight seasons without some reveals.

My wife really loves the show. Don’t get me wrong; I also like it, just not as much. To be honest, a weakness I find might even be a strength to her. The plots behind their murder case are usually interesting. Boy oh boy, do they get a lot of confessions. But better that than then two of them always having to show up in court to testify against the perpetrators. They allow both Geordie and the vicars their case-solving moments. Geordie mostly gets his through his experience, legwork and instincts. The vicars just know a lot about a lot of stuff, and can talk to the witnesses, etc., in a way that draws them out of their protective shells. Miss Scott is also a great character. Even shallow PC Larry is given more depth in season 8 and becomes much more sympathetic. It was nice to see.

Away from the police station, we find one of the better encore casts out there. The performers playing Mrs. Chapman, Leonard, Daniel, Cathy Keaton and a few more are excellent and usually quite beleavable.

And even the two lead actors who combine to play the vicars are great actors— I just don’t like their characters. Their problems are nearly always self-inflicted and they seem helpless to do anything about them until loved ones step in and guide them. I ask myself if Will, who struggled with his love for Bonnie and overcame doubts to marry her, would the very next season suddenly leave her due to feelings of guilt having nothing to with her. Really? I know it is just to tug at heartstrings, but…

So if I place my review on the scales of justice, I hope it reflects that I do like the program and recommend it.

I want to spare a word about the bigots and haters out there who say the show is “woke,” a word used to not share their hate out loud. I reach for sympathy for them and can only say: “Boo-Hoo.” After many decades of all serious roles being white-only, they want period programming to reflect the “reality” of people of color being hidden away except for stereotypical roles. Maybe they weren’t as hidden as all that back then, but they were never represented in a meaningful way on tv and movies, so to be “realistic “ they must be hidden away still. Get over it, please. You may even like yourselves more.

4313,The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten,"Animation, Comedy",7.7,"This is a medicine for the heart. The story develops gracefully at a slow pace and stays focused on the two main characters. The writing and voice-acting are wholesome, mildly sweet, and soothing. There's light touches of comedy, tension, and sadness that help to add color and balance. I'd prescribe no more than 1-2 episodes each evening, right before bed, for a peaceful sleep. And I recommend watching episodes 11 & 12 together.

4342,All Creatures Great & Small,"Drama, Comedy",8.2,"This show of course is a reboot of the beloved show based on the beloved books from decades ago. Sometimes remakes of good productions seem doomed to failure, but I think this one is right on the mark: still a bit hokey, but smart, thoughtful and updated.

In fact, I actually like it better than the original series. Not because of the characters or the acting, for the cast from the original series was superb from top to bottom. The improvement for me is in the plotting and the writing in the new version. You expect the writers to make small changes from the original, just as the original series made changes from the books. I wouldn’t like it if I found myself watching the exact same show with different actors. 

The difference to me is how they made the changes. I will only use one example so as to not give anything away. The incident with Tristan collecting client payments on market day is handled differently from the original series, and it is done in a way to tie the subplot in with James’s treatment of the prize racehorse. It made the plot tighter. And other changes seem to veer away from straight comedic, almost slapstick scenes, into something more dramatic but not without humor.

So I salute the production team for staying true to the soul of the books while making quality changes to keep the story fresh and entertaining.

*** Just adding a note after viewing the Christmas special they showed close to the holiday. The episode pretty much confirms everything I said about the show in the above review. The changes from the original series continued with more of the new subplot with Mrs. Hall, and advancing the romance of James Herriot in the strikingly different way they had begun. But the way they handled the climax of the show was not overdramatized as some show would have done it. The Siegfried and Tristan characters are allowed more depth as well. This show isn’t played for laughs as much as the original, though there is humor, and it continues to impress me.","Nicholas Ralph, Samuel West, Anna Madeley, Rachel Shenton","show course reboot beloved show base beloved book decades ago . sometimes remake good productions seem doom failure , think one right mark : still bite hokey , smart , thoughtful update . fact , actually like better original series . character act , cast original series superb top bottom . improvement plot write new version . expect writers make small change original , original series make change book . ’ like find watch exact show different actors . difference make change . use one example give anything away . incident tristan collect client payments market day handle differently original series , do way tie subplot jam ’ treatment prize racehorse . make plot tighter . change seem veer away straight comedic , almost slapstick scenes , something dramatic without humor . salute production team stay true soul book make quality change keep story fresh entertain . * * * add note view christmas special show close holiday . episode pretty much confirm everything say show review . change original series continue new subplot mrs. hall , advance romance jam herriot strikingly different way begin . way handle climax show overdramatize show would do . siegfried tristan character allow depth well . show ’ play laugh much original , though humor , continue impress .",1,1

The dynamic between the village people created a lively and heartwarming atmosphere. Each character brought something unique to the table with lots potentials and the slow burn romance between the leads was a highlight, initially. However, as the focus shifted to the romance between the leads around episode 11, the vibrancy of the village dynamics began to fade and the the drama lost some of its spark. At that point, the drama turned into a very long compilation of cheesy uneventful dates sequences while neglecting the small-town dynamics and community interactions that initially drew me in. Their interactions became more unbearable as the drama went on and the male leads supposed problems were an additional let down. Anyway, it wasn't perfect to begin with, Yeong Guk & Hwa Jeong triangle and story was the weakest link in the village and borderline ruined many scenes. The drama could've definitely used more people in the village and more stories, even if it were to add more sidekicks. Moreover, many of the stories from the village started and ended within a few scenes/episodes. I really wanted to see more investment in the Pub owner rather than Yeong Guk triangle.

4425,Astrid Et Raphaëlle,Crime,7.9,"We have watched three series so far and are waiting for the most recent fourth one to drop, carried by PBS Masterpiece’s’Walter Presents’ collection. In French and subtitled, it is an excellent show and avoids a major potential pitfall. The show concerns the crime solving efforts of a woman who is as smart as Sherlock Holmes, but with zero social skills. This is due to her autism, and we quickly come to know her litany of fast-talking idiosyncrasies and ways of dealing with a life that feels overwhelming to her, with every small social exchange potentially an ordeal or at least awkward.

With this type of character with special needs and traits, it could be easy to fall into a pattern of repetition and cause every show to seem like merely a slight variation of each other. But the smart writing and on the mark acting avoids this crevasse. Her crime-solving colleague and eventual close friend Raphielle provides support and a shield to help Astrid deal with events and grow as a person. A support group of other austistic people provide further balance and assistance to her. Even the police coroner, after early antagonism, becomes a sort of fan to her and enjoys working with her sharp kind and encyclopedic memory.

Astrid’s growth in dealing with scary day to day life is handled with patience and is believable. Like many of the show’s characters, we root for her development and celebrate her small advances in the ongoing subplots as fairly complex murders are solved by this unusual crime-solving duo.","Sara Mortensen, Lola Dewaere, Benoît Michel","watch three series far wait recent fourth one drop , carry pbs masterpiece ’ ’ walter present ’ collection . french subtitle , excellent show avoid major potential pitfall . show concern crime solve efforts woman smart sherlock holmes , zero social skills . due autism , quickly come know litany fast-talking idiosyncrasies ways deal life feel overwhelm , every small social exchange potentially ordeal least awkward . type character special need traits , could easy fall pattern repetition cause every show seem like merely slight variation . smart write mark act avoid crevasse . crime-solving colleague eventual close friend raphielle provide support shield help astrid deal events grow person . support group austistic people provide balance assistance . even police coroner , early antagonism , become sort fan enjoy work sharp kind encyclopedic memory . astrid ’ growth deal scary day day life handle patience believable . like many show ’ character , root development celebrate small advance ongoing subplots fairly complex murder solve unusual crime-solving duo .",1,1
4430,Sweet Tooth,"Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",7.824,"# Today I enjoyed
## Sweet Tooth

Today I enjoyed: Sweet Tooth.

Sweet Tooth follows the character of the same nickname on a quest in a post apocalyptic world. And while this sounds like the premise of a ton of shows and movies out there, I thought it had a fresh approach and some good ideas. We quickly learn about ""The Sick"", which caused ""The great crumble"", which killed billions of people and ended society as we know it. ""The Sick"" seems to have been inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the writers neither try to shove it down the viewers throats, nor do they overdo the similarity. It is just something I could not overlook.

The show focuses on the main character by the name of Gus, or Sweet Tooth by nickname. We get to know him in Yellowstone National Park, where he and his father live. But the idyllic live gets disturbed one day and ultimately Gus has to go on a journey, that will not only change him and his life, but also the whole world and the remainders of humankind.

I liked this show for several reasons: First I love to see Nonso Anozie on a good show again. Secondly Gus is a great, sympatric character and is delivered nicely by Christian Convery. Third, the show has a lot of kids in it - which is very relevant to the story as you will quickly learn - and that works very well in this case. The characters are likeable, and the kids are doing a great job bringing them to live. The supporting cast also works well, but I cannot mention them all here. Let me close with James Brolin, who does the voice-over, and I fell a bit in love with his voice.

Overall, I really enjoyed this show and I cannot wait for the next season. Sure there are some well known tropes and story beads, but there is something fresh about this show and the characters are likeable, believable and mostly competently played. And there are definitely some characters sticking out, which you will spot along the way.

I can wholeheartedly recommend this show, enjoy!

It continued heading in a downward spiral shortly after midway point where it started to get stupid and pointless. Stupid isn't good.

As a software engineer juggling a hectic schedule, finding a TV series that can truly captivate my attention is a rare gem. Fauda, the Israeli thriller that has been making waves, managed to not only grab my attention but also keep me on the edge of my seat throughout its gripping narrative.

From the very first episode, Fauda thrusts viewers into the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, offering a nuanced perspective that goes beyond the headlines. The series, which I had the pleasure of managing between my coding sessions, boasts a relentless pace and a storyline that doesn't shy away from the complexities of the region.

One of the standout elements of Fauda is its character development. As someone who appreciates well-crafted narratives, I found myself invested in the lives of the characters, each with their own motives and struggles. Lior Raz, who plays the lead character Doron Kavillio, delivers a stellar performance that adds depth to the series.

The authenticity of Fauda is striking, from the realistic portrayal of military operations to the exploration of the personal toll such conflicts take on individuals. The creators have managed to create a series that feels both thrilling and authentic, offering a rare glimpse into the human side of the conflict.

Found this here: https://mustwatchtvseries.xyz/tv/1930/fauda

As a Linux enthusiast familiar with intricate systems, I appreciate the meticulous attention to detail in Fauda. The strategic and tactical aspects of the operations depicted in the series are well-researched and add an extra layer of credibility to the storyline.

While the series doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of the conflict, it also delves into the gray areas, questioning the morality and consequences of actions taken by both sides. Fauda succeeds in portraying the humanity behind the uniforms, making it a thought-provoking watch.

In conclusion, Fauda is not just a series; it's a masterfully crafted exploration of the human side of conflict. Whether you're a fan of intense thrillers, interested in geopolitical issues, or simply looking for a well-executed series to sink your teeth into, Fauda is a must-watch. It's a testament to the power of storytelling and its ability to bridge gaps and foster understanding.

This review will be from someone who doesn't remember a single thing about The Golden Compass (2007), and who didn't read the books. This series wasn't marketed like Watchmen, which requires previous knowledge from the universe it is set in. Therefore, it should stand on its own... and it does, even if with a few struggles along the way, especially at the beginning. I won't spoil anything that the trailers didn't show, so don't worry.

If there's one thing no one will complain about His Dark Materials debut season is its impeccable cast. Dafne Keen is a spot-on choice to interpret Lyra Belacqua. She has the innocence of such a young child, but also the determination and courage that the character needs her to show. She's definitely the one who has the responsibility to move the plot forward. Her journey is filled with obstacles, emotional conflicts, and tons of adventures elevated by the beautiful visual effects, which improve as the season approaches its ending. I loved her in Logan (2017), I love her here as well.

James McAvoy is one of my favorite actors working today, and if the world was fair, he would have a couple of Oscar nominations already. He doesn't have that much screentime as Lord Asriel (marketing move from HBO, using an acclaimed actor to bring in audiences), but he is essential in the first episode, where a lot of exposition has to be given to the viewers. What could have been an overwhelming pilot episode concerning the amount of information to be transmitted, it turns out to be a pretty good introduction to some concepts and rules of this show. However, don't be fooled by my previous words: Lord Asriel is a crucial character this season, and he will continue to be one.

The rest of the cast is terrific. Shout-out to Lin-Manuel Miranda (Lee Scoresby), who cracks a few well-earned (and necessary) jokes to lighten the sometimes too dramatic tone. Great voice work from everyone involved with the daemons. However, Ruth Wilson steals the spotlight from everyone, including McAvoy and Dafne, as Marisa Coulter. If she receives a nomination for her fantastic performance, I won't be surprised. Her eyes express so much, and her movements resemble the ones of her daemon in jaw-dropping fashion. Little details that some people might not even care about, but Ruth really commits 200% to her role.

Obviously, this being an HBO series, the production level is very high. Surprisingly, the visual effects don't start that well. The first episodes are packed with noticeable green-screen, mainly in wide shots of some locations. However, from the fourth episode on, it's like someone else stepped in, and the CGI profoundly improved overall. The daemons are consistently great throughout the whole season, but there's a certain restraint in clearly showing them during those first chapters. Once Lyra gets deep in her journey, the different landscapes and sets look stunning, accompanied by excellent cinematography. Finally, the bears are, as expected, visually incredible.

Lorne Balfe delivers a wonderful main theme, sure, but his score enriches the show in a way that I can't stop listening to it. It's mostly subtle, but when it needs to bring those emotional chills, it definitely carries the necessary epic chords and melodies. I've been a fan of his work lately, so congrats to him for yet another hit soundtrack.

Unfortunately, I do have some issues with this season. The biggest one is related to a massive subplot that I can't reveal or dive into too much. What I can write is that it feels so separated from the main story that it feels like a totally different series with different characters. I know it's going to reach a point where it does become extremely important, but this season... it didn't even end with a massive plot point, twist or cliffhanger. It's so detached from Lyra's world and her mission that it unbalances the series' pacing.

This last aspect is consequently very inconsistent. The season carries a slow pace that I genuinely enjoy when it helps develop its characters further. However, when it switches from the lead narrative to the before-mentioned side story, it's like adding an extra layer of ""slow"" to the already steady pace. It doesn't help with the entertainment value, and it doesn't efficiently expand the plot. I hope next season these two narratives can start converging in some way, something I expected before the debut season's finale.

In addition to this, the visual effects were not really there during the first episodes. It takes until the fourth episode to get into a real adventure, which can make some people give up before that. I don't recommend doing it. It might be a slow start, but once the main story finds its rhythm, there's no stopping it. Each episode gets better than the previous, culminating in a shocking finale packed with some of the best moments of the entire season.

All in all, His Dark Materials has the potential to become one of the biggest shows on HBO. If done right, it can really become the leader of the pack. It possesses a truly captivating and engaging story, filled with gorgeous visuals, even if these aren't that perfect during the first chapters. From the fabulous set design to Lorne Balfe's phenomenal score, all directors did a great job with Jack Thorne's writing. However, Thorne's attempt to balance the main narrative with a too distinct side story breaks the series momentum and keeps the pacing inconsistent. Fortunately, the outstanding cast lead by a great Dafne Keen and an even greater Ruth Wilson are able to carry the show to safe harbor. It's good so far, but I would wait until next season to find out if the alethiometer has the solution to this one's problems...

4553,His Dark Materials,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.886,"**SEASON ONE REVIEW:**

S1 of 'His Dark Materials' is enjoyable viewing. First and foremost, the special effects for this show are incredible. The animals and dæmons look insane, especially by television standards. That is the thing that I love most about this. The cinematography is also top notch.

Cast-wise it's good. It's easy to see that Dafne Keen (Lyra) has serious talent, she is impressive for the majority here - at a few moments her performance isn't perfect, e.g. when finding out something in episode two, but I wouldn't expect her to be, definitely the best actor on display and she'll only improve. You may think I'm forgetting or ignoring James McAvoy (Asriel). Of course he is 'the' star but he hardly features, he's just barely in three episodes. For when we do see him, he is - obviously - terrific.

Away from Keen and McAvoy, you also have Ruth Wilson (Marisa) and Anne-Marie Duff (Ma) involved - I've only recently become aware of those two, from 'Luther' and 'The Salisbury Poisonings' respectively, they are both good here. Elsewhere, James Cosmo (Farder), Lucian Msamati (John) and Lin-Manuel Miranda (Lee) are enjoyable in their roles. Helen McCrory (Stelmaria) is in there too, but I didn't notice her until typing this review to be honest.

I did find some of the pacing across the first four episodes rather off, there was a fair amount of times when I felt like it was dragging its heels. Thankfully, the second part of this eight-episode series is much better. The opening theme is superb, also. I look forward to catching season two.","Dafne Keen, Amir Wilson, Ruth Wilson, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Simone Kirby","* * season one review : * * s1 'his dark materials ' enjoyable view . first foremost , special effect show incredible . animals dæmons look insane , especially television standards . thing love . cinematography also top notch . cast-wise 's good .

4553,His Dark Materials,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.886,"**_Season 2_**

**Original Review
(based on the season's first five episodes handed to press)**

HBO is back with the show that was supposed to take over Game of Thrones' massive success. His Dark Materials' debut season was a good start (review here), but its complex, layered storylines didn't all mix up together that well. It's an extremely dense narrative, one that Jack Thorne (the sole writer of season one) had some trouble nailing it. Now, not only does he bring Francesca Gardiner, Sarah Quintrell, Namsi Khan, and Lydia Adetunji to help him co-write the episodes, but Francesca even wrote the entire fifth chapter. Last season also had five different directors, while this one has Jamie Childs and Leanne Welham in control of the whole season.

So, before I jump to the review itself, just a little clarification: this is indeed a *** spoiler-free review for season two, but it might address spoilers of the first season ***. I'm also trusting the official trailer for this season as a guideline to what is part of the viewers' general knowledge of the narrative that's going to be developed across the next seven episodes, including which actors/characters show up as well as the basic premise of each story. That said, my expectations were moderately high for the continuation of Lyra's adventure and her connection to the famous prophecy. I binged the first five episodes in one afternoon... what does this mean?

It means His Dark Materials' second season is incredibly captivating. Usually, I try to watch press releases in the same manner as the audience will once the show starts getting broadcasted, but time wasn't kind to me, so I found myself with the necessity of binging the episodes instead of watching one or two per day. This method didn't feel forced at all, much on the contrary. Every episode is either packed with action or impactful narrative decisions that keep moving the plot forward. With the exception of one seemingly irrelevant subplot (I'll get there), every character has an exciting storyline that affects the main narrative.

Contrary to the last season, where Lyra was pretty much the only character who controlled the show's pacing, this season gives other characters important things to do, especially Will Parry and a new character from the latter's world, Dr. Mary Malone (Simone Kirby). Will and Lyra inevitably cross paths and work together to find out what mysteries lie in the new world they travel to at the last season's finale. Their relationship goes through the necessary build-up and development, being the key ingredient of the season's success. As the protagonists, Dafne Keen and Amir Wilson share great chemistry, which is vital if the show wants the audience to feel their powerful bond.

Will's role is much more impactful this season, maybe even more than Lyra's. If the first season was a nice, slow introduction to what Philip Pullman created in his novel series, the second one is a beacon of new, relevant data not only about the characters but about the rules of the ""multiverse"". From traveling between worlds to a shocking mission involving an object as important as the Alethiometer, passing through the first appearance of John Parry (Andrew Scott) and Mrs. Coulter's relentless search for her daughter, I still found Dr. Mary Malone's arc to be the most significant subplot of the whole show.

As an engineer myself, science was and will always be an area of great interest. Simone Kirby is excellent in portraying the physicist. Her current academic research and her past connection to religion end up delivering a game-changing discovery. Despite the season's overall writing still being focused on unnecessary exposition and basic dialogues, the big moments are all nailed perfectly. Every episode is remarkably engaging, and all end in a way that leaves the viewer craving immediately for the next chapter. Action is always present, so expect a couple of nail-biting situations and surprising outcomes.

Regarding the cast, Dafne Keen clearly shows signs of improvement, even if she started filming the second season right after the first one ended. Just like Amir Wilson, both carry much more expressiveness and emotion now, but Amir still needs to up his game. Their interactions are entertaining, to say the least. Ruth Wilson was the standout performance of last season, and she continues to prove her undeniable talent as the menacing, scary Mrs. Coulter (who keeps me questioning her true intentions). Ariyon Bakare has more screentime as Lord Carlo Boreal, who brings a lot of trouble to our protagonists, contrary to Dr. Mary Malone, who helps Lyra (and the viewers) to understand why the show is called His Dark Materials, and much more.

These four characters are the wheels of this season, and most of each episode's runtime is spent with them. Their own storylines form the main narrative. However, I believe two other subplots can hurt the season if the last two episodes don't use them properly. One features Lee Scoresby (Lin-Manuel Miranda), who ends up joining with John Parry. Having hugely acclaimed actors in a television show is great to grab viewers, but it might be a misleading marketing scheme.

For example, James McAvoy only shows up in two episodes during the first season, and he's nowhere to be seen in this one (even though I do acknowledge that COVID-19 supposedly impacted a standalone episode featuring Lord Asriel that couldn't be filmed). A similar circumstance occurs with Lin-Manuel Miranda, who still has a relevant side story, but his screentime is lamentably short. The other subplot involves the witches and the Magisterium. Ruta Gedmintas is amazing as Serafina Pekkala, but this whole war drama with the Magisterium only serves as a filler story, at least for now. I didn't find this story enthralling compared to everything else going on, even though some of the best visuals and cinematography of the entire show are demonstrated here.

Technically, HBO rarely disappoints, and the production crew is packed with immensely skilled people. Joel Devlin and David Higgs are responsible for the gorgeous cinematography, offering a sort of cinematic atmosphere distinct from other TV shows. Lorne Balfe's score remains remarkably addictive, not due to overwhelming music but due to its subtlety throughout the entire series. It's also seamlessly edited by everyone involved in this task. Jamie Childs and Leanne Welham clearly worked together to make this season look consistent throughout every episode, but I still believe the pacing needs better control (if last season was a tad slow, the second one might be a bit rushed).

All in all, His Dark Materials returns with a much more captivating and entertaining second season. Boasting impressive visuals, wonderful cinematography, and an exceptional score, Dafne Keen and Amir Wilson carry the main narrative through non-stop, surprisingly vicious action and shocking story developments as the charming protagonists, Lyra and Will, respectively. Their relationship is steadily and cleverly developed, also working as a STOP sign to the occasionally rushed pacing. Ruth Wilson continues to deliver the most outstanding performance of all, but Dr. Mary Malone steals the spotlight, becoming one of the most interesting characters in the show due to her crucial storyline, which delivers some jaw-dropping revelations. Except for a subplot involving the witches and the Magisterium, every episode moves surprisingly well through impactful narrative decisions and eventful sequences. Hugely acclaimed actors like James McAvoy, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Andrew Scott rarely show up during these first five episodes (or don't show up at all), but the last two still share an exciting story that could have a major impact on the season's final two chapters. A final praise to the production's (brilliant) decisions of adding four more writers besides Jack Thorne, and choosing only two directors to command the entire season. If season one didn't fully convince you, season two will most definitely do the job.

**Final Thoughts
(based on the remaining episodes and the entire season)**

The remaining two episodes are nothing short of shocking. His Dark Materials ends its second season with narrative and character decisions that will definitely generate divisive opinions. No one knew about the series ending on its third season at the time of viewing, so I reacted to certain choices heavily questioning the real reasons behind them since most felt extremely rushed, out of nowhere, and surprisingly underwhelming. Now, knowing that there's only one more season, I'm struggling between considering the season finale disappointing or reasonably decent, having in mind the series status.

It's a shame that such compelling world-building has to end so soon. This series could easily create new stories to last years. Possessing a talented cast and gorgeous visuals, it could really become one of HBO's biggest shows. However, looking at it now, casting James McAvoy, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and even Andrew Scott was nothing more than a marketing scheme to get more viewers. Entering a third and final season, barely being able to see these actors, mainly McAvoy, is a profound letdown, and the latest episodes don’t solve the issue.

It’s still a step-up from the debut season, and the standalone episode starring Lord Asriel that the global pandemic “stole” would surely improve the missing pieces of storytelling. So, taking everything into account, I still feel quite satisfied with how Jack Thorne and his fellow co-writers connected the several storylines. Let us all hope for an outstanding ending!

From reading the synopsis and watching its earlier parts, we got to know what the female was going through and why she moved away from the city. Clearly, she had issues she needed to work on, however, despite her issues with trusting people and being hurt by others, her romance went against her character. She had a very easy and quick romance with minimum communication for a drama that meant to be driven by dialogue. She started a relationship in a short period of time before scratching the surface of her issues. It would've been much better to replace the romance with the people of her town, it would have had created a much better environment to work on her issues. In fact, the resolution and progress on her issues ended up being half-hearted, not much was accomplished by the end. On another note, I didn't like that the characters past stories were based in high-school, there was a gap that couldn't be translated to their adulthood life.

SAS: Rogue Hero's, mixes revisionist history, with a view of war as a ""jolly old adventure"" it never was and never will be. 

Its light, jaunty, almost flippant tones and its odd contempt for Australian's soldiers, who Rommel said he'd want at his side were he to ever invade hell, is both irritating and I feel, more than a little insulting.The reference to Commonwealth troops, who died in droves, as ""colonials"", doesn't help either. 

Put bluntly, this thing reeks of longing for a revival of the elitist  British empire, with its over zealous desire to glorify and worship war, in the worst way possible. That is, by treating it as something everyday and honourable, rather than something alien and abhorrent. 

The only discernible upside here is quality acting and polished sets. Certainly the BBC never fails in this department.

4600,One Piece,"Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.2,"An Absolute Trainwreck: One Piece (Live Action) Deserves to Sink to the Bottom of the Ocean

I cannot express just how much of a colossal failure the live-action adaptation of ""One Piece"" is. It's as if the creators set out to destroy everything that made the original series a beloved masterpiece.

First and foremost, the casting is abysmal. The characters we know and love from the manga and anime are portrayed by actors who seem completely disinterested and utterly incapable of capturing the essence of their respective roles. Luffy is supposed to be a charismatic and energetic pirate, but the actor chosen to play him brings nothing but wooden expressions and lacklustre acting. It's painful to watch.

The costumes and makeup are equally atrocious. The characters look like they're wearing cheap Halloween costumes, and the make-up is so overdone that it's almost comical. It's clear that the production team had no respect for the source material or its dedicated fanbase.

The special effects are laughably bad. The CGI used to bring the Devil Fruits to life is cringe-worthy, and the action sequences are poorly choreographed and lack any sense of excitement or tension. Even the ship, the Going Merry, looks like it was made out of cardboard and painted with a preschooler's art supplies.

The storyline is an absolute mess. The pacing is all over the place, with major plot points rushed through and insignificant filler scenes dragged out for what feels like an eternity. It's as if the writers had no understanding of what made the original story so engaging and decided to throw in random elements to see what sticks.

But perhaps the most unforgivable sin of this live-action adaptation is how it completely disregards the heart and soul of ""One Piece."" The series is known for its deep and meaningful themes of friendship, freedom, and adventure, but this adaptation reduces it to a mindless, soulless spectacle that is devoid of any substance or emotion.

In short, ""One Piece"" (Live Action) is an absolute disaster that should never have seen the light of day. It's an insult to the original series and its dedicated fanbase, and it's a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved anime and manga into live-action. Save yourself the agony and skip this travesty of a show.","Iñaki Godoy, Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Jacob Gibson, Vincent Regan","absolute trainwreck : one piece ( live action ) deserve sink bottom ocean express much colossal failure live-action adaptation `` one piece '' .

4600,One Piece,"Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.2,"As a complete anime novice, approaching ""One Piece"" (2023) was a leap of faith. I'm accustomed to live-action, grounded narratives, not cartoonish worlds with fantastical elements. But driven by a desire to explore the world of anime, I dove in headfirst, and to my surprise, was swept away by the captivating story and vibrant characters.

The series centers around Monkey D. Luffy, a cheerful and energetic pirate captain with a rubber body. Honestly, Luffy's infectious enthusiasm is what initially drew me in. His genuine spirit and boundless optimism were refreshing, and I found myself becoming just as energized after each episode. He reminded me to approach the world with a sense of fun and wonder, a quality I deeply appreciate.

Beyond Luffy, the entire cast is a colorful tapestry of unique and memorable characters. The plot itself is a thrilling adventure, keeping me hooked from beginning to end.

What truly blew me away was the level of imagination and creativity woven into the story. The author's wild and refreshing fantasies, like a restaurant in the middle of the ocean or a female pirate with incredible powers, opened my mind to possibilities I never considered. It challenged my perception of the world, reminding me that reality can be far more fantastical than I initially imagined.

I've heard this type of imaginative storytelling is a staple of the anime genre, and I must say, I'm completely hooked. While the traditional anime style didn't quite resonate with me, this live-action adaptation was a perfect entry point. It managed to capture the spirit of the source material without sacrificing its visual appeal or the depth of its characters.

""One Piece"" is a reminder that sometimes, the best stories are the ones that embrace the extraordinary. It's an adventure, a comedy, and a heartwarming tale all rolled into one, and I can't wait to see what Luffy and his crew get up to next. This series has not only introduced me to the world of anime, but it's also reignited my sense of wonder and joy in storytelling.","Iñaki Godoy, Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Jacob Gibson, Vincent Regan","complete anime novice , approach `` one piece '' ( 2023 ) leap faith .

4665,Star Trek: Lower Decks,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Animation, Comedy",7.6,"**It's a different Star Trek, but it's finally Star Trek**

When Lower Decks first came out, I gave it a bad review and now I would like to make up for that. It's not that I disagree with my earlier reviews, they were accurate regarding the episodes back then. But I do feel that since then and especially now in Season 3 they have become so much more than just another animated sitcom or just another Star Trek parody. NOW it finally starts to feel like actual Star Trek, which is the highest praise a Trekkie can give - especially considering that there is so much ""NuTrek"" around now, yet none of the other shows - including and especially even the live action shows - truly feel like Star Trek. Well, okay, Strange New Worlds isn't half bad either, but that's also because I can't wait for their crossover with this show!

The problem was that initially, me and many other fans couldn't understand how an over the top animated parody, could be more like Star Trek than say that other show about vineyards. But it truly is and it's more than just a parody. Roddenberry described Star Trek as ""Guliver's Travels in space"". And of course Guliver's Travels has always been a satire and a parody - though be it a parody of the society of its time. And of course if you criticize your contemporary society, you need to figure out some way to get around censorship. And of course the classic trick is to just pretend that it's not talking about our present society, but about some remote island/planet that just so happens to look exactly like the contemporary society of the author. But thanks to both Jonathan and Gene, that trick is now so old and so well known, that no studio executive in the world is going to be fooled by it anymore, which is exactly the reason why the other NuTrek shows don't feel like Star Trek anymore.

Lower Decks on the other hand uses the fact that as an animated parody it's prone to not be taken as serious, and so it's easier for them to fly under the radar and hide their criticism about contemporary issues (even if it's mainly criticism of NuTrek itself) among a myriad of jokes, Easter eggs and 4th wall breaks. It's literally ""lower decks"" and lower decks won't stand out (among the many other shows with a higher budget and bigger stars) and in fact they are counting on that and that's why once I realized that, I now absolutely love and adore them. Which explains why initially they did more of a parody, but starting with this episode and this season, they increasingly drop the disguise and have some real stories and messages underneath all the overt silliness.","Tawny Newsome, Jack Quaid, Noël Wells, Eugene Cordero, Dawnn Lewis","* * 's different star trek , 's finally star trek * * lower deck first come , give bad review would like make .

It's supposed to be a slow-burn, atmospheric mystery thriller.

It is slow, alright; and there is some mystery, albeit not intriguing. Set design, camera, lighting, and fx get the atmospheric bit done; sound and music are well selected, too. Costume is OK, acting good.

We're on water, and the (alchemist) earth symbol is everywhere. Well, that's a mystery indeed.

Where it starts to go wrong is the artificial slowness; characters which against all likelihood do not state at least the obvious, do not talk to each other where it would make sense. So we miss out on character drawing, character development, and sanity amidst the fog. For fog abounds here, metaphorically and visually. But that does not help the story.

Characters are outside the usual roster, but they are neither well written nor developing. Some complain about ""woke propaganda""; well, there is some preachy elements and annoying bits, but not as bad as in certain other ""originals"". 

The multi-language thing however works very well, from my point of view.

The core issue is and remains the script: this is badly written.
The direction stretches the little content it finds over way too many hours. And all the mysteries turn out to be... bollocks. Distractions.

Thank you to the men and wymin writers and directors for offering us this elegant yet down-to-Earth splendor.  Il Paradiso delle Signore is one of my most loved tv shows, ever.

Prima, we are introduced to the beautiful and frustrated Teresa, brilliantly portrayed by Giusy Buscemi.  I admire that Teresa is an independent thinker and doer; cares about the world around her; and has a keen business sense (wish shi started her own business).  Her Life is exciting but I think shi deserved a better man (Seasons 1 & 2).

Secondo, we are introduced to the quiet and determined Pietro Mori (Giuseppe Zeno).  Though he struggles to severe his relationship with the past; and to achieve the type of success he dreams, I can relate to and admire him.  Can you imagine, a low-income womin in America relating to a successful man in Italy, of the 1950s no less?  Mr. Mori also cares about the world around him; is a focused professional; respects his staff with kindness and by trusting their professional instincts; and seeks and gains the success of which I daydream all the time.

Terzo, we have the handsome, creative, and well-dressed Vittorio Conti (Alessandro Tersigni)!  As Mr. Mori’s Chief Advertising Officer, Vittorio passionately helps steer Mr. Mori’s business, until he doesn’t (good for him).  He is joyful, fun, and an independent thinker and doer himself.

The drama itself was embarrassingly dry and lacked appealing elements. A story not worth telling. I'm not sure about the historical accuracy but they did a poor job with storytelling regardless.

This is partly because there are only two seasons, but mostly because I enjoy cyberpunk, sci-fi, the little details I pick up each time I watch, stories that tackle the human condition, and the overall idea behind the plot.

This will be by no means an in-depth review, even after years of watching it and its release, but if you are into any of my previously mentioned reasons for rewatching this so many times, you will enjoy the majority of season one.

And if you're a hopeless romantic, you'll also enjoy most of season two. 

You may see comments/reviews around the web of people hating Season 2 due to inconsistencies in the main character's behaviour. But after watching this series several times, I can say without a doubt that the character's personality was set up to become a hopeless romantic even from Season 1. Even one of the theme songs is hopelessly romantic. And finally, there is a time jump of 30 years between Seasons 1 and 2 - a person's character/mannerisms/moral code/etc. can change in 30 years, especially when they have been failing for 30 years.

4821,Black Lightning,"Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.0,"I suppose that the best part of Black Lightening is that, from time to time, it throws some serious 1970s Funk at you, and that is honestly about the coolest thing that you can do with a show...or movie...or just in general. And it beats the heck out of modern music.

However, more so than any of the other Super Hero shows on the CW, it suffers HEAVILY under the mark of the CW. Just when you think it's going to take a good turn, the CW teenage focused melodrama is injected into it and takes the wind out of it's sails.

It would be forgivable if it happened once, but it seems to get neutered by the CW every time it takes what promises to be heading into a good direction. It could have dealt with race relations in an entertaining and dramatic manner...but then it turns into a CW manner and it turns into a melodrama.

It could have dealt with death is an entertaining, gripping, and dramatic way...and then abruptly turns to CW melodrama.

And those are just a couple of examples. it all adds up...and even though I can honestly say that it does deserve more than 1 star...the CW robbed it of it's potential too many times to sit down and watch.

Its like the CW is yelling ""STOP! you're about to get gripping and realistic, remember your audience is a high school clique!""

I know that doesn't inspire more to view it, but it is the truth for now.  

As it stands (for me) the show is dragging a bit.  It's a little too pragmatic in that the series is not doing much to improve the MC's character.  He's changing but like I've mentioned, the show is doing it slowly.  Also his personality is a bit advanced for his age.  He thinks strategically, which would not be bad IF he were older.  I did not know he was supposed to be in the 9th grade.  That makes him, at his oldest, maybe 15.  Still his mode of thinking does not fit that narrative.  And that is a bit off-putting.

4854,Interior Chinatown,"Drama, Crime, Comedy",7.3,"**_Interior Chinatown_: A Sharp Satire That Challenges Stereotypes and Forces Self-Reflection**

_Interior Chinatown_ is a brilliant yet understated reflection of the world—a mirror that exposes how society often judges people by their covers. The show captures this poignantly with the scene where Willis Wu can’t get into the police precinct until he proves his worth by delivering food. It’s a powerful metaphor: sometimes, if you don’t fit the mold, you have to prove your value in the most degrading or unexpected ways just to get a foot in the door. The locked precinct doors represent barriers faced by those who don’t match the “majority’s” idea of what’s acceptable or valuable.

While the series centers on the Asian and Pacific Islander (API) community and the stereotypical roles Hollywood has long relegated them to—background extras, kung fu fighters—it forces viewers to confront bigger questions. It makes you ask: **Am I complicit in perpetuating these stereotypes? Am I limiting others—or even myself—by what I assume is their worth?** It’s not just about API representation; it’s about how society as a whole undervalues anyone who doesn’t fit neatly into its preferred narrative.

The show can feel confusing if you don’t grasp its satirical lens upfront. But for me, knowing the context of Charles Yu’s original book helped it click. The production team does an incredible job balancing satire with sincerity, blurring the line between real life and the exaggerated Hollywood “procedural” format. They cleverly use contrasting visuals and distinct camera work to draw you into different headspaces—Hollywood’s glossy expectations versus the grittier reality of life.

Chloe Bennet’s involvement (real name Chloe Wang) ties into the show’s themes on a deeply personal level. She famously changed her last name to navigate Hollywood, caught in the impossible middle ground of not being “Asian enough” or “white enough” for casting directors. It’s a decision that sparks debate—was it an act of survival, assimilation, or betrayal? But for Bennett, it was about carving a space for herself to pursue her dreams.

This theme echoes in one of the show’s most poignant scenes, where Lana is told, “You will never completely understand. You’re mixed.” It’s a crushing acknowledgment of the barriers that persist, even when you’re trying to bridge divides. Lana’s story highlights how identity can be both a strength and an obstacle, and the line serves as a painful reminder of the walls society creates—externally and internally.

_Interior Chinatown_ doesn’t just ask us to look at the system; it forces us to examine ourselves. Whether it’s Willis Wu at the precinct door or Lana trying to connect in a world that sees her as neither this nor that, the show unflinchingly portrays the struggle to belong. And as viewers, it challenges us to question our role in those struggles: Are we helping to dismantle the barriers, or are we quietly reinforcing them?","Jimmy O.

4895,Babylon Berlin,"Drama, Crime, Mystery",7.7,"Set in Germany's Weimar Republic in the late 1920s Babylon Berlin is a brilliant production, a welcome surprise for American television. The sets are fantastic and the actors are brilliant. Now it is excellently dubbed in English, and it is dubbed so well I thought at first it was filmed in English to begin with. I don't know what the budget is for this series, but I am very impressed with this show. 

Liv Lisa Fries plays Charlotte Ritter, a plucky young lady working odd jobs, including piece work for the police department, to support her extended family. She is plucky, smart, and willing to do whatever she can to provide for her little sister,  elderly mother and grandfather (and elderly sister and her deadbeat husband).  Volcher Bruch plays Detective Gereon Rath from Cologne, on special assignment in Berlin. Slowly we discern, over the first several episodes what that assignment is, and later how it relates to a threat to the German government. 

Germany was wracked with unbelievable poverty and runaway inflation during this time period. There was a huge contrast between those who still have wealth and the majority of the people. We see this as hoards of young ladies daily begged for short term clerical jobs, or any kind of work. Many turned to prostitution to survive. Not surprisingly the communists took advantage of these conditions to recruit people to their cause, and we see this activity in Berlin. 

I am very impressed with this show. I hope it continues for many more seasons.","Volker Bruch, Liv Lisa Fries, Lars Eidinger, Benno Fürmann, Ronald Zehrfeld","set germany 's weimar republic late 1920s babylon berlin brilliant production , welcome surprise american television . set fantastic actors brilliant . excellently dub english , dub well think first film english begin . n't know budget series , impress show . liv lisa fry play charlotte ritter , plucky young lady work odd job , include piece work police department , support extend family . plucky , smart , will whatever provide little sister , elderly mother grandfather ( elderly sister deadbeat husband ) . volcher bruch play detective gereon rath cologne , special assignment berlin . slowly discern , first several episodes assignment , later relate threat german government . germany wrack unbelievable poverty runaway inflation time period . huge contrast still wealth majority people . see hoard young ladies daily beg short term clerical job , kind work . many turn prostitution survive . surprisingly communists take advantage condition recruit people cause , see activity berlin . impress show . hope continue many season .",1,1
4895,Babylon Berlin,"Drama, Crime, Mystery",7.7,"An atmosphere of German 20's chic permeates Babylon Berlin. Its a detective tale at its heart that initially captures the vibe of a decade that celebrated a newfound carefree freedom. A freedom that was not repeated until the 1960's.

There's a real sense of flamboyance and decadence, that's colourful., celebratory and sexually promiscuous. Overlapping this is a delicately constructed story line that mixes a detective tale, with evolving political intrigue and cultism/militarism. The latter the earliest murmurs of an inflexible, embryonic nationalism, which will usher in an era of Nazism, which, in many respects, is very much, at odds, with 1920's Berlin.

Rounding out this series is well crafted narrative, sensational sets and deeply human characterisations. The key protagonists in Babylon Berlin are flawed. There are no hero's, simply people going about their lives. This series does not shy away from the confusion and mess that make up much of peoples lives. It embraces it, in a simple, honest way, that makes this series utterly immersive.

There are two versions of this series I'm aware of. One is dubbed and the other uses subs. My advice go for the subs version. Somehow something of the essence of the series is lost with the rather flat, voice overs.

The latest season in the series, four, is set at the beginning of the 1930's, heading into a decade of economic and social decline and the emergence of   Nazi-ism.

The casting is good. The acting is smooth. The designs are beautiful, and I guess the merit goes to the artist that drew the comics.

Neil Gaiman might be a good writer, but as with American Gods, the moment he gets involved with live-action adaptations, the quality apparently goes out the window. Kudos to him for defending the casting choices though.

A few episodes from season 1 stand out, specifically episodes 1, 4, and 6. The rest are fine but just not worth it. The mid-season climax leaves a lot to be desired and apparently is so insignificant that it has no lasting impact on the world and no one bothers to mention it again. By the end I had lost so much interest in it that I didn't even bother to return for the bonus episode, and it allegedly has a cat. I love cats.

4957,Moon Knight,"Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery",7.7,"_Moon Knight_ is like nothing Marvel’s done before—and I’m all in for the ride! The series throws out the traditional superhero playbook and gives us something gritty, weird, and seriously fun. If you thought _WandaVision_ was trippy, get ready, because _Moon Knight_ cranks up the surrealism even more. With a mashup of Egyptian mythology, action, and psychological horror, this show keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Oscar Isaac? Absolutely killing it. Watching him flip between the nervous, quirky Steven Grant and the hard-edged Marc Spector is a masterclass. One moment he’s fumbling through life with that British accent (which, yeah, feels a bit bonkers but endearing), and the next, he’s this tough mercenary wielding ancient powers. Isaac’s performance is the glue that holds everything together, especially when the pacing gets rocky. And let’s not forget that Isaac is technically juggling three characters. Yes, the third alter, Jake Lockley, makes a chilling appearance—teasing a darker layer to this already complex character.

The plot itself is simple on the surface—Steven and Marc’s tangled lives collide as they investigate Egyptian gods and a looming apocalyptic threat—but that’s where the simplicity ends. _Moon Knight_ thrives on chaos. Its unpolished, unpredictable narrative makes every episode feel like an adventure through Steven and Marc’s fractured minds. There are some wild tonal shifts, and sure, not all of them land perfectly, but that’s part of the charm. It’s gritty, it’s suspenseful, and there’s a raw energy here that you don’t see in every Marvel series.

Ethan Hawke as Arthur Harrow is a whole vibe. He brings this sinister, almost cult-leader energy that keeps you guessing. And May Calamawy? She holds her own as Layla, stepping into the spotlight as the Scarlet Scarab by the end of the season. Her action scenes and the dynamic between her and Marc/Steven elevate the show even further.

The pacing? Yeah, it can be a slow burn, especially early on. The show takes its time setting up Steven’s confusion before really diving into the action, and that might turn some people off. But trust me—stick with it. Once you’re through those first few episodes, _Moon Knight_ finds its groove. And while the show doesn’t fully escape the Orientalist undertones of the original comics, the direction from Mohamed Diab keeps the focus on character and chaos, giving us a visually stunning experience.

Speaking of visuals, the _Moon Knight_ suit is incredible, and the action sequences—especially those where Marc or Steven summons the suit—are sleek and satisfying. However, the creatures and gods sometimes feel underused, lurking more in the shadows than in full focus. But that eerie, horror-inspired edge works in the show’s favor, keeping things unpredictable.

At its core, _Moon Knight_ is a character study wrapped in mythological madness. It’s not trying to tie itself too tightly to the MCU, and that’s what makes it so refreshing. There’s a freedom here that lets the show explore mental health, trauma, and ancient power in ways Marvel hasn’t touched on before. Plus, the internal tug-of-war between Marc and Steven adds depth that keeps you emotionally invested.

Ultimately, _Moon Knight_ isn’t perfect, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s a chaotic, daring, and entertaining leap into new territory for the MCU. With Isaac’s powerhouse performance, strong supporting cast, and a story that’s just wild enough to work, this is one Marvel series you don’t want to miss.","Oscar Isaac, Ethan Hawke, May Calamawy, Ann Akinjirin, David Ganly","_moon knight_ like nothing marvel ’ do before—and ’ ride ! series throw traditional superhero playbook give us something gritty , weird , seriously fun . think _wandavision_ trippy , get ready , _moon knight_ crank surrealism even . mashup egyptian mythology , action , psychological horror , show keep edge seat . oscar isaac ? absolutely kill . watch flip nervous , quirky steven grant hard-edged marc spector masterclass . one moment ’ fumble life british accent ( , yeah , feel bite bonkers endear ) , next , ’ tough mercenary wield ancient power . isaac ’ performance glue hold everything together , especially pace get rocky . let ’ forget isaac technically juggle three character . yes , third alter , jake lockley , make chill appearance—teasing darker layer already complex character . plot simple surface—steven marc ’ tangle live collide investigate egyptian gods loom apocalyptic threat—but ’ simplicity end . _moon knight_ thrive chaos . unpolished , unpredictable narrative make every episode feel like adventure steven marc ’ fracture mind . wild tonal shift , sure , land perfectly , ’ part charm . ’ gritty , ’ suspenseful , ’ raw energy ’ see every marvel series . ethan hawke arthur harrow whole vibe . bring sinister , almost cult-leader energy keep guess . may calamawy ? hold layla , step spotlight scarlet scarab end season . action scenes dynamic marc/steven elevate show even . pace ? yeah , slow burn , especially early . show take time set steven ’ confusion really dive action , might turn people . trust me—stick . ’ first episodes , _moon knight_ find groove . show ’ fully escape orientalist undertones original comics , direction mohamed diab keep focus character chaos , give us visually stun experience . speak visuals , _moon knight_ suit incredible , action sequences—especially marc steven summon suit—are sleek satisfy . however , creatures gods sometimes feel underused , lurk shadow full focus . eerie , horror-inspired edge work show ’ favor , keep things unpredictable . core , _moon knight_ character study wrap mythological madness . ’ try tie tightly mcu , ’ make refresh . ’ freedom let show explore mental health , trauma , ancient power ways marvel ’ touch . plus , internal tug-of-war marc steven add depth keep emotionally invest . ultimately , _moon knight_ ’ perfect , ’ need . ’ chaotic , dare , entertain leap new territory mcu . isaac ’ powerhouse performance , strong support cast , story ’ wild enough work , one marvel series ’ want miss .",1,1

The drama was the apotheosis of human failure, an insidious plague upon the landscape of television, a wretched abomination birthed from the depths of creative bankruptcy and soulless commercialism, a festering wound that infects the very essence of storytelling with its repulsive presence. Its premise was a nauseating blend of techno-narcissism and romantic idiocy, an affront to the intelligence of any sentient being unfortunate enough to bear witness to its abomination, a grotesque mutation of what once passed for entertainment. Characters were grotesque caricatures of humanity, mere vessels for the perpetuation of vapid romantic fantasies and insipid melodrama and their interactions were a cacophony of soulless platitudes and contrived emotional manipulation, each scene got progressively worse than the last. The writing was an insult to the very concept of coherent narrative structure, a labyrinth of a garbled mess and mind numbingly banal dialogue that defies comprehension. In fact, this drama wasn't just bad television, it was an abomination of the highest order, a blight upon the collective consciousness of humanity and the very fabric of reality itself that must be expunged from existence with extreme prejudice.

The writing and production let it down.  The cast are strong enough to carry it, Purnell's a strong lead...
It's supposed to be funny, but slides by that into farce and we're not living in the 80s or 90s anymore and farce feels very tired for an audience with even the most basic tv-literacy.  The comedic moments mostly fall flat, but the flatness of them is compounded by the cliffhangers.
You've seen this is pretty much every lazy, mainstream tv-show.  This certainly isn't The Wire or The Sopranos, both shows that managed to have (very) funny moments that didn't detract from the show itself.  If this had 10 episodes instead of 6 and didn't adhere so strongly to a formula it would be better.
The other problem is SKY Atlantic, so a co-production maybe, a pretty unambitious one at that, there's no visual flair to this, it's just drab rainy England, drab rainy pubs, clubs, houses and that's fine, that's England, but damn drag some of that Arts degree out of yourself and do something interesting with the camera, there's just no ambition to it on a visual basis, nothing offensive, just very workman-like.
Soundtrack's ok - but let's face it, even the Katy Perry track can't have been expensive in this day and age and the rest of it is about as contemporary - about 5 years off and giving it a Skins vibe, with an over reliance on drab singer/acoustic(boring) cover of actual famous song, seemingly inoffensive, unless you actually like music.

5066,God'S Quiz,"Mystery, Crime",5.6,"God's Quiz in general was more mystery/thriller/investigation than medical. The main lead, who's a medical examiner, was doing more field detective work and following suspects than the real detectives. I didn't like how they setup the main lead character, he's genius because of a drug experiment in his childhood and this led to all kinds of made up scenarios stemming from his condition across different seasons. Every season, they twisted it in a different way which took away from having a consistent character. It's the eternal problem of any unplanned sequel seasons in a series. Which imposes an impossible task for any multi-seasons writers.

Production: Seasons 1 to 4 were molded under the same OCN early days template, which all shared the same level of underwhelming production value. Soundtracks during season 1 & 2 were super generic stock background noise, only with season 3 they started to include music. Although season 3 was filmed better but had a much worse audio production in general. Season 4 was a noticeable improvement in production but it still wasn't quite there yet. This is all in comparison to regular shows that were released around early 2010s. On the other hand, season 5 brought with it a proper production and other improvements. 

Characters: The dynamic and chemistry of the entire group during season 1 was abysmal, overacting from everyone, forced unnatural interactions and none of them clicked. Season 2 somewhat got better in that regard, you can notice that they got more relaxed but still not quite there yet. The ending scene of season 2 while the ML is kissing, his lips were shivering like crazy. It must have been super awkward to the point that they couldn't afford to have another take. Season 3 took a step backward with its changed cast. Detective Bae Tae Shik brought an awful dynamic to the table. Him and main lead didn't click together and created a bad on screen combination. It's probably why the writer didn't write him in for later seasons. The same can be said about other characters associated with Bae Tae Shik. The relationship and attempted romance between ML and Kyung Hee during season 1 & 2 was plain awful to watch. Only in season 4 it got reasonably better and season 5 fixed this issue completely by dropping the childish romantic tension and having them behave like adults. I liked seeing Kim Jae Won as a flashy villain in season 5, it was fun watching a different type of role from him. 

Story: The structure of every season consisted of having a few cases then dedicate the last 3 episodes to the final case which had a personal connection with the characters. These last cases in every season were quite problematic for a variety of reasons, only season 5 had a better implementation despite its weak climax. More highlight across the seasons, the last episode of season 3 was the worst out of the entire series. The cloning plot in season 4 was super trashy and tacky, despite having an obvious playing room to take it into very interesting directions. The ending of season 4 featured another super weird and awkward kiss. The entire thing about AI in season 5 was really janky and a big stretch for the viewers to accept. In general, the cases were a mixed bag in every season, some were decent and interesting while others were boring, flawed or being stretched thin. However, season 3 featured mostly bad cases in addition to the handful of other problems which made season 3 to be the worst one in general. 

The series as a whole was alright with a lot of ups and downs. It had a good concept with a varied degrees of execution. Although season 5 is the best one but it wouldn't have been that good as a stand alone drama without the accumulation of these characters journey. The ending of season 5 with both leads walking outside was very nicely done.

5068,3 Body Problem,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery, Drama",7.507,"""The Three-Body Problem"" (2024) isn't just a science fiction film; it's a captivating journey into the vastness of space, the complexities of human nature, and the profound mysteries of the universe. This film, based on the acclaimed novel by Cixin Liu, stands as a towering achievement in the genre, surpassing any other space exploration film released in recent years.

As a space science enthusiast, I was utterly enthralled by the film's meticulous attention to scientific detail. While some scenes might initially seem confusing, they are grounded in solid scientific principles. The film masterfully weaves together concepts like the ""three-body problem"" in celestial mechanics, the challenges of interstellar travel, and the potential for alien life, creating a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.

The film's brilliance lies in its ability to explore the full spectrum of human nature. From the darkest depths of cruelty and ambition to the most profound acts of kindness and selflessness, ""The Three-Body Problem"" paints a realistic portrait of humanity's response to the extraordinary. The film's central conflict, a clash between Earth and an alien civilization, serves as a powerful metaphor for the challenges and opportunities that arise when different cultures and perspectives collide.

The film's narrative is a testament to the genius of Cixin Liu's original work. The concept of an alien civilization existing in a three-body system, facing constant chaos and instability, is both scientifically fascinating and deeply philosophical. The film masterfully translates this concept onto the screen, creating a world that is both alien and strangely familiar.

The film's exploration of physics is particularly noteworthy. It delves into complex concepts like dark matter and the nature of time, making them accessible to a wider audience. While some viewers might find these concepts challenging, the film's visual storytelling and clear explanations make them engaging and thought-provoking.

""The Three-Body Problem"" is a rare gem in the world of science fiction. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, prompting you to ponder the universe's mysteries and our place within it. It's a must-watch for anyone who seeks a cinematic experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally profound. This film is a testament to the power of science fiction to inspire, challenge, and ultimately, connect us to the vastness of the cosmos.","Jovan Adepo, Rosalind Chao, Liam Cunningham, Eiza González, Jess Hong","`` three-body problem '' ( 2024 ) n't science fiction film ; 's captivate journey vastness space , complexities human nature , profound mysteries universe . film , base acclaim novel cixin liu , stand tower achievement genre , surpass space exploration film release recent years . space science enthusiast , utterly enthral film 's meticulous attention scientific detail . scenes might initially seem confuse , ground solid scientific principles . film masterfully weave together concepts like `` three-body problem '' celestial mechanics , challenge interstellar travel , potential alien life , create narrative intellectually stimulate emotionally resonant . film 's brilliance lie ability explore full spectrum human nature . darkest depths cruelty ambition profound act kindness selflessness , `` three-body problem '' paint realistic portrait humanity 's response extraordinary . film 's central conflict , clash earth alien civilization , serve powerful metaphor challenge opportunities arise different culture perspectives collide . film 's narrative testament genius cixin liu 's original work . concept alien civilization exist three-body system , face constant chaos instability , scientifically fascinate deeply philosophical . film masterfully translate concept onto screen , create world alien strangely familiar . film 's exploration physics particularly noteworthy . delve complex concepts like dark matter nature time , make accessible wider audience . viewers might find concepts challenge , film 's visual storytelling clear explanations make engage thought-provoking . `` three-body problem '' rare gem world science fiction .

I am starting to get more into anime as a genre, and I decided to watch this since my Instagram feed was recommending me posts with this anime on it. So I got a Crunchyroll subscription to see, and I would say it was a good idea.

I am finding myself to like anime more and I watch more of it cause I feel like a lot of the creators behind them have very strong material to work with or they are just very good at what they do coming up with a story and executing it well. And along with that, I think I am really enjoying these little slices of life stories that are set in an everyday world and has a story of characters interacting and getting to know each other. 

What I like most about this series is the characters. I think Gojo and Kitagawa have a really strong character from the start and their characteristics are consistent throughout. The audience is getting to know them as the characters get to know each other. You will remember the way they talk, act, and think. Personally, I think characters are the most important part of any story, movie, or TV show. And this show had some really memorable ones that kept me invested. I am also surprised how interesting I found the show for even things that you think wouldn't be, like when characters talk about their interests in detail. Speaking of, I commend the writers for actually researching about the stuff their characters are interested in because it makes the show feel more alive and authentic. I think overall, while the show isn't perfect, it was better than I anticipated and I really recommend this show for those who think they might have even remote interest.

I really appreciated how it focuses on the individuals with a reasonable scoop while taking into consideration their surrounding rather than throwing in mindless connections to make the story more grand without relevant purpose such as wars/nations/kingdoms/factions. Although it started to lean a little bit into the other side towards the end, unfortunately, this is the fault of its runtime. Which brings me to my next point, the drama is definitely too long for its content and it would benefit greatly if it were to be condensed down to ~25 episodes, it would make a much more compelling package. Because of this, the drama had a serious issue with flashbacks. There was a one piece of dialogue that was repeated almost every other episode for its entire runtime, a bit too much! I liked the first 2/3 more than the last 1/3, things were changing at an unreasonable pace as we were approaching the end, you may say it was rushed. The last ~10 episodes were full of rapid changes where the drama felt like it lost it direction and didn't know how to stir it towards the end.

Started off well enough but what i can only assume is the last season, ended on a sour note for me. Putting aside all the usual woke trappings I've come to associate with Netflix, was a brief but nasty poke, at people who have concerns around what appears to be the COVID vaccines. 

In my country, like many others, people were coerced into taking experimental vaccines with threats of job loss. Moreover, increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that those concerned about the efficacy and safety of these products, may well have every reason to be so. Still an on going consideration, not one to be tritely dismissed. 

Beyond this, season fives story was alright but it did feel like the ideas were running thin and the net result was basic and in itself, not overly inspiring.Nor for that matter was it genuinely funny. Instead, leaning on childlike humour about things like ""bum bums"". Really?

Yet... we don't seem to get tired of them, do we?. Well, 'Historias para no dormir' demonstrates that even if we have already seen these stories before, that doesn't really mean that we won't find any interest in seeing them again. The main reason why this show can captivate many horror lovers nowadays, is mostly because of the beautiful display of Gothic imagery. It's a fact that sometimes it's all about the right atmosphere and imagery. Narciso Ibañez Serrador, the creator of the show, achieves admirable results with some of the most famous horror tales such as 'The Raven', 'The Cask of Amontillado' and 'The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar' among others. The music composed by Pedro Baldie and Waldo de los Rios creates the perfect dark and sinister atmosphere that should accompany what is seen on the screen. The background music is repeated in several different episodes, which could be considered as a lack of effort by some people. Personally, I think that is not exactly a bad thing. It is in some way emblematic and why not use the same music for different episodes when it is so well composed?.

5345,The Legend Of Vox Machina,"Animation, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.232,"A very Dugeon & Dragon-esk type of animation.  The animation company is very well known and has good quality.  I believe they are very similar in what was used to make _Gargoyles_ tv animated series.  
There is a character for each of the classes, and fortunately each character _is_ a character unto themselves.  They are very different and fuse into what a good team of friends could be if they found themselves born to such a world.  There is enough gore to go around, and the writers did well with the comedy and gore alike.  The story for this title's pilot is a solid 8 out of 10.  The rich kid's mission for revenge against a sinisterly evil and neigh OP bad guy is epically done well, and is NOT something that is expected coming out of a Netflix streaming show.  Okay, enough about the pros.

The Cons:  And ofcourse when talking about **_anything_** from Netflix there are the **glaring** cancerous influences of social politics infesting the show.  In most cases it's usually the narrative that is corrupted, but when that is not a possibility, SJWs settle for the background.  There are different races in areas where there should be no variety in the people.  There is the typical flamboyantly gay racial minority fat-guy who is a keystone in supplying or getting knowledge of important artifacts.  >exasperated sigh< Ofcourse one of the young men in the main party has to flirt with the fat-guy to bargain with him. Annnnd ofcourse fat-gay-minority guy is OP in his own right, because you have to balance out the implied insult that successful minority men of commerce are all ""flamers.""  And what adventure is not complete without toilet humor?  Because that's what you need as you eat dinner to watch a show.  >groans<

Another major gripe of mine is the over-compensation of rude language to qualify for the streaming rating.  When I say overcompensate, I mean the ""seinen"" aspect to the show is unbalanced.

  It's like how are you going to swear so much in a show, show SOOOO much blood and gore, then leave out the nudity??  And if there is nudity, why does it have to be tied to something gay?  Usually with Netflix, this means male gay.  And since the majority of the viewing audience is male, it becomes, ""Why did you even bother??""  It kills the nuance of the show, it's grittiness of the age.  Gay instances were _never_ mainstream even in that time.  Sure it went on, but no one gave it that kind of attention.  And if they did, no one mentioned it aloud, not without threat of loosing their head.  Even gay romance with women, from a guy's point of view, is a snooze-fest of epic proportions because with the social politics not wanting to ""degrade women..."", this little edict (no one asked for) neutralizes **_all_** sensuality (if there ever was any).  There is nothing to the show that makes you want to see _more_ of this show if that is supposed to the ""eye candy""!?!  _That's_ what we're getting?!?  I counted, you know.  There were two pairs of boobs in this entire 12 episode first season.  4 tits; one of those pair belonged to an ugly mutant.  Funny story, lackluster presentation.  That is not enough boobs to get me to put up with another season of non-existent nudity, covert or overt homosexuality, and excessively crude language.  You take out any two of these and you are left with a show not worth viewing. At best it's okay; at worst, it's annoying.  Again, it becomes, ""Why am I watching this???""

The studio would have done better to ex out all nudity or implied situations, modern swearing, and gore.  And just ran the show as an animated series.  Kids (should) out number adults when it comes to this kind of viewing genre, so the studio would have been better served in this regard.  And again this ""imbalance"" has caused some serious errors in judgement and showing; potentially hurting its Nielsen rating.  In other words, it could have been more with less, instead of trying to be something more and falling short.  There is enough story, plot, action and engaging characters to make this show good.  In fact, if I ignore the social political negatives (with a LOT of effort), the show is downright entertaining.  I simply don't want to have to put in a focused effort (should never have to) to ignore the SJW aspect _every time_ I watch the show.

Don't know about you, but I'm not holding any bated breath for next season.

5349,Vagabond,"Drama, Mystery, Action & Adventure",8.3,"**_Did I just watch a true-to-life movie series?_**

**WARNING**: Some may find a few of the information mentioned a _spoiler_.

**I. Story**
Overall, the story was great. The number of twists and turn, unexpected revelations, the high level political game, and the multiple layers, made this series one of the best crime drama of this decade ('10s). However, it failed closing the story properly.

In the last episode (16th), it was obvious it was rushed. There was no direction. Everything the series built up from episodes 1 to 15 disappeared. It started awesome, then became great, good, and ended poorly.

It is common among creative writers to have an open-ended story but in this case the ending was not an open-ending, no, it was a cliffhanger intended to be a premise for a guaranteed Season 2. If the intention was to have an open-ending, it should have ended with them driving to the airport. Everything else after that scene killed what made it great.

I still give it 8 out of 10 stars for the story regardless of the disaster after the ""driving to the airport scene"". I also applaud the writers and director for not inserting romantic scenes just because their lead female is well-known for it.

**II. Acting**
Suzy did well in portraying an intelligence officer. This was a big change from her usual romantic roles and I wasn't expecting she can pull it off. Yet, in the first two episodes, she already shone in her role, that's a sure sign of a talented actress.

The acting of the other actors were superb. I usually see them in dramas about family and relationships, seeing them portray political and intelligence roles was refreshing and in they owned the characters they portrayed in series.

Together, the acting were too believable I kept thinking I was watching a fictionalised true story. The characters were too real, all thanks to their acting and synergy.

**III. Production**
Did I just watch a 16-episode (16-hour) movie? It was clear they spent money on Vagabond to get it all right. But in the last episode the explosions were very bad. This was the other reason why I said earlier that anything after the ""driving to the airport"" scene should not have been included.

**IV. Overall score**
All things considered. I give it a rating of 8 out of 10 stars. The superb acting and quality production were what pulled it up, and for avoiding creating romantic scenes just because they have a great romantic-genre actress as a female lead.

While the drama had action later on but it wasn't on the same level of its earlier episodes. The plot itself couldn't compensate for that.

The lines between the Finnish police officers being morally or legally correct in their actions, is at times ambiguous and on occasion, they are clearly in the wrong. 

This tends to lend a human depth to this show, that's absent from a lot of mainstream cop series. Characters are relatable because of their contradictions, their flaws and their qualities. Indeed, this show is as much about the police service, as ordinary people, as it is about policing. 

Acting, like the writing is, generally, of a very high standard. Investing characters with this kind of simple human depth, takes real talent.

5365,Live Up To Your Name,Drama,6.8,"Things can get really muddy when talking about the science of acupuncture, although this is a fantasy but to try and push one narrative over the other this desperately is a tough sell in this scenario. I don't think the drama managed to navigate mixed medicine practices from a modern medicine point of view successfully. In fact, the entire thing was dropped very quickly a few episodes later without being brought up again. So why did they ever bother? The first 5 episodes were enjoyable without overbearing time-travel cliches. However, everything turned to worse with episode 6, that's where they introduced your typical mundane cheese of someone who traveled in time.

Disabilities are still a very real taboo in many countries and Autism Spectrum is still very much misunderstood. This series addresses some of the misconceptions from a first person view. And how difficult it is to engage in a relationship with someone who has autism, no matter how smart they are. From a father's perspective and a lover's perspective.

All the while the series does't only focus on that, but provides some nice legal battles, friendships, power struggles and manipulation ""with good intentions"". It's brilliantly acted by all of the cast. The lovers relationship feels very real and you can just see why that guy would fall for her.

5392,Kolchak: The Night Stalker,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",7.6,"The influential Kolchak TV series from 1974-1975

The TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker ran for one season in 1974-1975, consisting of 20 episodes. Two additional episodes were scheduled to be filmed, but star Darren McGavin was becoming disillusioned with due to an exhausting schedule and the fact that he was rewriting scripts plus doing much of the production work without compensation.  The ratings were mediocre so he asked to be released from his contract with two episodes yet to be shot. The network granted his request in light of the ratings. I wish Darren would’ve persevered and finished out the season because then we’d have two more episodes to enjoy. He was too fatigued at the time to see that this unique and groundbreaking series would be his most well-known role, along with “A Christmas Story” (1983).

If you haven’t seen the two pilot movies, “The Night Stalker” (1972) and “The Night Strangler” (1973), I encourage you to view them before checking out the series. The debut movie was the best of the batch with “The Night Strangler” almost as good and even better in some ways (see my reviews for details). Both movies established the template (formula) for the TV series and myriad books that followed.

The 20 episodes are more of the same, but condensed into 51 minutes and all-around inferior. They’re all of about the same quality with favorites emerging depending on how interesting the Monster-of-the-Week is, as well as the guest stars, both of which are a matter of taste. The first episode, “The Ripper,” is a quality beginning for the series but it’s too much like the two pilot movies for its own good, particularly the first film. It’s basically a compressed version with a slightly different ‘monster.’ 

“Horror in the Heights” is usually cited as the best segment because of the intriguing monster, which can mimic a person its victim trusts. It’s actually pretty chilling for mid-70’s television. “The Trevi Collection” is one of my personal favorites because it deviates from formula and contains a twist. The story tackles witchcraft but doesn’t make the mistake of doing it in a one-dimensional manner (e.g. the mannequins). “The Energy Eater” is another fave due to guest stars William Smith, who beams with charisma, and professional-but-sultry Elaine Giftos, both of whom sorta team-up with Kolchak, particularly the former. 

“The Vampire” is distinguished for its ties to the pilot movie and taking place in Los Angeles rather than Chicago, not to mention its vicious no-talking (and sharp) antagonist. “Demon in Lace” is one of the better episodes due to the intriguing succubus and the campus locale. “The Zombie” is notable for its formidable foe and one of the creepiest sequences in the last act at a junkyard. The monster make-up in “The Werewolf” is lame, but I favor the episode because it takes place completely on a cruise ship and features voluptuous & perky Jackie Russell as Wendy (in a black bikini); and Nita Talbot as Paula, who becomes Kolchak's gal pal. 

The low points, for me, are the clunky “The Knightly Murders” (no pun intended), and “The Chopper,” which devolves into camp. Yet even those episodes have their points of charm. The final segment, “The Sentry,” is often reviled due to the reptilian creature costume, but it would’ve worked if the creators kept its cartoonish face & teeth obscured. The story rips-off Star Trek’s “Devil in the Dark,” but isn’t anywhere near as absorbing. Yet this is partially made up for by the beaming & lovely Kathie Browne as Lt. Irene Lamont. Kathie was McGavin’s wife for 34 years until her death in 2003. You might recall her as hottie Deela in Star Trek’s “Wink of an Eye” from seven years earlier. Unsurprisingly, she & Darren have great chemistry.

The concept of the show, and its star (and some of the co/guest stars), are better than the actual execution of most of the episodes. The show needed someone of the caliber of Gene Roddenberry at the helm. As it turned out, the bulk of the pressure & work fell on McGavin’s shoulders and thus he couldn’t even finish out the season. Nevertheless, the show was seminal and acquired a cult-following, influencing more popular future series like The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural and The Walking Dead.

Kolchak is an obnoxious reporter and terrible role model. He does anything for a story.

It's impossible not to notice this worship of Hitler's genocide program. You feel like you're watching the reels of Nazis taking beautiful brunettes out to be executed.
That's the weakest part of the series, and it's impossible not to notice. It appears either the writer or director was jilted by too many brunettes in his life and couldn't get over it.

5402,The Dragon Prince,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.3,"The Dragon Prince...what can be said about it?  A lot.  
Never have I seen the liberal agenda operate so consistantly seemless since the Little Mermaid's release date.  The amount of social inconsistances portrayed under the guise of this being fictional animation is astounding!  

You know what this reminds me of when I see an agenda played out in this manner?  It reminds of reading books that are the source material as opposed to seeing the book made into a movie for the big screen.  There is sooooo much more shock n' awe in the books than you'll ever get from the movie.  But here in this animation they (the liberal studio) took that concept and ran with it!!  Bravo. 

Here you have a coming of age boy, who is (stifled sniggering) the step-son to the _>hissing laughter through teeth<_ the king!! _>guffawing laughter<_  Yeah!!  That's right, the KING married to, interracially mind you, _>leg raising laughter<_ a single-mother!!! _>farting laughter, eyes flooded with tears, stomping one foot, gut-clenching laughter<_   

No wait!! It gets better!!  The co-lead is another ""boy"" with horns who is supposed to be a girl of exceptional theiving & assassination skills.  Of course she can out-do the boy (MC) on every physical level; he's--I mean, she's a wood-elf.  And they are beings of magic!  So, why not be better than him at everything??  I guess you're wondering what the whole ""he"" thing is about with white-hair horn-head super elf, huh?  Well, that's because the artists drew her in such a way that you can't tell, save for the voice, if the character is female or not. (Just mute the show while you watch it; you'll see what I mean.)  Because she certainly doesn't have any feminine qualities.  Naw!!  Can't have those pesky froo-froo girl traits getting in the way of her awesome-ness.  Perish the thought. lmao

I mean it was soooo long ago that one could just look at a character and know who was a girl and who was a boy.  Now, it's damn near sacrilegious, to draw boobs on a 15 year old girl, pouty lips, or any kind of feminine hairstyle.  
Oh you pervert you for being heterosexual!!  Ah, 2013, how we miss you so. >sighs< 
Let's not forget that if the show goes longer than 3 minutes without demostrating how bad-ass any woman can be, then the next 3 scenes you'll be punished with how EVIL & misguided men are.  And if they don't have those great traits, then you are privilaged with seeing how they are bumbling, dependent, clueless, indecisive dolts.  Oh, and gullible.  Can't forget gullible to an extreme.  But it's better than being a citizen of magic.

When you're born of the magic, there is 60% chance you are in a same sex relationship or pursuing a same sex relationship!  Exciting & daring is it not!!  To be a natural wielder of magic and natural wielder of same sex whoopi time!!  Not too many disappointed beings on the magic side of things, huh?  Of course if you are heterosexual then you'll have to use your imagination for all the good this animation will show you.  Same sex & hope = good.  Heterosexual = bad, strange, and unlikely.
And I know what you're going to say, ""But the lead boy and the elf girl kiss!!""  _[stares at you like you're the village idiot]_  You mean, the white-haired ""dude"" with a girl's voice?  Yeaaaaah, that romance was about as force as a wrong puzzle piece pounded into place.  How?  Well, she's bad-ass, but suddenly at the end of the show she needs him to rescue her!?  Really??  That one time, the _only_ time, he rescues her once, after she's been incredibly capable the entire, however many episodes, there at the end...she needs saving?   Like I said, forced.

The animation is fine (except for the fact if both the leads were mute **you would not be able to tell** which was the female). And the story flows well enough.  But there are too many checkboxes for me to enjoy this--And I'm black!!
List of Inconsistances shoe-horned in because this is ""Fantasy"" are as follows :

* Interracial marriage.
* Royal Interracial marriage to a single mother
* Homosexual Elves --though not sure how much of an inconsistancy-- Ah, it's bogus.  On account that elves are proud, and even prouder warriors.
* Same sex royal marriage
* Same sex royal marriage with kid?!!? --I can't even think that w/o a WTF face--
* Androgynous co-lead female
* Androgynous co-lead female that is more skilled than her homosexual male Captain.
* Handicap female leader of a military force
* Royal handicap female leader of a military force
* the fact that all royalty put themselves in harm's way to fight the most dangerous of magical foes -- the dragon king.  You mean to tell me, they had kingdoms but no loyal knights to fight for them??
* The misled evil white man's daughter with severe daddy issues of Approval that makes her a NOT-SO good person due to her personal choices to suck the life out of innocent beings to save her family.
* the dolt son to the evil white man, who is a good soul but not until he gets people killed or seriously injured
* Another female leader of the magic fairies, this one is for lava.  Annnnnd she's gayer than pink pineapple in the hands of Rupe Hall.  
* And last but certainly not least, the angry young guy who will not listen to reason because the evil white man framed the fairies for his father's murder!  Oh, I do believe HE is supposed to be Latino.  So I guess they were represented too!!  Yaaaaay!!

But this was just a list of all the things a ""normie"" would miss if they were not skilled (or 10yrs old, OR a housewife) in looking for a good well written story.  Like I said, the animation is good, but everything else about this ""animation"" is horridly forced, contrived, and painstakingly predictable.

So, instead what you have is kind of what you see in every other television show created post 2016, only with an anthology feel that kind of misses the mark because politics don't allow people to be individuals and more than surface deep.

So it's as interchangeable as every other show on television today that stays with that format.

5415,The Queen'S Gambit,Drama,8.5,"After zipping through this gripping miniseries, I think I have a new favorite Netflix original.

Its star, Anya Taylor-Joy, is quickly becoming a favorite as well, delivering a great performance as Beth Harmon, a genius young chess player struggling with substance abuse and mental and emotional hurdles holding her back from her relationships and from true mastery of the game. She's charming, but also cool and calculated, reserved yet fun when she wants to be, and very beautiful and captivating as the lead in a big period drama like this. Her supporting cast carries their weight well, with lots of faces I've never seen, but many that I won't soon forget. The strange cowboy-esque New Yorker Benny Watts (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and the imposing chess veteran, Soviet world champion Vasily Borgov (Marcin Dorociński) were highlights, both huge parts of what makes the show work and give it some of its biggest emotional moments by the end.

Although chess is played on a tiny board and has intricacies far above the heads of most of the audience, careful editing in terms of pacing and commentary has elevated the game here into an exciting spectator sport, even for beginners. When Taylor-Joy's Beth sits across from the champion Borgov for their various matchups, I felt like I was sitting down to watch the NBA Finals or the Super Bowl. The show does a great job building up its climactic matches by laying out the emotional stakes and showing all the nights of hard work, all the mistakes, all the surprises and reversals, zoomed in at the exact right times to drive it home. It really inspires you to want to learn more about this complex game.

Lastly, I want to draw attention to the setting, not only the beautiful execution of the mid-century time period, but the many locales featured throughout. Although the show starts in small town Kentucky, it quickly escalates as Beth rises from regional tournaments to international ones, and it really gives the show this great feeling of progression as the hotels and dining get more lavish and the characters navigate new waters. With the exception of the section set in the USSR, which I think is perfect, sure, maybe they could have gotten more out of these locations. But I still think they all color their respective episode really well and are exciting to see. This globetrotting focus is balanced well with Beth's time at home in Kentucky and keeps the show dynamic. 

I hope more people watch this fantastic show. It's #1 on Netflix right now so looks like they are. I really think it benefits from the miniseries format over being a standard long-form TV drama, getting out just what it needs to with no time to become stale, and no risk of an unresolved cliffhanger ending. Can't wait to see what these people make next!","Anya Taylor-Joy, Chloe Pirrie","zip grip miniseries , think new favorite netflix original . star , anya taylor-joy , quickly become favorite well , deliver great performance beth harmon , genius young chess player struggle substance abuse mental emotional hurdle hold back relationships true mastery game .

5415,The Queen'S Gambit,Drama,8.5,"I was loving this (pretty much) right up until the last episode when a woke deus ex machina suddenly appears in a Corvair to save the day. The cinematography is nice and the story of triumph rolls right along sans all the normal impediments one might expect. The adoptive mother goes right along with our heroes desire to be a chess champ. I never expected that to be so easy for her, and it was a little too convenient that the father left town and never returned.

There ARE a few other implausibilities that annoyed me, like the fact that an 8 year old would become addicted to tranquilizers to the degree that Beth did. Was her mother an addict? That was never even hinted at. People generally don’t develop severe addictions on their own without at least some genetic motivation and you can’t have something that big happen in a film story without explaining it. 

And what about all the free time she was allowed playing chess in the basement of the orphanage with the custodian. Also, I’m not sure how ALL the dancing came into it, because young Beth never danced around alone in her room. 

And, another thing I don’t fully understand is Beth’s desire to be a chess champion. Sure, she loves playing, but where did the inherent need to be the best chess player on Earth come from? That was never explained at all and I expected it to maybe be motivated by a need to make money since the adoptive father abounded her and the mother, but nope, that didn’t even happen. 

When a character is driven to do something, it’s generally because of some deep seated need or dire circumstance, but in this film we never see that need. It’s just there, and that’s lazy writing.","Anya Taylor-Joy, Chloe Pirrie","love ( pretty much ) right last episode wake deus ex machina suddenly appear corvair save day . cinematography nice story triumph roll right along sans normal impediments one might expect . adoptive mother go right along heroes desire chess champ . never expect easy , little convenient father leave town never return . implausibilities annoy , like fact 8 year old would become addict tranquilizers degree beth . mother addict ? never even hint . people generally ’ develop severe addictions without least genetic motivation ’ something big happen film story without explain . free time allow play chess basement orphanage custodian . also , ’ sure dance come , young beth never dance around alone room . , another thing ’ fully understand beth ’ desire chess champion . sure , love play , inherent need best chess player earth come ? never explain expect maybe motivate need make money since adoptive father abound mother , nope , ’ even happen . character drive something , ’ generally deep seat need dire circumstance , film never see need . ’ , ’ lazy write .",1,1
5449,Definitely Neighbors,Drama,1.3,"The drama was a frustrating experience, primarily due to its main plotline which flopped majorly. They probably choose the worst route to execute its main story. Both leads and their love interests were a bad combination that spawned a dreadful dynamic for 65 episodes. Subsequently, the resolution after endless quarrels was equally dreadful and ended in a flat let down. On the other hand, the side plots and relationships were better in comparison but nothing stood out. Conflicts seemed forced and resolutions lacked any real emotional impact. The drama failed to offer any redeeming qualities that could compensate for its lackluster central storyline. It was unbelievably forceful and super giga cringe to have the FL attend her ex-husband wedding for the ending.

5451,The King In Love,Drama,4.2,"The way they handled things was just all over the place. This loathsome love triangle infested its core amidst everything else. Forcefully pushing it in our throats around every single detour. It got trashier the longer it kept going.  The drama was covered with palace politics, as always, but it was impossible to care about anything because they just obsessed over who's in love with whom, overshadowing anything the drama tried to offer. The pacing followed through in that regard—slow moments that dragged on forever for what could have been a quick tale. The drama fell way short of establishing a watchable narrative. It was like biting into a cookie and finding out it's all crumbs.","Yim Si-wan, Yoona, Hong Jong-hyun, Park Hwan-Hee, Oh Min-suk","way handle things place . loathsome love triangle infest core amidst everything else . forcefully push throats around every single detour . get trashier longer keep go . drama cover palace politics , always , impossible care anything obsess 's love , overshadow anything drama try offer . pace follow regard—slow moments drag forever could quick tale . drama fell way short establish watchable narrative . like bite cookie find 's crumb .",1,1
5457,Johnny Test,"Animation, Comedy, Kids",6.373,"Honestly this show is amazing... well the first 3 seasons are. The first season is honestly the best out of all. The animation is smooth, the characters are funny, the intro is really good and there are absolutely no whipcracks. The second season is amazing too, but not as amazing as the first season. For starters, from this season on, because the production studio changed from being produced in-house at Warner Bros, to being produced in Canada at Cookie Jar, the show is animated in Flash, and while that is absolutely not a bad thing (if you know how to use it), I mean, look at Total Drama, it does look pretty choppy at times, ad some of the characters do look pretty bad when translated to flash. In my opinion, a good example is Dukey. The characters remain basically unchanged, Hugh is still the best character. Another problem starting with this season is the reuse of topics. There are at least 3 Johnny X episodes in season 2 alone. Season 2 also introduced the whipcrack sound effect, but it is nowhere near overused in this season. I'd say it's only used once to thrice per episode. Another introduction to this season is the new theme song that will be used for the rest of the series, and it is literally a copy of American Idiot by Green Day. Season 5 is where it starts to get bad. Really bad. For starters, there is a new title sequence (a theme song is the music, the title sequence is the animation), which is honestly pretty lazily animated because this season had the production studio change again from Cookie Jar to Atomic Cartoons, ad the show is still being animated in Flash, but from first glance, there isn't a difference, but this season is where the show gets horrible, not only because the characters start to get flanderized, but because this season is where the aforementioned whipcrack sound gets really overused, to the point where in the 100th episode special, ""Johnny's 100th Episode"", the episode has the series record for whipcracks at nearly 200.

5470,Reign,Drama,8.1,"This is a terribly sterile, unsexy and over-scripted series rescued - at times - by Megan Follows as the manipulative Catherine de Medici but otherwise having little to recommend it to anyone. Based, very loosely, on the early life of Mary, Queen of Scots (Adelaide Kane) at the court of King Henry II, where she has been betrothed since an infant to the Dauphin (Toby Regbo). The series uses a considerable degree of cinematic licence as we follow her well documented trials and tribulations as she navigates the conspiracies of the French court; but it does it without any soul - or passion. It needn't have been an HBO romp-along; but there are just way too many 'pretty' actors delivering pedestrian scripts; set-piece plots and mysteries. Even when things do get a touch romantic (they never get raunchy) we take comfort in a folk-style soundtrack and some lovely shots of what are, admittedly, some fine locations. Follows makes sure that there are plenty of conspiracies to keep up her end of the bargain, but Regbo and the gorgeous, but totally pointless character of ""Bash"" (Torrance Coombs) seem there to add looks but little else to this really mediocre telling of what must have been an extremely eventful few years in peril and love for such an enigmatic Queen.","Adelaide Kane, Megan Follows, Celina Sinden, Craig Parker, Jonathan Goad","terribly sterile , unsexy over-scripted series rescue - time - megan follow manipulative catherine de medici otherwise little recommend anyone . base , loosely , early life mary , queen scots ( adelaide kane ) court king henry ii , betroth since infant dauphin ( toby regbo ) . series use considerable degree cinematic licence follow well document trials tribulations navigate conspiracies french court ; without soul - passion . need n't hbo romp-along ; way many 'pretty ' actors deliver pedestrian script ; set-piece plot mysteries . even things get touch romantic ( never get raunchy ) take comfort folk-style soundtrack lovely shots , admittedly , fine locations . follow make sure plenty conspiracies keep end bargain , regbo gorgeous , totally pointless character `` bash '' ( torrance coombs ) seem add look little else really mediocre tell must extremely eventful years peril love enigmatic queen .",1,1
5471,Start-Up,"Drama, Comedy",8.3,"**_A great watch … worth it!_**

_**WARNING**: Contains information others might consider as a spoiler._

**I. Story**
_a. Episode stories_: The stories per episode were mostly good. Out of 16 episodes, I like the story of 9 episodes.

_b. Series story_: From the title, ""Start-Up"" (or ""Sandbox""), it gives the impression that it is primarily about starting up a business or about joining a, well, sandbox program. However, overarching story is more about [1] a love triangle and [2] sibling rivalry. The impression from the series title only takes tertiary importance. It would have been better if the importance was as follows: [1] sibling rivalry; [2] start-up/sandbox/business; and [3] love triangle.

Regardless… the way the overarching stories were delivered and the choice of story per episode were enough to pull up the score for this rating.

However, avoid introducing important facts and then never mentioning it again. For example, Ji Pyung and the sisters have met when they were kids. It was also weird that a bloodied person can pitch his company, that does not happen in real life.

**II. Acting**
Acting! This is where I had to give a low rating.  There were too many crying scenes where the facial expression was neutral. It was obvious they were only ""acting"" instead of actually feeling and letting their emotions out.

I'm a fan of Suzy but I have to mention this: relax more during kissing scenes, make us feel it, and it doesn't need to be ""wild"". The kissing scenes can still be romantic even if there wasn't too much lip action. A room for improvement. I love her acting and the way she brings life to the characters she plays but the kissing scenes needs improvement. Relax, take it slow, don't make it wild -- rather make it romantic. Don't act, imagine he's your boyfriend or some secret desire. You want to enjoy the moment, to just let him feel your desire.

As for Joo Hyuk, great job in portraying what appears to be an eccentric, possibly even an autistic, character. It is never easy if an actor is not in the autism spectrum--in particular asperger syndrome. Very geeky, logical, all about facts, and clueless about everything else, especially fashion and social skills. Those scenes where Dal Mi was sending signals and Do San missed it all--those were all great. Sometimes annoying but all of it were relatable. Neutral face, going back to the discussion he was focused on, definitely a character with aspergers syndrome. Well done there.

For Han Na, excellent job in keeping the character mysterious. It was not easy when the character In Jae had a change of heart, especially when it comes to her sister. There were clues but the next moment it's the total opposite. This happens in real life and so it's great to see it on screen.

**III. Music**
This one is hard. I can not remember any memorable music other than the theme songs.

**IV. Rewatch Value**
Definitely in my list of series that I'll choose to re=watch.

**V. Summary**
Overall, the production, story, and acting were awesome. The inclusion of business terminologies and explaining each, that was a very good idea. Explaining the processes, the whys and the hows, definitely a plus. It would have been better if they toned down the ""young adult"" giggles because that very rarely happens in-real-life. They should've used sandbox and showed the idea behind it and what's happening in it more as well, instead of just providing a free office and free funding.

The ""revolutionary"" ideas were well thought out especially the app helping those with vision challenges. I do hope such an app exists but we haven't achieved that speed of AI recognition still something to look forward to. Great choices on scenes and I wish they added more, like a team building session where they could feature the beauty of Korea instead of the exact same office.

Although obviously Martin Clines dominates the show with his quirky personality, it is nevertheless an ensemble show, with great support from actors playing oddball characters. Aspects of the show are predictable: guest stars’ characters are apt to contract rare ailments, and Doc will need to make one or two emergency house calls per episode.

5593,Killing Eve,"Crime, Drama",8.0,"This show hits the sweet spot between Spy Mystery adventure and Comedic thriller. The main characters are so boldly drawn and some of the action and plots so fantastical that the viewer would be forgiven for continually thinking...satire. Yet, the series stays true to a ""real life"" plot which it wants you to take seriously. Jodie Comer does a fantastic job of getting us into the mind of this off kilter psychopathic killer. Eventually, I think we do understand Villanelle who turns out to be the show's real protagonist. I'm not sure if Sandra Oh choice as Eve Polastri was a genius casting decision or an epic mistake. Either way, she did an excellent job as first a foil then a lost soul. The others, as I said before, seemed properly over the top in the espionage or police and crime genre to be recognizable yet also unique. I give great credit also some inspirational writing which created many brilliant individual vignettes and memorable exchanges.

5598,Grotesquerie,"Drama, Mystery, Crime",7.3,"I'm only two episodes in but there are aspects of this show I'm not liking. One is the woman at the hospice and the other is the nun, not so much the nun, but the fact that she is being given all these details about an ongoing serial murder case, on a whim.

Then there's the other issue, that our lead protagonist never seems phased by what she sees but literally everyone else is disturbed to the point of barfing everywhere. It wouldn't be an issue if they didn't INSIST on showing everyone disturbed all the time and someone barfing all the time. _You're contaminating a crime scene. Get a barf bag or !@#$ off._

Them (2021) Season 2 did this better.

5598,Grotesquerie,"Drama, Mystery, Crime",7.3,"Well, if you've seen American Horror Story, that's pretty much what you're getting.  Some seasons of AMS really work for me, others really not so much.
I find when Ryan Murphy tries to play with his formula he mostly fumbles it.
Niecy Betts is an excellent lead and it's good to see her with the space to round a character out - she's truly really good in this and backed by a strong supporting cast, Goodwin and Diamond in particular.

I enjoy camp, but about half way through the season there's an absolutely senseless, anachronistic and frankly painful musical number, that had me absolutely cringe - I felt embarrassed for the cast members involved.  To follow this up, Murphy tries to flip the script and introduce a clumsy twist - is it a dream?  Jesus, really?  Half way through the season?  Ok, if you're going to start the series with this kind of premise, but introducing it after stakes and investment are built?  Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.  I very nearly gave up on it entirely at this point, but thought I'd stick it out.

5603,X-Men '97,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.555,"The nostalgia factor in this animated series is truly remarkable. The creators did an exceptional job of capturing the essence of the original 90s characters. However, there is one notable drawback in the form of voice casting. Some voices, like those of characters Rogue and Wolverine, are difficult to listen to. Despite this flaw, the overall voice work for other characters is commendable, making the show enjoyable.

After completing the series and reflecting on my initial review, I have decided to revise my rating from 4 1/2 stars to 3 1/2 stars. While the show excels in nostalgia and character creativity, there are certain aspects that detract from the overall experience. The introduction of Cable as the son of Scott and Jean, a plot point I disliked from the comics, was disappointing. The portrayal of Cable as a sassy and somewhat entitled character felt like a departure from the original concept, which was disheartening.

While I appreciate inclusivity in storytelling, it felt forced at times in the series. The constant emphasis on representation, such as with Morph's non-binary character, seemed overwhelming, especially in a cartoon aimed at a younger audience. While I am supportive of diversity, I believe it should be integrated thoughtfully and not overshadow the narrative.

In conclusion, despite my reservations about certain aspects of the show, I still recommend giving it a watch. X-Men has always been a favorite superhero franchise of mine, and the series has its merits. It may not be perfect, but it is worth exploring for fans of the X-Men universe.",,"nostalgia factor animate series truly remarkable . creators exceptional job capture essence original 90s character . however , one notable drawback form voice cast . voice , like character rogue wolverine , difficult listen . despite flaw , overall voice work character commendable , make show enjoyable . complete series reflect initial review , decide revise rat 4 1/2 star 3 1/2 star . show excel nostalgia character creativity , certain aspects detract overall experience . introduction cable son scott jean , plot point dislike comics , disappoint . portrayal cable sassy somewhat entitle character felt like departure original concept , dishearten . appreciate inclusivity storytelling , felt force time series . constant emphasis representation , morph 's non-binary character , seem overwhelm , especially cartoon aim younger audience . supportive diversity , believe integrate thoughtfully overshadow narrative . conclusion , despite reservations certain aspects show , still recommend give watch . x-men always favorite superhero franchise mine , series merit . may perfect , worth explore fan x-men universe .",1,1
5607,Busted!,"Comedy, Mystery",7.9,"I started to watch this show because I am a big fan of Lee Seung-gi, only to find out that he doesn’t join the cast until halfway through season 2 (I blame Netflix for false advertising!) Well, I am glad I watched the show because I got hooked from the beginning. My nephew (7 years old) started watching this with me because he found it so enjoyable, even with reading the subtitles. And slowly, we got more family members into the show.

I love the chemistry between the actors and how much they worked off each other in each episode. It is refreshing to see women (Kim Se-Jeong and Min-Young) as the top contributors to solving the cases and showing no fear in dangerous and scary situations. The males had no problem acknowledging the women for their bravery or giving them kudos for their smarts and letting them lead the team when needed, which was great to watch. The team leader is Jae-suk, who makes sure everyone knows where they are going and keeps them on task. Sehun is quiet and super competitive. Competition and Lee Seung-gi seem to bring out the fun and quirky side to him. He also steps up when he realizes that no one else is willing to do a task and will get his hands dirty to get the job done. Kwang-soo and Jong-min are the comedic relief and have their moments of genius once in a while. Detective Ahn watches everyone quietly and will contribute when needed. It is a well-crafted team, with each person contributing something different.

Season 1 starts rough. Though the episodes are entertaining individually, as a collective, the plot and logic fall short. They connected all the pieces in the end, but I felt like they didn't explain the connections properly. The second and third seasons are amazing, and they did a great job on the plot. Everything that was lacking in season 1 they fixed in seasons 2 and 3. Even when episodes seemed random, in the end, they fit together in the overall plot. And they would reference season 1 characters and episodes to connect all three seasons. 2nd and 3rd seasons felt like a whodunit mystery where you know the killer has to be one of the characters on the show, and you are looking at and finding clues with the team. At the end of seasons 2 and 3, with the killers' identity revealed, you realize all the clues present throughout the season hinting at the answer. And I have to say the people producing, directing, and shooting the show do a great job of showing you clues and reactions of the characters without you getting suspicious. But looking back, you realize all the signs that you ignored.

5618,Dark Matter,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.81,"Why does every series with a premise based on alternate reality, look a whole lot like every other series with the same premise?

The fact is tales of alternate reality have been done to death, so much so, that the whole premise now looks a lot like a cliche. Dark Matter has an instant issue, with this reviewer, for this very reason.

There have been series that have pulled it off beautifully, like German series Dark. It worked because there was enough complexity and depth in the alternate reality story, not to mention it played wonderfully with paradoxes.

By contrast, Dark Matter feels simplistic and predictable. It was obvious within a few frames who the masked attacker is and what comes after doesn't really improve greatly on this observation. Indeed, its largely unsubtle in its handling, which does little to draw you in or have you asking questions as Dark did.

Acting is reasonable, its a solid cast and whilst production values are high, this one just doesn't resonate with me after two, rather pedestrian, episodes.

In summary, the simplistic and predictable, lets call it ""safe"" handling doesn't put this series in the same class, as imaginative risk takers, like Dark. If you have't seen this kind of series before you may still enjoy Dark Matter, I have no doubt. That said, for the more seasoned and jaded science fiction viewers amongst us, its not an alternative reality, its just more of the same.","Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Connelly, Alice Braga, Jimmi Simpson, Dayo Okeniyi","every series premise base alternate reality , look whole lot like every series premise ? fact tales alternate reality do death , much , whole premise look lot like cliche . dark matter instant issue , reviewer , reason . series pull beautifully , like german series dark . work enough complexity depth alternate reality story , mention play wonderfully paradoxes . contrast , dark matter feel simplistic predictable . obvious within frame mask attacker come n't really improve greatly observation . indeed , largely unsubtle handle , little draw ask question dark . act reasonable , solid cast whilst production value high , one n't resonate two , rather pedestrian , episodes . summary , simplistic predictable , let call `` safe '' handle n't put series class , imaginative risk takers , like dark . have't see kind series may still enjoy dark matter , doubt . say , season jade science fiction viewers amongst us , alternative reality , .",1,1
5618,Dark Matter,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",7.81,"Dark Matter (2024) is a dismal misfire that fails on nearly every front. From the outset, it becomes painfully clear that “nothing matters” in this convoluted mess of amateur sci-fi soap opera and tedious family drama. The series boasts poor editing, with jarring cuts and pacing issues that make its already thin narrative feel even more disjointed. The characters are lifeless, reduced to cardboard archetypes who make inexplicably stupid decisions at every turn.
The supposed high-concept premise quickly devolves into unintentional comedy, weighed down by endless, repetitive family details that sap any potential for intrigue or suspense. Rather than offering compelling stakes, the show drags viewers through a nonsensical plot that fails to make its point—if it even had one. Any attempts at drama come off as ridiculous, leaving viewers more frustrated than entertained.
With no sense of direction or payoff, Dark Matter collapses into a black hole of mediocrity. It’s a waste of time, energy, and life—an experience devoid of entertainment or enlightenment. What could have been an engaging exploration of cosmic and existential themes instead becomes a tragic reminder of how not to make television.

5703,"My Lawyer, Mr. Jo",Drama,5.2,"In season 1: The introduction threw a wild scenario with a big stretch which helped attracting the viewers but the drama didn't return to the main case until the last 1/4. Meanwhile, it added fillers in the middle with okay cases but nothing interesting or outstanding like the initial jolt of rush, however, these middle parts helped connecting the characters together and form their relationships. The male lead character played out well with the setting and Park Shin Yang did a good job with his portrayal. The female lead was the most useless character in the drama. She had no role to play in anything other than being an insignificant side character. The return to the main case was good but unfortunately the drama went a bit soft in the punishment of the culprits.

Moving to season 2, I'm sure that season 2 is the worst non-consecutive sequel I've seen in any drama series ever. It's truly impressive how these seasons were in stark contrast to one another. Season 2 had a bad introduction and setup right away. There was a big disconnect between the male lead and his struggles. Which couldn't achieve the same impact as season 1. Everything the drama built, developed and achieved in season 1 was neglected in season 2. All cases were random generated garbage with little to no coherency to its theme, story and character. The male lead character was almost nothing like season 1. They went as far as erasing his past. He became a new character played by the same actor. It's a good example for how a character can change with a different director/writer even when hiring the same actor. Other than the 2 main lead, the drama had a full list of immemorable selection of cast members, completely blending into the background and turning into a white noise mush. Right from the beginning the female lead was the antagonist here but the drama built her story and character in a comical cheesy wronged by society kind of way. Her character had no real weight and ended up falling flat despite being played by a veteran actress Go Hyun Jung. The drama's attempt to make the viewers sympathize with her case and struggles at the end with an emotional climax was unsuccessful.

SEASON 01:

It has been twenty years since the revolution of 3D animation. The feature films are on the another level, but I always wondered why the television series are lagging behind on this. A few of them from the recent were not that impressive as this one. This surely would become a classic as the years to come. But don't judge it as it is only for children. That's what I surprised with. I should have seen it six months ago when it came. I was not discarding, but delaying my watch and now I regret that kind of mindset of mine.

Based on the book of the same name, co-written by Guillermo del Toro. One of the final works of Anton Yelchin before his unexpected death in the last year. I do not have to check for that, once I have heard the voice, I knew right away it was him. A very unique voice tone as only a very few in the film industry gifted with. He has done many good works, but this is the one to remember as his final.

The series had won three Annie Awards out of four nominees and several others. Really a great achievement in animation, the product that made for television. Definitely many 3D animated series would follow the same route. Especially I am expecting from the Disney as I am a big fan of it, despite their two famous films turned successfully into 2D animated series, which I liked they're not letting go the dying art of the early days. That's me. I want everything!

> ❝Destiny is a gift. Some to their entire lives, living existence as a quiet desperation.❞

I am a film fanatic, not series', but I regularly watch them. So, normally I won't review television series, unless I loved it's all the episodes. Which means, usually the documentaries and history related series'. Probably this is the first time for an entertainment series and I'm happy for doing that. I just want to let others know how great it is, because it is not one of the most watched series, unlike the high rating and praised big.

The season one consists of 26 episodes, just like the old days. Because, nowadays the series episodes are reduced between 10-13. You might have heard that recently the writers are on the protest for losing their work. Anyway, each episode was so awesome. Like full story, with lots of twist and turns. It could have made a fantastic film series of around 10 to 12 films like the 'Harry Potter'. Yeah, even as a live-action film is not a bad idea, since todays technology was far better than ten years ago.

BUT I'm happy for it as it is as a series, that makes it very unique. The characters were totally unpredictable. There are like 10-15 major characters and as the series progress, you would witness a complete changeover in them. And that's I call a perfect character development. I mean there are no flashbacks, but all the needed infos were revealed to us quite stylishly like with the missions in each episode.

It is obviously about a chosen one. I have not seen a masterpiece like this on the chosen one concept since 'The Lord of the Rings'. There is no wasting of time, it all begins right away and when that happened, I said 'here it comes the boring part'. After watching the first episode, I felt it was not bad. Awesome in fact. Then I was not expecting the following episodes to follow the same magic, but they did. As I watched first 3-4 episodes, I came to realise its brilliance. That's it, since then there's nothing to stop me as I finished watching the entire first season as much as soon as I can.

> ❝Well, I wouldn't really call it an issue, an issue is something you can fix.❞

The disappointment came from not with the series, but after ending my watch, there were no more to continue. So I can't wait for the second season, which is due later this year. One of the reasons I loved the series is for each episode was better the previous one. It's only going up in the graph of impressing its viewers. If someone did not like an episode means, probably he's did not pay attention in his watch. Coming back to the story, I liked the details of everything. Easy to follow and the introduction of all the characters are nicely done.

So a teenager named Jim Lake from a town called Arcadia becomes the first human Trollhunter after the amulet chose him. Soon he was guided by the two trolls and he was taken to their world called Heartstone Trollmarket that lies underneath the Arcadia. With his not so fierce training and other small-small missions, Jim has to improve his efficiency in order to do what he has chosen for. He struggles, but the faith on him among the trolls gives all the needed strength. That's when he meets Bular, the son of Gunmar who is trying to rise from the darkness.

Meanwhile, he has to face other threats like from Changleings and Goblins. With the help of his friends he succeeds most of the time in defending Trollmarket. The story aimed in one direction, but that does not stay that way for very long. One of the best things about this series is changing the course in its narration. Like in the halfway of the season, the Trollhunter who was preparing for his cause, has to face the threats from a different angle as he's the protector of the Trolls. Which makes the plot to go another way, while you are starting to predict on the other way. My first appreciation is the screen-writing. Well done del Toro.

> ❝You humans cut stones unlock their beauty, but trolls cut stones unlock their power.❞

When I and my niece watched 'Miraculous Ladybug...', she was chanting 'Tikki spots on' without her conscious and now I'm doing the same after watching this. Surely it's not just me, anyone who loved it like I did would do the same. Yeah, 'for the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command' is not just a word, though it became a slogan. It had good action sequences. There are sentiments too. As the season approaches its finale, it gets very emotional. I liked several characters, but AAARRGGHH was the top in my chart, followed by Blinky his philosophical dialogues. But not all the time what he says concerns about our world. Most of them are funny and inspiring.

Those characters are the soul of this series, but I don't know how the following season would stay with the same intensity. I hope they sort it out. Claire Nunez surely reminds Marinette as someone pointed out that in Pinster. It might be a co-incident, but a very fact, just like I still confuse between Mark Walhberg and Matt Damon. Then there's Toby, one of the best sidekick ever. He was fun, but according to the situation his role turns, yet still he remains fun.

The villains are great. It's always very important to match the hero or overpower. There is no just one bad guy, but many and each of them were so unique. By far, as how far this season went on, Angor Rot was the best. His powers simply amazes, even though he's a negative role. The Gumar is yet to be revealed so I can't make judgement on him. But Angor Rot was like Darth Vader of this story.

This could be DreamWorks animation's game changing program. But like usual the praise also goes to Netflix for joining the hand with. I don't know what they would do for Anton Yelchin casting in the season two. Surely they'll come up with something. Finally, I end my review by saying don't miss it, especially if you have kids in the house, watch with them for more fun. I hope to return for the next season review.

**_SEASON 02:_**

I don't know how to begin, because I loved the first season. The review was one of the longest I've ever written for any title. But this follow up season did not stand up to that standard. It's still a nice show with nice animation and all, I enjoyed watching it, though lesser.

I don't know what made it fall slightly. Maybe the first season had awesome villains and adventures, which totally lacked in this. Angor Rot, Strickler, Nomura, NotEnrique, particularly Bular, the son of Gunmar was brilliant. If only half of these guys had returned in full scale, the fate of the season would have been different.

That's not a big deal if they had introduced similar, powerful villains. But the Gunmar looked so weaker than his son. Especially they were too much hyped about Gunmar previously. Now he's here and had nothing big role. So I'm anticipating his part would come in the next season. Looks that way that they're saving him for the finale.

Anyway, like I said, I liked it. If you had liked the first, you would like this as well. I'm happy they had only half the episodes compared to the first. Sweet and short. The third and final season would come at the end of this year, so I'm eagerly looking forward to know how it all ends. Besides, I've not read the book, but surely Del Toro won't disappoint us.

> _There has been so much written and said about the murder, and thousands of suppositions, but not a trace of reality._

- Antonio D'Amico; """"My life was torn in two when Gianni was shot"": Versace's lover breaks silence"" (Angela Giuffrida); _The Observer_ (July 30, 2017)


Telling the story of the murder of Gianni Versace (Edgar Ramírez) at the hands of Andrew Cunanan (Darren Criss), what's especially interesting about this season of American Crime Story is the narrative structure. The opening scene of the first episode sees the murder, and the show then goes backwards, with each episode set earlier than the previous one, an achronological structure that unifies form and content; this isn't about a murder, it's about how Cunanan became a serial killer.

Within this, the show deals with two interrelated issues; 1) the concept that one must work hard to be successful, and 2) the desire to be remembered. Cunanan is obsessed with the second, but unwilling to acknowledge the first, despite his conviction of his own greatness. His attitude is nicely critiqued by Versace himself (""_Life isn't about convincing people you can do great things. It's about doing them_""), and the last shot masterfully encapsulates much of Cunanan's deepest existential fears. For all that, however, the season is good, but not great. The last two episodes are far and away the strongest, especially Jon Jon Briones's appearance as Modesto, Cunanan's detestable father, but, overall, it isn't a patch on _The People v. O.J. Simpson_.","Sarah Paulson, Beanie Feldstein, Annaleigh Ashford, Margo Martindale, Edie Falco","* * _thoughts 'the assassination gianni versace ' _ * * > _there much write say murder , thousands suppositions , trace reality._ - antonio d'amico ; `` '' life tear two gianni shoot '' : versace 's lover break silence '' ( angela giuffrida ) ; _the observer_ ( july 30 , 2017 ) tell story murder gianni versace ( edgar ramírez ) hand andrew cunanan ( darren criss ) , 's especially interest season american crime story narrative structure . open scene first episode see murder , show go backwards , episode set earlier previous one , achronological structure unify form content ; n't murder , 's cunanan become serial killer . within , show deal two interrelate issue ; 1 ) concept one must work hard successful , 2 ) desire remember . cunanan obsess second , unwilling acknowledge first , despite conviction greatness . attitude nicely critique versace ( `` _life n't convince people great things .

5722,A Touch Of Frost,"Drama, Crime, Mystery",7.478,"I have now watched the entire run of A Touch of Frost, stretching over 15 seasons and twenty years, which is quite an achievement for any drama show. To be honest, I never really connected with the lead character in the way I did Vera or Jimmy Perez on Shetland. It was the storylines that impressed me more, I suppose, except for a few clunkers where I napped in the middle and didn’t bother rewinding to catch up (Perhaps I shouldn’t watch TV in my comfy recliner!).

There are a few elements you can expect in every episode; he is going to yell at someone about the injustices against the downtrodden or victimized; he will mock his boss and usually be one step ahead of him (though Mullett scores points just often enough to keep it interesting); he will be hard on his assistants, often a new one for each new show as they don’t have much longevity. At least good old George hangs around to provide continuity.

I wouldn’t say there is a lot of character growth in DI Frost over the years: what you see is what you get. He will always bend rules and rush headlong into danger. Although near the end of the show’s run, he does start to value allowing personal space in his life for women, who seemed to be as short-lived as his assistants much of the time. And why wouldn’t he appreciate them more? Although he never attracts women half his age, they are always very attractive women, never a gray-haired grizzled veteran of life as he is.

The core premise of this series is the tale of a judge who is, in fact, a reincarnated demon who has to judge (in her own hellishly violent way and condemn to hell) murderous wrongdoers.

I suspect too, the jarring transition from humour to actually pretty nasty violence, is there to compensate for this series lack of true substance.

After watching the last episode of the season, I had this tingly feeling in my back of deja vu, and I spent a good fifteen minutes trying to find the source- which I found in the show “You”. Both shows depict this character trying to wash away their murderous tendencies and have a quote-unquote normal life, but failing at that at every turn. Barry, however, is significantly more… wholesome. There’s no stalking, he develops real connections with people, and at the heart of it, the show is a comedy. (It’s easy to tell Bill Harder came from comedy backgrounds)

Not only that but the cinematography is absolutely supreme. I came into the show knowing Bill Harder had studied film but it’s so evident- ESPECIALLY with the cold opens and the scenes where Barry’s PTSD are shown.

5843,Star Wars: Andor,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Action & Adventure, Drama",8.2,"""Star Wars: Andor"" takes a different approach to the galaxy far, far away. It's not about lightsaber duels or epic space battles, but rather the gritty reality of rebellion. This series delves into the everyday struggles of people fighting for a cause, and it does so with a refreshing realism that resonated with me deeply.

As a Star Wars fan, I've always been drawn to the core philosophy of the franchise – the constant struggle between good and evil, the reminder that life is about making choices and aligning yourself with one side or the other. ""Andor"" embraces this theme, but instead of showcasing grand battles and heroic deeds, it examines the everyday compromises and sacrifices that fuel a rebellion.

Cassian Andor, the series protagonist, is a welcome change from the typical Star Wars hero. He's not a Jedi with supernatural powers or a charismatic pilot with a knack for the Force. He's a man driven by personal loss and a deep sense of injustice, forced to make hard choices in a brutal, unforgiving world. He's flawed, relatable, and his Latin background adds a distinct layer of cultural richness to the story.

""Andor"" doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of the Star Wars universe. It explores the bureaucratic machinery of the Empire, the moral compromises people make to survive, and the devastating consequences of war on ordinary citizens. This level of detail and realism gave the series a powerful sense of immediacy, making me feel like I was truly a part of this world.

While I appreciate the epic scale and grand adventures of the Skywalker saga, ""Andor"" offered something different. It provided a nuanced and complex exploration of the political and social forces that shape the Star Wars galaxy. It gave me a deeper understanding of the sacrifices made by the rebels, the price of freedom, and the enduring power of hope in the face of tyranny.

If you're looking for a Star Wars story that goes beyond the lightsaber battles and focuses on the human cost of rebellion, ""Andor"" is a must-watch. It's a compelling and thought-provoking series that reminds us that the fight for freedom is a complex and often messy struggle.","Diego Luna, Stellan Skarsgård, Kyle Soller, Denise Gough, Adria Arjona","`` star war : andor '' take different approach galaxy far , far away .

When the story unfolds and you get to see how their love grows, it will warm your heart and at least in my case, was mixed with a lot of nostalgia because growing up as a gay teen my experience was filled with so much hiding, embarrassment, loneliness because i only had relationships based exclusively on the physical devoid of meaningful feelings, that why this series is so moving for me and I feel we rarely get to see this version of gay teen love, focused on romance and even idealized but in a uplifting way; I definitely prefer this idealized way than the fetichized way most of queer teen stories are depicted in series.

Even Nick **hesitated many times about coming out** in the series. I think people should be much more careful when watching the series because we have a character in the series **who thinks he is useless,** we have a character who cannot tell them about her own self because **her family is homophobic,** we have **a transgender character.** Like Tara, there are people who find it difficult to **come out as a lesbian both to themselves and to others.** All of the characters in the series are very young, and they did not do anything bad to experience such things.

6012,Nadia: The Secret Of Blue Water,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Family",7.4,"Finished October 1th 2022 

I can’t wait to see how fans of this show try to rationalize how many times lion balls appear on screen.

I always had a slight interest in this series whenever I first heard about it in the Nostalgia Critic covering Atlantis: The Lost Empire (I only care for the actual critic parts of the videos) and how it has so many similarities to this show even though movie makers say that they didn’t even know this show existed. I love Atlantis and I wanted to check out the series for myself, but I couldn’t find it anywhere. It was out of print and really expensive, but luckily GKIDS came in and made a rerelease of the dub and I got it and here we are now. 

The show was overall great, but there were definitely bumps in the road. I think the series strongest aspect is the characters. I mean Jean is fine standard protagonist, Marie was really cute, and Naida… we’ll get to her later, but dude, the Grandis Gang might be my favorite part of the show. I thought they were a really fun trio to hang out with. For the first few episodes, I figured that they would have the same dynamic as Team Rocket from Pokémon by how a trio of of kooky baddies trying to get their hands on one of the character’s prized possessions. But over the series, they turned out to be a lot more fleshed out and compassionate characters then Team Rocket. I mean I don’t think James and Meowth would would knock out Jessie just because they would rather sacrifice themselves than seeing Jessie in a life or death situation. Also I loved seeing them bond with the kids and it was really cute and loved their character interactions. Also Gargoyle was such a great and threatening villain, I mean I don’t get what was the point of going on a random killing spree whenever Marie was introduced and it’s never explained what we’re the motives behind that, but that’s a pretty minor nitpick. 

Where my dislikes start in a show called “Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water” is, well… Nadia herself. She is so horendiously unlikable and completely unreasonable. I get that she wants to protect nature and all and I get why she freaked out when the crew brought a baby deer to eat, but she blows up every time someone eats meat to survive or when someone kills another person in self defense and calls them murderers for that reason alone. Nadia rightfully gets called out for this THREE TIMES by Grantis, Captain Nemo, AND FREAKIN’ MARIE! There’s only so many times where a character learns the same lesson before it starts to feel really disingenuous. I guess the last time she acted really that selfish was when she learned that Nemo was her father and got separated from him. So I guess she just resorted to what she knows best by begin once again a selfish brat who thinks she’s in the right by denying basic survival skills which would honestly benefit her more than hurt nature, if at all. But no, she’s way too idiotically prideful in “protecting life” to even consider the implications of living on a deserted island and burns into a fit of rage when Jean actually uses proper brain functions to help them survives. But the 30% of the time that she’s actually tolerable, she’s a pretty alright female lead. I think Episode 24 was just the breaking point for me for this character. But I think even the show agrees with me because the recap in Episode 25, the narrator says outright talks about her selfish ways and Jean finally starts to get a backbone when Nadia won’t eat meat. Also in the same episode, Nadia finally comes around to Jean when he gets high on mushrooms and not the other multiple times he risk his life for her like the time when the Grandis Gang first captured her or the time he rescued her from Neo Atlantis. And it kinda sucks that such a pivotal point in Jean and Nadia’s relationship happens in such a lame episode. Episode 26 was pretty cute and it had pretty neat animated parts, but I wish the story was tweaked so the kiss happened in that episode and dedicated Episode 25 solely to Nadia’s backstory which should of probably happened way earlier in the series. Also the Island part of the show I didn’t really like a whole lot at first because that’s when I realized that the Grantis Gang added so much to the dynamic of the cast and I didn’t like when the show stripped the cast of characters down to just Nadia, Jean, and Marie. And that’s when Nadia REALLY started to get on my nerves because there wasn’t anything else to balance it out and that’s what ultimately brings the show down for me. We finally get the Grantis Gang back and their still as entertaining as ever, but even though their enjoyable, nothing in the island episodes really progressed the story in any way which is shocking. Every episode up until then furthered along the plot in a very natural way on top of being very entertaining. In these Island episodes, however, it just feels like we’re just meandering around until we get to the actually interesting plot lines. If it had started as a episodic series from the get-go and only occasionally had a story driven episode every once in awhile and not trying to have a laser focused narrative, then it wouldn’t be so painful to see this show fall off the high pedestal that series created for itself. Like would it have been SO hard to have at least ONE scene with Gargoyle trying to find the Blue Water and getting frustrated for going 4 MONTHS without a trace of it? I’m sorry, but these Island episodes are just FFFFFIIILLLLLEEERRRR!!!!!

Plus this is where the series’s animation starts to get really inconsistent. Like we get an episode where it’s animation is as detailed and fluent as ever, but the next episode’s animation is all rigged and clunky. My personal theory is that the show runners split up the most talented animators to work on the more important and visually demanding episodes while they chopped the budget in half for the rest of the underpaid animators for less visually demanding episodes. 

Also Gargoyle is such a non factor in these later episodes that it’s hysterical. Like why do you set up a good and threatening villain only to forget about him until the plot starts again. I get if they wanted to take a breather in between major serious plot focused episodes, but can the breather make sense? Also when the gang gets to Africa, Nadia meets this new hot guy that’s takes attention from Jean in Episode 32 of this 39 episode series. That’s why too late to introduce a plot line like that because Jean and Nadia’s relationship has grown too much for that to work. Maybe if that kind of plot line was introduced in one of the first 15 episodes, then it would make more sense and not make Nadia look like an ungrateful brat. Also I don’t think Episode 33 should of brought back Gonzalez, Grantis’s ex, because I think he could represent any greedy person if you’re not careful enough and I think he should of only appeared in Grantis’s flashback instead of making him a forgettable, boring, and generic one-off antagonist for a pretty standard episode all things considered. Also this episode also made me realize that Nadia didn’t learn anything from her relationship growth on the island deeming those island episodes entirely pointless. Episode 34 was honestly kinda decent actually. It’s a musical which I wasn’t expecting. The part where Nadia gets more and more mad when Jean is singing his horrible love song was actually kinda funny. I wished Grantis had a song along Hanson and Sanson, Marie, Jean, and Nadia. I mean Jean was in three songs. Two solos and a duo with Nadia. Also I wished they didn’t just reuse random clips from the previous episodes for the visual for the songs, but hey what can you do, the last five episodes are in sight.

Okay I looked up and the Island episodes were actual filler and the original creator had no control over them. That explains a lot. Also the Nautilus crew returns for the last few episodes without any buildup and they don’t even try to explain how they survived the last time they met or even reference the events of “Electra the Traitor” , the second best episode in the whole show and they brush it under the rug in favor of Evangelion set pieces which are so far removed from the rest of the series that it’s astounding. I was really to give this show a 7/10, but the last two episodes were pretty great. But also do you ever have a perfectly great last episode and just ruin it in the last 5 minutes? Yeah that’s this one. 

It’s revealed that Captain Nemo and Electra had a baby together which is so out of left field and unearned. So I guess plotting against and shooting your captain point blank and actively wanted the demise of his daughter doesn’t mean anything in the slightest and Electra just keeps her current position and the captain doesn’t even think of her differently and acts like that never happened. Also Captain Nemo openly says that he considers himself as a father figure to her and seeing how the rest of the show tries to forget “Electra the Traitor” ever exist, they completely ignore what Nemo said and impregnates the woman who sees him as a father figure. And don’t get even me started with Marie and Sanson. Let me tell you that I liked the pairing of Marie and Sanson, I liked seeing this usually self absorbed guy taking himself down a peg to this toddler and there interactions were really cute. I can tell you without a single doubt that I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT see this 28 year old guy and this 4 year old girl as a ROMANTIC pairing! In the ending when 12 years pass it’s revealed that they got married and Marie is pregnant all while she is still 17… SEVENTEEN!!!!!! Even ignoring the gargantuan elephant in the room, there was absolutely no setup to this they basically just pulled it out of their @$$ just because they wanted a “sent off” without even thinking about the fact the let this scoundrel in 40s in impregnates IN UNDERAGED GIRL!!!! This is probably on the same level of sickening as the Voltron: Legendary Defender sent off by that being disgusting Queer bait and this being outright pedophilia. 

WOW, that got me heated. But it was still a good show overall. The only things I outright despise in this show is Nadia and some moments that straight up feel like their fan servicing minors, but at least it’s wasn’t the focus. Also I more so feel disappointed in the Island filler episodes than activity hating them. I still really like the show overall even despite the major problems I have with it. Maybe down the line I’ll give this show a lower rating as maybe the bad stuff might sink in more overtime. But I am glad I finally watch it.

6036,Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,"Action & Adventure, Animation, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",8.48,"Way too hyped for what it is (like the game before the updates) - cyberpunk anime based on the Cyberpunk universe created by Mike Pondsmith, the anime serves as a prequel to the game and takes place about a year before the events of Cyberpunk 2077. It got the seal of approval by the Polish Developer CD Projekt.

It is set on a future city on California (Night City) in a world where gangs and cybernetic implants are usual. The main ""hero"" (or ""anti-hero"" since it runs a gang in the future on the series) is a cocky latin-american cocky kid with a hard working mother and that gets involved on gangs war, getting implants and changing character through  the series.

Despite the animation being totally Japanese in the form of anime, the main error probably is the main story that the screenplay is based (written by a Polish team)... it is bad written, dumb and previsible and I had zero empathy with the protagonist.  The quality of animation is good, but not phenomenal. 

Action is frenetic but unreal to  the point of being silly and the characters have no realistic traces at all. Maybe because of this I took 1 and a half year to be able to see it all.

The same can be said of the opening music  ""This Fffire"" by Franz Ferdinand probably one of the worst music chosen for the anime by a band already dead in 2023 (it was a more proheminant band from 20y ago).

The leads consistently made choices that were not only repetitive but also pathetic. Almost every character was repeating the same mistakes and facing the same consequences. A group of monkeys would perform and produce a better result under a shock therapy. The side plots were generally bad, maybe only the ML's brother one was acceptable but the rest were kinda cringe. The drama advertised itself around the bigger sister and her younger siblings (as title suggests too) but the siblings played such a small side role in the story while the love triangle was the main focus.

6064,Amazing Stories,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Comedy, Family, Mystery, Crime",7.5,"Steven Spielberg began his diverse career with television. As his star began to rise above the Hollywood sign, he created AMAZING STORIES, an anthology series not unlike THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  Not surprisingly, this new project debuts just a couple of years after his involvement in the doomed TWILIGHT ZONE movie.  The filmmaker would fluctuate his involvement in the series from directing a couple of episodes to story suggestions and plot ideas. No matter what, his influence is felt throughout the run.

The opportunity to work with Spielberg shook the walls of the movie factory.  Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Brad Bird and Robert Zemeckis are just a handful of directors who helmed an episode. Kevin Costner, Carrie Fisher, Kiefer Sutherland, Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito appeared in the series amongst another list of hundreds of A-list performers.

6071,The Rising Of The Shield Hero,"Animation, Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",8.5,"This animation **_The Rising of the Shield Hero_** (_Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari_) is in the isekai genre; meaning modern day person transported (usually by magic) to another plain of reality or another world; typically fantasy based.

This series is exceptionally good.  While there is some liberal based ideas in the series, there isn't a saturation to point of poisoning the audience or putting off the fan base.  The development of the protagonists throughout the series is pretty good and reminded me a lot of another isekai anime called _**Log Horizon**_.  Though instead of following a dozen characters, this anime follows five to six to include the main protagonist, the Shield Hero.    

I wish I could go into detail on how well this series was written but I would mainly be repeating myself.  The pacing, character development, drama, and trauma of all the characters is spot on, and the consistency is flawless.

No no, it will see immune people staying in their suburban neighbourhoods, idling away the time until they meet a friendly neighbour to two. Heck, they might even hook up and have a child, without any risks or complications, you never know.

There wont be issues with packs of hungry dogs, plague rats, piles of rotting corpses spreading disease and infecting ground water, failing infrastructure, unmaintained nuclear energy plants going Chernobyl, not to mention people turning on each other, in a nation where guns are as plentiful as candy.

From its cardboard characters to its cringe-worthy dialogue and moments, the drama failed to maintain an attractive hook, opting instead for a glossy, saccharine portrayal that felt more like a caricature than a digestible imitation. The stories were equally pretty shallow as well, its attempts at drama fell flat, overshadowed by its overwhelming lack of substance, conviction and commitment between most of the characters, relationships and dynamics. Its surface-level approach with everything left no room for any proper investment to be had. By every metric possible, the 2nd season was a significant downgrade to what was an already struggling piece. Yoo Eun Jae was undeniably the weakest link in season 1, recasting her actress to someone who's struggling to play it, made things 10 folds worse. The replacement was trying really hard to mimic the original while the actress facial expressions, fluency and intonations were the polar opposite. It doesn't take a blind man to be appalled by the comparison, not like the original was any better. Unfortunately, things got even worse, her continuous story, background, conflicts, motives, and character writing were a nauseating concoction of utter literary incompetence and creative bankruptcy, a slap in the face to anyone with even a modicum of taste. To be fair, both Ye Ri & Eun Bin brought a much needed improved performances into the 2nd season, their characters as well had a better fit.

And, like Warehouse 13, it walks that line between adult and child perfectly and in the processes creates a show that everyone in the family will be entertained by despite their age.

However, unlike Warehouse 13, Eureka is heavy Science Fiction. It takes a scientific dream community ala Project Y and Los Alamos, only focuses it on a community just as top secret but less ominous, less military, and more family and community orientated than the town that gave us the Fat Man and Little Boy.

And, then it takes all that science, and throws it into the hands of the everyman sheriff to clean up after the experiments go wrong. So it is sort of formulaic, but it is formula with an over-arching seasonal plot, and an overarching series plot that makes it a little more in-depth than the monster of the week fair.

6393,She-Hulk: Attorney At Law,"Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",6.2,"Did not have high hopes for another Marvel TV series as most of their efforts to date have been poor to average at best. Well this falls in that same category as the series seems to again forget what made Marvel films great which was an interesting hero that does not preach and just is just plain fun and interesting to watch and not always the bestest evar hero, but actually has some character arch. Unfortunately Disney has decided not to hire quality writers for this series again as they have already said that they have no idea how to write for a law series, yet they are making a law based comedy (not sure what they have written counts as comedy) series with no knowledge how to write one - and yep that shows in the story. 

The series looks like it has improved the CGI from the trailers, but not by much as still looks rather cheap, especially with our the character, She-Hulk.

The main bright spot of this series is Tatiana Maslany, who is pretty charming and a great actor but unfortunately can not overcome the grim writing and terrible ""jokes"" that weight this series down.

Disney keeps making trash for their streaming platform, so keep yourself from getting angry and 'hulking' out, and avoid this series, try watching a much better written show that wants to entertain like these animated series, Solar Opposites (Disney+/Hulu) or Invincible (Prime). If you are looking for a quality live action Superhero show, then watch The Suicide Squad and then the associated Peacemaker show - both fun and entertaining with quality writing.

If you still want to check out She-Hulk then search out the John Byrne written comic (can probably be found today in either a digital format/platform or in a graphic novel) from the 80's - great progressive story and fantastic artwork makes the Disney+ series look embarrassing compared to the comic - this is what they should have heavily borrowed from to make the TV show shine.","Tatiana Maslany, Ginger Gonzaga, Jameela Jamil, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Josh Segarra","high hop another marvel tv series efforts date poor average best . well fall category series seem forget make marvel film great interest hero preach plain fun interest watch always bestest evar hero , actually character arch . unfortunately disney decide hire quality writers series already say idea write law series , yet make law base comedy ( sure write count comedy ) series knowledge write one - yep show story . series look like improve cgi trailers , much still look rather cheap , especially character , she-hulk . main bright spot series tatiana maslany , pretty charm great actor unfortunately overcome grim write terrible `` joke '' weight series . disney keep make trash stream platform , keep get angry 'hulking ' , avoid series , try watch much better write show want entertain like animate series , solar opposites ( disney+/hulu ) invincible ( prime ) . look quality live action superhero show , watch suicide squad associate peacemaker show - fun entertain quality write . still want check she-hulk search john byrne write comic ( probably find today either digital format/platform graphic novel ) 80 's - great progressive story fantastic artwork make disney+ series look embarrass compare comic - heavily borrow make tv show shine .",1,1
6393,She-Hulk: Attorney At Law,"Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",6.2,"_She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_ at times is some of the better MCU Disney+ content that has come out, but at other times is some of the most bland and boring. Uneven is the best word that I can think of to describe this season. There was no real direction this season was headed and that was a big negative for me. From a rushed origin story that takes up all but one episode and some cringy dialogue sprinkled throughout, the series never found its footing. For a comedy series, I laughed at a couple jokes, but most jokes only received a slight grin from me. Despite those complaints, the show is carried a great performance from Tatiana Maslany. She is so perfect as She-Hulk and her comedic delivery was some of the best in the MCU to date. I really enjoyed how she broke the fourth wall with the audience, but I wish it was used a bit more. I found that the writers would use it maybe once per episode to remind the audience that it is there and then neglect it for the entire episode. The cameos were great, and the series had some fantastic parody of the real world. It was amazing to see the MCU poke fun at its fans and at itself at times. Overall, She-Hulk had some amazing potential but fails to capture any type of momentum fumbling its way to the grand finale, which was awesome and one of my favorite episodes.

6393,She-Hulk: Attorney At Law,"Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",6.2,"_She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_ kicks off with a bang, delivering the kind of goofy, self-aware superhero fun that Marvel’s been missing. Tatiana Maslany is a revelation as Jennifer Walters, effortlessly blending humor and heart in her portrayal of a 30-something attorney who just happens to turn into a giant green Hulk. Whether she’s dealing with legal cases, disastrous dates, or an unexpected supervillain crash-landing into court, Maslany makes every moment shine.

This show leans hard into the comedy, and it works. With its case-of-the-week structure and hilarious cameos, _She-Hulk_ feels like a Marvel series that’s finally comfortable just having fun. It’s light, it’s breezy, and it never takes itself too seriously. And honestly, that’s exactly what makes it stand out in the MCU lineup. You’re not here for world-ending stakes; you’re here to laugh, enjoy some wild guest stars, and watch Jennifer juggle her chaotic personal and professional life.

Yes, the CGI might be a bit spotty at times, but it’s not enough to detract from the show’s charm. If you’re focused on that, you’re missing out on what _She-Hulk_ does best — delivering a fun, witty, and unapologetically feminist take on the superhero genre. The meta humor, especially Jennifer’s direct call-outs to the audience, takes the experience to another level. This is a show that’s in on the joke, and it’s not afraid to poke fun at itself and the fandom.

And speaking of poking fun, the way _She-Hulk_ tackles internet trolls and toxic fandom is genius. It’s not subtle, but it’s exactly what’s needed. Jennifer’s bold, messy, and real, and when she’s shutting down the haters — both in-universe and in real life — it feels so satisfying.

The cameos are another highlight. From Wong to Daredevil, these guest appearances don’t just feel like fan service; they’re seamlessly integrated into the story and add to the overall fun. Madisynn King, portrayed by Patty Guggenheim, steals the spotlight in her brief but unforgettable role. Her bizarre friendship with Wong — or “Wongers” as she affectionately calls him — is a standout moment of the series, and her lines are pure comedy gold.

At its core, _She-Hulk_ is a comedy, and for what it aims to do, it nails it. Sure, it’s not the most groundbreaking series in terms of plot, but that’s not what it’s going for. It’s a refreshing break from the darker, more serious superhero shows out there. The stakes aren’t life or death, and that’s honestly one of its biggest strengths. It’s pure entertainment, with a perfect balance of action, humor, and a little bit of heart.

If you’re looking for a wild, fun, and feminist twist on the superhero formula, _She-Hulk_ is your show. It’s not trying to change the world — it’s here to make you laugh and give you a good time, and in today’s TV landscape, that’s more than enough.","Tatiana Maslany, Ginger Gonzaga, Jameela Jamil, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Josh Segarra","_she-hulk : attorney law_ kick bang , deliver kind goofy , self-aware superhero fun marvel ’ miss . tatiana maslany revelation jennifer walters , effortlessly blend humor heart portrayal 30-something attorney happen turn giant green hulk . whether ’ deal legal case , disastrous date , unexpected supervillain crash-landing court , maslany make every moment shine . show lean hard comedy , work . case-of-the-week structure hilarious cameos , _she-hulk_ feel like marvel series ’ finally comfortable fun . ’ light , ’ breezy , never take seriously . honestly , ’ exactly make stand mcu lineup . ’ world-ending stake ; ’ laugh , enjoy wild guest star , watch jennifer juggle chaotic personal professional life . yes , cgi might bite spotty time , ’ enough detract show ’ charm . ’ focus , ’ miss _she-hulk_ best — deliver fun , witty , unapologetically feminist take superhero genre . meta humor , especially jennifer ’ direct call-outs audience , take experience another level . show ’ joke , ’ afraid poke fun fandom . speak poke fun , way _she-hulk_ tackle internet troll toxic fandom genius . ’ subtle , ’ exactly ’ need . jennifer ’ bold , messy , real , ’ shut haters — in-universe real life — feel satisfy . cameos another highlight . wong daredevil , guest appearances ’ feel like fan service ; ’ seamlessly integrate story add overall fun . madisynn king , portray patty guggenheim , steal spotlight brief unforgettable role . bizarre friendship wong — “ wongers ” affectionately call — standout moment series , line pure comedy gold . core , _she-hulk_ comedy , aim , nail . sure , ’ groundbreaking series term plot , ’ ’ go . ’ refresh break darker , serious superhero show . stake ’ life death , ’ honestly one biggest strengths . ’ pure entertainment , perfect balance action , humor , little bite heart . ’ look wild , fun , feminist twist superhero formula , _she-hulk_ show . ’ try change world — ’ make laugh give good time , today ’ tv landscape , ’ enough .",1,1
6405,"You'Re The Best, Lee Soon Shin","Comedy, Family, Drama",7.2,"**_Not a Romantic Comedy but a Family Relationship Drama_**

_First of all, this series does not qualify as a RomCom (Romantic Comedy) it is a Drama about family relationships. Yes, there are comedy scenes here and there but those scenes were not even 2% of the 1-hour 50 episodes. With that clear, let's begin with the review._

Review proper:
**1. The story.** At first it appeared that this is a story about Lee Soon Shin (played by IU) and Shin Joon Ho (played by Jo Jung Suk), the poster, synopsis, and first few episodes were about them. However, as we enter deeper in the series, it became clear that the series was not about them but about the family relationships.

Shin Joon Ho, and in particular Lee Soon Shin, were only used as an anchor to be able to tell the amazing stories of each of the ""supporting characters"". While this was good overall, without watching the last few episodes, the stories were all over the place. There were too many stories told it was no longer possible to identify which stories qualified as ""main"" and which were ""side"" stories.

All 50 episodes should be watched completely to fully appreciate this series. A series about family relationships. The bond that we share with each other. The ups and downs we go through. The love that still triumphs over resentment and hate.

""You Are The Best"" is about ""YOU"" (yes, YOU the reader) being the best because you fight despite all the trials and tribulations that comes in our lives.

I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 stars.

**2. Acting/cast.** The cast were perfect. The acting they gave to the show were natural, it was as if watching the life of a neighbour or our own. There were no unrealistic acting common in other drama series which is a distraction when watching. Special mention is Kim Hwan Hee for her superb acting, it is rare to see a young kid with that kind of talent in acting. Another special mention is Lee Seul Bi, she should have been given a more active role and more dialogues as she is capable to give the proper emotions and expressions need for her line.

All of them combined, it's 9.5 out of 10 stars.

**3. Music.** It is not easy to grade this one because the emotion-filled drama is far more memorable and powerful. The music were mainly used to be the scene. Meaning, when the music is removed, the scene will not stand on its own. The impact wouldn't be there. The emotion reaction would have been lacking. It would have been better if the scenes with the music can stand on its own--without the music background--because this would've allowed the music to pull out a far more powerful emotional response.

I'm giving this 7 out of 10 stars.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, I'm giving the series 8 out of 10 stars. It was a great show and it was very moving. The multiple main stories are relatable and memorable, especially its focus on family relationships instead of a romcom or romance between two love birds. While having multiple main stories was good, it diminished the focus and impact of the main story between the two main characters. It was also slow at first and took ten to twenty episodes to reach the meat of the main plot. Regardless, the acting given by all the actors and actresses were so good and natural that overall it is worth watching again.","IU, Cho Jung-seok, Goh Doo-shim, Lee Mi-sook, Yoo In-na","* * _not romantic comedy family relationship drama_ * * _first , series qualify romcom ( romantic comedy ) drama family relationships . yes , comedy scenes scenes even 2 % 1-hour 50 episodes . clear , let 's begin review._ review proper : * * 1. story . * * first appear story lee soon shin ( play iu ) shin joon ho ( play jo jung suk ) , poster , synopsis , first episodes . however , enter deeper series , become clear series family relationships . shin joon ho , particular lee soon shin , use anchor able tell amaze stories `` support character '' . good overall , without watch last episodes , stories place . many stories tell longer possible identify stories qualify `` main '' `` side '' stories . 50 episodes watch completely fully appreciate series . series family relationships . bond share . up down go . love still triumph resentment hate . `` best '' `` '' ( yes , reader ) best fight despite trials tribulations come live .

Star Trek: Strange New Worlds throws back to the episodic 'Lesson of the Day' format familiar to and loved by the fans of TOS, TNG, and VOY.

The episodes are written in the same style with somewhat standard plot lines that make the series feel fresh with takes on modern morality and a broad range of character archetypes. Watching the series feels like a welcomed step back in time. Stories can be told in 45 minutes without needing cliffhangers to keep the audience engaged. Character development is well integrated.

Writing this at the end of Season 1 the series has yet to prove itself a more worthy prequel than Enterprise in the question of revisionist history. There are many pitfalls to avoid for any prequel series and so far Strange New Worlds has navigated them with few questionable decisions.

Some folks should not write reviews. Their negativity so obviously reveals their desperate need to sound cultured and knowledgeable; straining to sound relevant  as if they have an opinion that matters because of their vast experience as a filmmaker.  All the while taking a break from playing video games in their mom's basement to try to find problems with a program they streamed.

Each of the Star Trek series had their own personalities, their own charms and attractions, and their own foibles.   The common thread separating them from other sci fi being a fable daring the viewer to think about their preconceptions and the things that they believed are true.   This isn't ""woke"", it isn't preachy.  Its putting a story in front of a shallow, narrow minded audience (like those who use labels like ""woke"" and ""preachy"") and challenging them to first even recognize what's happening and then to think about it and their own world view.

I remember watching the original Star Trek series on my parents black and white tv. 
Each week seemed like another message that challenged my young views and beliefs.  And it seemed that, like now, so many think more about critiquing the medium and never consider the message.  

I've watched and enjoyed to varying degrees all of the trek series (even the animated one!).  This Trek is different.  Its not Next Gen, its not Enterprise, its not DS9 or voyager.  Its not even Discovery even though it seems to have grown from that branch.   No, this Trek is the first one that feels like the original series.  It took nearly 60 years, but i think they finally re-captured the lightening in the bottle that made Gene Roddenberry's ""wagon train to the stars"" so special.

Sadly, like the original Trek, the average shallow viewer focuses on minutia and just doesn't get it.  I fear that, like the original Trek, this one will go the way of the pearl before the swine.   I hope its not the case, because this one, perhaps more than the others that were commercially successful, deserves to go the distance.","Anson Mount, Ethan Peck, Jess Bush, Christina Chong, Celia Rose Gooding","* * * * * folks write review . negativity obviously reveal desperate need sound culture knowledgeable ; strain sound relevant opinion matter vast experience filmmaker . take break play video game mom 's basement try find problems program stream . star trek series personalities , charm attractions , foibles . common thread separate sci fi fable dare viewer think preconceptions things believe true . n't `` wake '' , n't preachy . put story front shallow , narrow mind audience ( like use label like `` wake '' `` preachy '' ) challenge first even recognize 's happen think world view . remember watch original star trek series parent black white tv . week seem like another message challenge young view beliefs . seem , like , many think critique medium never consider message .

6435,Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,Sci-Fi & Fantasy,8.1,"Best Trek Ever!

Strange New Worlds uses the episodic format of the original series, which allows the writers to experiment without locking a whole season into a single story.  While it doesn't shy away from darker themes the show manages to keep a positive tone overall - something that has been lacking in many of the other recent Star Trek series.

The negative reviews are rather funny with their complaints about ""wokeness"" and going on to say how Strange New Words is not like the original series.  They make it clear these doofuses have never actually watched the original.  ST:TOS had a very diverse cast for broadcast television at the time, and many of the episodes were not even close to subtle in terms of message.

For example:

""This Side of Paradise"" (s1e24) had strong themes reflecting the peacenik, hippie ""drop out"" subculture, and psychedelic drug use of the late 1960s.

""The Devil in the Dark"" (s1e25) had a misunderstood enemy who was reacting to the unthinking destruction of their young by humans.

""Friday's Child"" (s2e11) was specifically written to be a story about a strong woman who did not necessarily want children.

""A Private Little War"" (s2e19) was an allegory on the Vietnam War

""Plato's Stepchildren"" (s3e10) included one of the first instances of a kiss between a white man and a black woman.

Strange New Worlds continues the tradition set by the original series of calling attention to societal issues in a science fiction setting.

Half of the above statement is true and the other half is bigoted bullshit. There are numerous successful and acclaimed anime series with female leads going back decades. Ghost in the Shell released in 1995 for goodness sake. The bigotry mind-virus is real and it's rotting people's brains. I truly fear for the future of our species.

As for Terminator Zero - it's boring, contrived, boring, dragged out, boring, and nonsensical. I opted to watch the English version after my last outing with Asian media (Alice in Borderland) left me wondering if the subtitles were just dog !@#$, but even Timothy Olyphant's smooth voice can't save this nonsense. The subtitles don't even match the English sometimes!

Zero takes us to an alternate Terminator reality in which a Japanese AI is built in secret to combat the coming threat of worldwide annihilation by Skynet. Five episodes in and I still have no idea how Malcolm Lee is having these prophetic ""knightmares"". Yes, it is as stupid as it was in the DCEU. Terminator has never had a paranormal or pseudoscience twist to my knowledge. Even Malcolm's AI creation, Kokoro, cannot comprehend his prophetic visions.

The best thing this season has done so far is Kokoro's writing, and maybe that's the ""woke engineering"" MovieGuy whines about, because nowadays, acknowledging the past and how things like poverty and crime and our classist society is all engineered by us to discriminate against those we deem lesser than is too much reality for some to digest. They'd rather cling to notions about gods and their superiority to women and people who don't look or act like them.

I enjoyed Terminator: Salvation and Terminator: Dark Fate. Salvation gave us a look into the future that we rarely see in Terminator media and Dark Fate gave us Mackenzie Davis, a dead John Connor, and an internet full of raging fanboys who couldn't accept it as an alternate story. It also gave us some cringy dialog and Natalia Reyes who just didn't stick the landing with her big future war speech, but I can say that without resorting to bigotry and misogyny. Reeling it back in - compared to these two, Zero is just too boring.

The most fun I've had with Zero is the robot cat and then watching everyone get annihilated at the start of episode 5. It takes 20 seconds, which was 10 seconds too long, but I'll give it a pass. They really wanted you to feel something for those pixel kids.

_Boy, do I miss the days when we understood the need for censorship against irrational hate speech._

---

I'm back with an update! The final two episodes finally answer our burning questions and offer some interesting twists, one of which I hope they don't explore further because it makes ZERO sense. Episode 7 gives us the backstory we should have gotten 4 episodes prior. The writers could have pivoted off of this story and given us something a lot better than what we got. Also, that explanation of MCU time travel was overly convoluted.

If you like Terminator movies, battlestar Galatia/Caprica then this will be a treat.

I saw bits on TV but never could get the story, that's due to the story arc, you have to watch every episode (except 1). There are slow bits but worth watching for the high bits.

S1 is good story character building, each character has back stories or future stories.

S2 really hits the high mark except for 1crap episode.

S3 never happened just when the show found the Awe-factor.

My only con is due to the fact that it is called Sarah Connor Chronicles, some episodes seems like they wrote her into the story just due to the title. Over 60secs of SC talking was a drag especially when JC started to become the stronger character, some parts seemed to be written to try to make SC relevant, towards the end of S2 that didn't fit the story line. Thats why maybe the title worked against the show and should of been more generic like Terminator: the pre-Judgement-Chronicles.

I mean BITTER, I really got into this.  it was entertaining and it felt like it was only just taking off and CANCELED!!!!  That breaks this heart, I wanted at least 4 seasons and a movie.

But, I guess the good things never last. I am going to blame marketing for this, given that I remember hearing about them making a series...and then I didn't even realize what channel it was on until almost the end of the second and final season. So that could be why, but who knows.

The good news is that Sarah Connor completely and totally disavows T3. The story starts with T2 ending the movie canon and believe me we are all greatful for that.

The fact is that Lena Headey pulls off tough really well in this, almost better than...I feel so dirty saying this...but almost better than Linda Hamilton. At least, I liked Headey more in the role. She seemed to balance the mother and the soldier a lot better than Hamilton did--though she had scarce opportunity to do it in the movies.

Summer Glau is the new good Terminator and, for those of you that haven't seen it, she is threatening in this. She is small and thin and really very ominous in her role and given her size, being as believably threatening as she was is just pure talent. There is no way someone with her figure could pull that off without really knowing how to act.

And the cool thing about this is that John Connor--Thomas Dekker--isn't the savior of humanity yet and that was a big draw because even though the movie focuses on his mother, had the series lasted longer we could have seen how he developed into the man that saves humanity form the machines and I really would have loved to see that.

* First, we have season 1 which tells the tale of a criminal mastermind who is doing everything in his power to destroy the centralized power hierarchy known as sybil. 
* Second, we have season 2 which tells the tale of a different villain who is doing everything in his power to destroy... wait (this is oddly similar) ... ah yes, to destroy the centralized power hierarchy known as sybil.

First and foremost, I do recommend you to watch the first season of this show if you like cyberpunk themes, investigation and great characters. The first season is an amazing view at a dystopian future where everything is being controlled and measured, your emotions are constantly being watched by the government, the unrest of the constant surveillance creates discomfort and at worst mental health issues so our main cast has to deal with criminals they could share a future if not careful. The way it develops the villain to be this multi faceted guy who if shone with a different light you might mistake him for the good guy. All characters make sense and there are some twists and turns you clearly don't expect making you sit on the edge of the seat by its grand finale. **Definitely a must watch 10/10**.

Now with season 2... I do NOT recommend you to watch season 2+. Unfortunately, they made some choices in its cast removing main characters, the villain is just cartoonishly evil, then they try to make you feel bad for him by making him tragic when at that point you don't care anymore. Characters don't make sense and their actions at times are plain stupid and incoherent. In the first season what made it so great was that lives had a weight, you just didn't see too many people dying, it was controlled and it gave the show maturity. The second season is a gorefest, bodies exploding, people getting shot out of nowhere, it feels like it was directed by a 12 years old that just recently got out from a twitter fight. The twists and turns the show presents are a joke. One second he wants to kill them all, suddenly in the same episode 2 minutes later he realized his mistakes and does the opposite, without any growth to properly display his change of mind. **Do NOT watch a 2/10** being generous.

TLDR: Season 1 is great, season 2 was made by another guy to milk the cow for all its worth. I haven't watched season 3 but knowing it wasn't made by the original guy I can already tell it has nothing to do with what I fell in love with.","Yuki Kaji, Kana Hanazawa, Yuichi Nakamura, Tomokazu Seki, Takahiro Sakurai","review make part . * first , season 1 tell tale criminal mastermind everything power destroy centralize power hierarchy know sybil . * second , season 2 tell tale different villain everything power destroy ... wait ( oddly similar ) ... ah yes , destroy centralize power hierarchy know sybil . first foremost , recommend watch first season show like cyberpunk theme , investigation great character . first season amaze view dystopian future everything control measure , emotions constantly watch government , unrest constant surveillance create discomfort worst mental health issue main cast deal criminals could share future careful . way develop villain multi faceted guy shine different light might mistake good guy . character make sense twist turn clearly n't expect make sit edge seat grand finale . * * definitely must watch 10/10 * * . season 2 ... recommend watch season 2+ . unfortunately , make choices cast remove main character , villain cartoonishly evil , try make feel bad make tragic point n't care anymore . character n't make sense action time plain stupid incoherent . first season make great live weight , n't see many people die , control give show maturity . second season gorefest , body explode , people get shoot nowhere , feel like direct 12 years old recently get twitter fight . twist turn show present joke . one second want kill , suddenly episode 2 minutes later realize mistake opposite , without growth properly display change mind . * * watch 2/10 * * generous . tldr : season 1 great , season 2 make another guy milk cow worth . n't watch season 3 know n't make original guy already tell nothing fell love .",0,-1

Pretty much every episode without a titan was trash IMHO, but it was simply because I was expecting to see more titans and learn more about them. However, if you look at the series title, it says “Monarch” - this is about people (an organisation), not about titans.

That being said, some story elements were inconsistent, like regular humans surviving a building dropping on their heads and coming out with a “broken” leg that they can walk on without a cane? I've had a broken leg before, and I couldn't walk.

So, regardless of my disappointment about the lack of titans, there were other elements that made this not live up to its potential.

Lastly, a few of the episodes did well in giving the audience an idea of what to expect in the future film, and I'm looking forward to seeing it on the big screen.","Anna Sawai, Kiersey Clemons, Ren Watabe, Mari Yamamoto, Anders Holm","drama action , adventure , sci-fi , good overall build-up come movie . pretty much every episode without titan trash imho , simply expect see titans learn . however , look series title , say “ monarch ” - people ( organisation ) , titans . say , story elements inconsistent , like regular humans survive build drop head come “ break ” leg walk without cane ?

It reminds me of the U.S. show Cagney and Lacey, for those older viewers or those who watch reruns. It features two female partners, one who is a family oriented woman and the other an edgy and impulsive gal. 

The shows have some cases that move through multiple episodes but some plots are wrapped up more quickly. The two detectives have their ups and downs, both on the job and off. They make mistakes, but between the standard police footwork and occasional brilliance, they do okay.

It is a great cast, with the leads Suranne Jones and Lesley Sharp, who I have enjoyed in many roles. They are supported by the excellent Sally Lindsay and Amelia Bullmore. Plus two of the most memorable characters appear in a more limited way, played by Kevin Doyle and Nicola Walker, who are pitch perfect in their roles.

I have read a lot and watched documentaries about polar exploration. I see how this show came about: the author took the skeleton story of John Franklin’s ill fated expedition of the northwest passage, and repurposed it as an original horror story. Cool, I was on board.

And this televised version did a credible job moving the tale to the screen. It is a passable horror story. And then I see near the byline: Based on actual events, or something like that, and I am thinking, why bother with that? Usually a retelling of actual events is at least hanging close to the original tale, not inventing a monster that kills actual historical people in ways other than starvation and scurvy, followed by possible cannibalism. At this point it begs the question, why not just tell this horror story without clinging to the patina of a historical event? (For example, I believe John Franklin died later in the expedition than portrayed here with actor Ciara Hinds. Why?)

Still, my doubts and questions do not detract from the tension and drama of the series.

6803,The Oa,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery, Drama",7.536,"**The OA Is Not For Everyone**

This review is just for the first season, Netflix has renewed it for a second season and it's not hard to see why. Not many shows have generated discussion like this and i think Netflix appreciates a show that has high viewership and large debate.

The debate interestingly isn't just fan theories and character motivations or speculation on whats to come but also whether or not the show sucks. Which goes back to the heading The OA isn't for everyone.

Brit Marling plays Prairie Johnson a blind woman who returns to her home town after resurfacing seven years after being kidnapped with her eyesight restored and now calling herself The OA. From there a genuinely intriguing science fiction/fantasy mystery unfolds through flashbacks alongside some humdrum small town/highschool drama that occurs in the present with the enigmatic Prairie in the middle of it.

I think The OA should be treated like an eight hour movie rather than an eight episode TV show. Whether or not you love or hate the OA won't be up to the first couple of episodes it will really come down to the final five minutes of the final episode **SPOILERS KINDA** which at best is utterly ridiculous or at worst (keeping recent history in mind) downright offensive to some.

Anyone saying this is original has a bad working memory of the Fresh Prince. They recycle so many storylines in this show sometimes multiple old storylines per episode. The only difference is theres no depth and its extra dramatic. The characters have no room to grow and I dont see why or how were supposed to care about any of them. Maybe if this wasn't tied to the fresh prince it could've been original and stood on its own. Really its just bad rehashed fresh prince plots with added drama that feels as fake as the characters.

6861,Pride And Prejudice,Drama,8.2,"I decided to watch this mini-series again after seeing the later movie version, which caused me to realized that maybe I enjoyed that version more. In my memory, I originally had recalled I liked this movie version more. 

And watching this series confirmed that I do like the Keira Knightly movie adaptation more, but only slightly and not to take anything away from this, an excellent series in itself. I will leave it to that prior review to reveal what those small reasons were.

The ensemble cast performs uniformly brilliantly with hardly a misstep. David Barber is an appropriately obsequious Mr. Collins, and Alison Steadman puts in an equally appropriate and cringeworthy performance as the shrill, hysterical and gauche Mrs. Benett. The writing is also mostly very good.

There were a few oddities for me. For example, I am not sure how people drew the conclusion that Jane is demonstrably more beautiful than Elizabeth. I saw no such drop off in looks. For that matter, why on earth were people saying that the cute redhead Mary King was homely? Were redheads devil children or something? But never mind.

I read somewhere that the director of the later movie version set his piece about 20 years before this series was set, to avoid the style of high-waisted dresses. I have to agree with him. These dresses look odd and homely too me, almost like shapeless tube socks rather than high fashion.

Finally, though I have always liked Colin Firth in everything since Circle of Friends, I think the script and/or direction might have overdone it slightly with his constant scowling through the first two episodes. I know it is to make a point of his proud and aloof nature, but later when the housekeeper at his mansion says she has never heard a negative word about him, it made me wonder: how did all of his family, friends and acquaintances avoid seeing that death-scowl of his for all those years?

But that was a minor distraction. Although I like the later movie version slightly better as it turns out, I still enjoy this series and am keeping my DVD copy of it.

Oh, and as a side note, if you have trouble finding the 2005 movie version, you need to search with the dreaded ampersand — Pride & Prejudice —

6861,Pride And Prejudice,Drama,8.2,"**Look no further, in film or TV: this is, so far, the best adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"".**

Whenever a film or television production decides to make a period production, it will always have two major challenges ahead. The first is, obviously, the result of any and all production. The second is the recreation of the historical period, not only in objects, clothes and environments, but mainly in the manners, mentality and habits of those people, of that time, of that culture. That's what historical consultancies are for, and it's an effort that should never be overlooked.

This miniseries was very successful in all these efforts, and for me, it constitutes the best and most reliable audiovisual adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece, a narrative that even those who have never read the original book know perfectly, and which must be one of the most widespread novels in English literature. It is the adaptation where, in addition to having the correct settings and the correct costumes for the time and context, we also have the behaviors and mannerisms that those people, in fact, would have had if they had really existed. And besides, we have an enormous respect and consideration for the written work.

There are several actors who deserve frankly positive attention here: despite being incredibly annoying with her high voice and her tantrums, Alison Steadman gave the Bennet family matriarch a genuine motherly sweetness and affection. Benjamin Whitrow was also very happy in his portrayal of Mr. Bennet, with his more moderate and compromising posture. Jennifer Ehle is very good in the lead role, and Colin Firth is Darcy par excellence (it is no coincidence that the role marked his career so deeply). There are still good supporting performances, coming mainly from Anna Chancellor, Julia Sawalha and Barbara Leigh-Hunt.

Divided into six episodes of about an hour, the series makes good use of the written material and gives the various events the right time to develop. The direction, ensured by Simon Langton, was quite happy with the way he organized all of this, and gave the right pace to the series, without giving in to the temptation to lengthen things excessively in favor of two or three more episodes.

Given its length there was obvious planning issues, the drama hit a major road block at episode 66 and had to hard press the reset button, setting everything back 20 steps. That wasn't enough as the drama, once again, soft hit the reset button at episode 105 and one more time at episode 114 to buy more time. This drama wasn't different from the ones alike it at all but there was a serious drop in overall quality in the second half. It got seriously sloppy and lacked the slightest attention to details. One example is how important scenes are empty, such as the company's 30th celebration had a couple of tables and only the family was there, yet they were delivering a speech as if it was a major event for the entire company. Another one with the investors voting where they showed only one investor. There were many other examples were the drama needed to hire a few random extras to fill some gaps. On a side note, where did Bae Dal Bong disappear? Per usual, character stop showing up suddenly with no explanation has become a normal occurrence with modern daily makjangs.

Such is the case with this ""new"", old series. The original series starring Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell worked in large part, because of the great chemistry and wry humour, these two shared, as much as it was, the shows time travelling adventures.

The reinvention isn't utterly awful but its a long way from being the original.Indeed, aside from the name this show could have been called anything. It bears only a superficial semblance in terms of overriding story.

To my mind, its not helped either by this incessant need, on the part of contemporary entertainment, to push social justice and woke ideologies on the viewing audience. Its not as if we don't notice and speaking for myself and no doubt many others, its tiresome.

It crammed in so much last-minute chaos and then ended with an unsatisfying departure that seemed like an afterthought. There were two things I hated in particular about this drama that were too glaring to ignore and subsequently detracted a lot from the drama, not that it was gonna be something spectacular without them anyway. The gags/comedic-relief moments accompanied by the unpleasant comedy cue made going through the episodes just a tad bit tougher than it already was. The other reason was Sung Ji Hun in general, the man sucks on a cosmic level, both the character and the actor.

The leads had a good characterization and received an equally fulfilling performance by their cast. Which also why the leads had a good dynamic going on. However, its biggest problem is its lack in variety. Since it's a slice of life, the cast felt limited in size while jumping between the same few members of cast. They also lacked a unique variety in their archetypes to help keep the drama lively and vibrant. The same thing can be said about its lacking length of 75min x 16 episodes.

Strangely, her character (Yeo Ji) got demoted to a guest character in the 2nd half, little to no contribution or screen time.

🐽 The story of prosecutor Kang Ho struggling with amnesia and the traffic accident consequences gives a slight feel of Woo Yeong Woo but on a pig farm. It is darker than I expected and lighter than I thought. The cable TV ratings started on 3.6% on the first episode ending with 12% on the final.

This is a big step for Lee Do Hyun acting-wise. I feel like he always looked held back and reserved in past dramas, and The Good Bad Mother is finally the room for him to flourish. He has to play three different states of one character: shrewd cold attractive prosecutor, confused childish Kang Ho in a wheelchair, and a healthy mother's son in the end after all the challenges he's been through. And Lee Do Hyun does it damn well!

🐽 While the criminal storyline is well-waived, the most heartfelt part of the drama is the life in the village and the characters interactions. I couldn't help but rolled on the floor chuckling anytime Sam Shik or the two Woo Byeok secretaries-turned-salad-farmers appeared on screen. (Yoo In Soo needs more recognition, he's hilarious) I also adore the child actors duo of Ye Jin (Kim So Yoo) and Seo Jin (Park Da On). It's never easy to work with kids, especially to get such a sparkling chemistry from 5-6 year-olds.

The ending didn't make me cry neither of sadness nor of happiness, but The Good Bad Mother will remain one of my favorite dramas memorable for its soft humor, attention to details, engaging plot (who killed WHO?!), loveable and energetic characters, and, of course, cute piglets. 🐖

7077,The Acolyte,"Mystery, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",5.583,"_The Acolyte_ brings a refreshing change of pace to the Star Wars universe, blending a murder mystery with horror vibes and featuring a diverse cast. Here's what stood out:

Jodie Turner-Smith's performance was captivating and brought a fresh energy to the series, making her character one of the most engaging. Carrie-Ann Moss, as always, delivered a powerful and compelling portrayal, adding depth and gravitas to her role. Manny Jacinto's charisma and acting skills were a standout, making his character one of the highlights of the show.

The fight choreography was expertly crafted, providing thrilling and dynamic combat scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. The innovative and visually stunning use of Force powers and lightsabers added a unique flair, enhancing the overall excitement. A Wookie wielding a lightsaber is a fan's dream come true, adding an extra layer of excitement and novelty to the series.

However, there were elements that fell short. Vernestra's character felt underdeveloped and directionless, making it hard to connect with her. It would have been more engaging to have Indara in her place. I also struggled to care about Osha and Mae, as these characters failed to evoke empathy or interest, detracting from the emotional weight of the story. Due to the lack of connection with Osha and Mae, moments meant to be tense felt hollow and unimpactful. Certain parts of the script and episode structure lacked the strength to create a fulfilling narrative arc, resulting in a disjointed experience.

Despite these drawbacks, _The Acolyte_ manages to carve out its own identity within the Star Wars franchise. The fight scenes are exhilarating, and the thought put into the story is evident. However, some scenes with CGI don’t feel cohesive with the ADR, and at times, they seem lackluster compared to the rest of the Star Wars franchise.

While there are weak points in character development and script, the series still offers a lot to enjoy for Star Wars fans.

She's gonna reach out and- She also makes scientists go mad and kill themselves by showing them test results she can't possibly have because the tests haven't even been run yet. She's either a prophet, a psychic, or she's a sexy time-traveling space goddess here to eat your giblets.

7208,My Liberation Notes,Drama,7.639,"The cinematography and visuals were great although they went overboard with tilted shots and angles, surpassing their creative limits. The drama had a decent melodic score that blended with the shots just okay but no particular track stood out. Enough technicality, no matter how I look at it, the drama boiled down to be a cheap mix between Thirty-Nine (2022) & My Mister (2018), lacking soul and a unique identity. The self narration bits were a hit or miss, some lines were brilliant and fit the mood, while others were just nonsensical pretentious scribbles. There was a good opportunity to give these narrations to other characters as well but these were mostly done by Yeom Mi Jung. The end of episode 2 made it seem like a tacky show in a fancy wrapping, signaling that it wouldn't stay grounded and would resort to impractical moves to progress the plot forward and grab attention. This is one thing the drama constantly kept contradicting itself with. I didn't like their approach for the ending; they should've just wrapped it up instead of sneakily dancing around it for way too long. Don't excuse its shortcomings by calling it a slow show. Both the writer and director have succeeded in creating slow shows before, but this one missed the mark and sacrificed other important elements along the way. Even with a very relaxed 16 episodes, most of the characters didn't get the development they deserved, but I guess some slice of life scenes were more important. That one major transition around episode 13-14 was embarrassingly poorly done and was a real cowardly move by the writer to escape the writer's block. It left an unerasable stain for what could've been a decent show.

7217,The Tale Of Nokdu,"Comedy, Drama",7.1,"Initially, it stood out by highlighting a predominantly female perspective of resilient women thriving independently, offering a glimpse into a world of contentment among a backdrop of mostly antagonistic male characters. However, the typical romantic entanglement, took a central role in a heartbeat as it featured two inexplicably infatuated men competing for the affection of a seemingly unremarkable woman, creating an appalling surreal cycle of rejection and groveling. This toxic dynamic became overwhelming and off putting, tainting the entire drama. The drama stumbled when merging this with a weary political subplot that ended up being unnecessarily cluttered. On another note, the cross-dressing gimmick at the beginning was nothing but a waste of time and a blatant cash grab. At the very least, it should have served as an element to help the characters bond but it didn't.

7268,Black Bird,"Drama, Crime",8.1,"[Minor Spoilers]

So, I watched the entire show today.  I have to say it was one of those stories you just couldn't leave lying.  I had to finish it.  To put it briefly, it was an incredibly solid true crime Tv Show.  Highly reminiscent of True Detective and Mindhunters.  Right up there in the same caliber.    

I don't think it was better than Mindhunters, but I do think it was better than True Detective S1.  So that is where I stand.

Now this show was great.  It lacked some details about the main character I would have liked, they never really explored him.  I never really felt like I got to know him.  Even when he was telling the antagonist it didn't feel genuine, and I don't think it was supposed too anyway.  He was lying very often to garner the thing he needed from the antagonist.
Perhaps the highlight of the show would be the character of Larry Hall, played surrealistically by Paul Walter Hauser.  Who said he was incredibly happy to be able to work with Ray Liotta, who passed during the filming of this show.  Paul's acting elevated to an entirely new level.  He continues playing the soft-spoken innocent guy mostly, until he can't help but show his true dark side.  It's uncanny how well Hauser did.  Definitely reminds me of Mindhunters and Ed Kemper's actor.  

There is a sense of being played with by the antagonist throughout the show that makes you feel like the main character, being toyed with almost.  
I suppose the rest of the show wasn't really too standout.  It was shot well.  Especially the episode before the finale.  The director really nailed the tension in that beginning scene with the therapist.  I suppose the show stands out as 4 stars to me because I couldn't drop it all day.   I suppose I should change the rating to 3.5 to better reflect that its certainly above average but perhaps not in Zodiac (fincher) territory.

If it's a question about these filmmakers talents?  It has been answered.  Solid, Solid show.  It felt a little rushed at the end in that last episode but ok.  

Really recommend it.  My particular bent for this type of story is that the Antagonist really makes me wonder why God creates serial killers.

There is a line in a Koan poem by a Zen monk, that I was reminded of while watching it.   Thich Naht Hanh wrote it.

7302,Strangers From Hell,"Mystery, Drama",8.1,"I'm going to start by saying I have always been way more of a thriller or action drama kind of person rather than a romance drama (although I do love _True Beauty_).

I initially was going to rewatch Shinsuke Sato's _'Alice in Borderland'_ for the 4th time, but I said to myself- watch something new. I was scrolling through the Kdramas on Netflix, and this one popped up. It's been on my watchlist for a while now but I have just never got around to watching it. 

I think this series is absolutely fantastic at drawing in the watcher right from the beginning. The intro to the first episode was so captivating as it started at the end. Im Si-Wan's character, Yoon Jong-Woo, is possible one of the best-written characters in the entire series (which is expected of the protagonist), one of my favourite things about this character is his relationship with all the other characters, and we get to see both sides of what he is thinking during conversations.
For instance, we see that Jong-Woo wants to cause bodily harm to his boss Shin Jae-ho, but he doesn't. This character trait of Jong-Woo shows the watcher that he is more similar to Moon-Jo (the primary antagonist) than both he and the watcher wishes to believe.

The true beauty of this drama for me is that it plays with the watcher almost as much as it plays with Jong-Woo. We grow to empathise with Jong-Woo so much as the filmmaking shows us every single aspect of his situation and the way other characters feel towards Jong-Woo.
One of the most interesting characters for me was Yoo Gi-Hyeok (portrayed by Lee Hyun-Wook) as we never got to know him. We very briefly got to know the character before he was killed off by Moon-Jo (who at this time, we also knew very little about). I had many questions left unanswered like:
Why was he such an intimidating character?
Why was he portrayed to be such a subtly tyrannical figure in the commune?

This series created so many amazing unforgettable characters- as I was watching this series, my favourite character changed almost every single episode- flicking mainly between Yoo, Jong-Woo, Moon-Jo and Kang. I really want to focus this review not just on the storyline but the character writing as I feel like that was the true show-stealer, no series maybe apart from _Alice in Borderland_ has ever drawn me in through the characters as much as this one has. That's what makes a series good. No unforgettable.

No small amount of irony in that title. The one thing this series doesn't do well, is move the story forward. Its molasses slow, painfully pedestrian and largely devoid of excitement.  

The preview for this thing is completely at odds, with what's actually on offer. That amounts to a dreary school/teenie drama with the faintest hint of a action/superhero series.

7369,The Idol,"Drama, Soap",5.4,"The sex is heterosexual.  Depp is an attractive woman that is portrayed as an attractive woman.  It opens with a discussion on a nudity rider that is going against the lead character's will coming from an effeminate man that looks Woke AF and a selfie with a, well, a shot.

Furthermore not all the good guys are people of color, not all the bad guys are straight white men and it does a really good job of making the industry look as horrible and scummy as it is.

The fact is, that all of that has been so censored out today that a woman playing an attractive woman as an attractive woman seems... shocking.

But if Depp played an ugly lesbian this entire thing would have been ""empowering.""

At the end of the day it's exactly the sort of thing that film needs.  We need a film, a TV show, that breaks down the self-imposed political censorship.  The Idol does just that and I look at it as a positive step in the right direction, we need more media to force it's way through that crap so we can get back to making media that is actually good again.

This isn't exactly Chinatown, but it is a step away from making pure political propaganda and a step towards making films to entertain again.  And the more we have crap that pushes back against it, the closer we get to pop culture for the sake of entertainment again.

Let's face reality... It criticizes the music industry, so people are going to hate it.  Depp is an attractive woman who gets naked, so people are going to hate it.  The Weekend is a man that has heterosexual sex with her, so people are going to hate it.  It calls out Hollywood, so people are going to hate it.

People compare it to Showgirls, and that's not accurate, it has a lot more depth than Showgirls, it is satirical of a lot more than Showgirls ever was.  It points more fingers.

If Depp played a lesbian, and if it supported and said bright and happy things about the Music and Film industries, people would praise it.  Because it doesn't, because it's political and people are obligated to hate on it.

7395,The Old Man,"Action & Adventure, Drama",7.22,"A great cast in a decent series but not one without limitations. Whats very likeable about this series, is, in a sense, also its key shortcoming. 

Jeff Bridges who plays the main character a wanted CIA spook, is possessed of a downbeat, affable quality that belies the mans deadlier qualities. The result is when he is forced to transition from one persona to the other, its a discordant experience. This is, I suspect, just what the writers wanted and its a ploy that works beautifully. The harsh transition from harmless and friendly to fierce, captures your attention and holds it. 

Its also what does not work so well. The old man stereotype with a range of ailments, popping pills and walking stiltedly, is overplayed. So much so, that it somewhat undermines the deadly assassin alter ego. You start asking how a man portrayed as this enfeebled, could take on and defeat trained men half his age? Of course, in hand to hand he probably couldn't and whilst this is suggested, at the same time the series is still pushing this premise. The presence of two attack dogs is supposed to help explain this away too but in actuality, their actions, create, at times, implausible plot holes.  

This series would have worked a little better is the ""old geezer"" aspects of the character had been downplayed a little more and the mans years of training and experience, was given more emphasis.

That said, there is a hell of lot more to like here than not. Its an enjoyable romp, that's comes armed with decent writing and as I said, a  great cast. Action is well paced and the improbable elements of the story don't stop it from being fast paced and enjoyable.

The first season was filmed in Hawaii and gave a more realistic representation of Vietnam, sequential seasons were filmed in California to cut costs and make it easier for production. 

While the first season has more ""in the bush"" footage because of location, the second and third season focus more with ""On Base"" and ""Real World"" issues that the war brought on.

Each character is lovingly detailed and their back story explained. Sometimes you wish you had a little more time with one character or the other in an episode but the following picks up with that character to get a feel for who they are.

Mid season 2 a few new characters are brought in which generally don't mix well with the season 1 vibe. It started to turn to a drama and love story between a few main characters and less on war. Then the next episode was back to war and the tragedies of it.

It was like last week I saw season 1, good to see the proceeding. Yeah, the story moves on, but it was totally different than the first. The initial setup was a road trip, then in the middle of the season, it settled down where the remaining story took place.

After knowing the god is missing, Jesse the preacher along with his two friends embark to find him in various places. They come close yet unreachable. Besides, they go through a lot. A lot of obstacles, particularly the Saint of Killers was the most interesting aspect. Then there's an old man who adds the other interesting fact. Don't believe how he had ended, because they did not show that shot properly. So expect a surprise in the follow up.

On the other side of the tale, there's hell. Eugene, who has been stuck in the hell reveals his side of the struggle. He meets the most recognised historical figure. I mean in the hell, who could be it. I thought this perspective was unnecessary, but it made sense as the overall season was unfolded, Especially when it had ended, it left a big clue what might come in the next season.

It messed up her character value in one way or another. All of the characters that were in position of power were delusional and gullible which is exactly what the drama was built on. This is a cheap way to create melodrama to drive the drama, it's fundamentally annoying no matter how they spin it and justify it. So don't expect any clever plays by these samples. The drama clearly lost focus by the end. The writer wrote the story into a corner after a very long, repetitive and tiring melodrama and didn't have much to show for the ending so they resulted in throwing new events to have an ending rather than having both events running in parallel. How historical accurate that last portion was is irrelevant if it was presented with poor storytelling. This wasn't an enjoyable watch.

The show has a promising start, with a hint of alleged “true story”. 

Some of the episodes are good. But after the episode 3-4, the protagonist makes so many foolish mistakes that I literally lost sympathy for him. He is like extremely tormented, feared, annoyed because of his stalker, and at the same time does all the brainless things e.g. follows her to her home, goes on a date with her, gives her mixed messages, and even sleeps with her. 

Sorry dude, you lose all my vote after this. The show also ends with a mixed message, something like the perpetrator is also a victim, and so on. Well, based on this logic every criminal has some sob story. That doesn’t justify a bad behavior by any means.

But he lets Bryson goad him into trying to match or improve on his impressions. I had to remind myself these are fictional versions of themselves. Meaning it is probably a realistic glimpse at their friendship, but not really them. For example, Brydon’s wife who sends him off one season is an actress, not his real wife. So does that mean that Coogan isn’t a ladies man and shallow in some ways? Who knows? Just sit back and let it roll over you.

Interview with the Vampire, for me, largely misses the mark on each and every count.The characters don't feel like the Rice's, they lack the personality and finesse, she infused her characters with. The time period/setting is in many respects, off the mark, too. 

Worse still, there's is politic's infused into this work. There's a dash of rather obvious negative Russian messaging and yet more woke-ism, I personally, could have done without. 

Acting is of a high standard. I feel its a genuine shame so much else is off. This could have worked if they had paid closer attention to Rice's actual work and knocked off the unwelcome messaging. 

In short, high production values and decent acting can't save this series from feeling, to this fan at least, nothing like Rice's work.

7498,Interview With The Vampire,"Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",7.426,"So this is one of those titles that IMDb will remove your review if it's not positively glowing.

I'm not sure why, the source material was already really progressive.  It was essentially a story about two Gay men who happen to be vampires... and their violent break up.  But it was subtle, it was artistic, and it had more of a story to tell about good and evil among other things.

Subtle is the key, because in the 2022 version, there is nothing subtle or artistic.  Vampires can't have sex in the novels to up the sexual tension and angst.  In this title I guess they didn't think it would be woke enough if it wasn't 9 and 1/2 Weeks with Vampires. 

And then they changed Louis, which means that they had to change the entire timeline of the title, and that caused a little bit of complications with everything else, because even though there was a strong message about freeing his slaves in the book... they couldn't have it in the movie...

...Because when you are woke things don't need to make any sense.  

And they aged Claudia up, and that presented significant changes and relieved some of what made her character so compelling.

7554,Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-Sin,Drama,2.5,"It started off with a big war and lots of action. Ships, canons, battles and massacres, but that was only for the first 5-6 before dialing back the clock to the very beginning of the ML's childhood days and turning the drama into a massive snoozefest. That was a massive bait to hook the viewers in. It took 1 singular eternity before the drama managed to pick itself back up. The entire first half was the admiral backstory with little to no action. You don't get to see the admiral in action and you don't get to see what the drama promised until the second half which is way too delayed to stick around for. The production value is acceptable when taking into account that this was made 20 years ago. It's a bit scuffed but they had to work with what they had. It wouldn't matter much because that only shows with the action/battle scenes of which there were only a few (out of the 104 episodes). One of the most jarring things that is holding the drama back, aside from the aforementioned points, is its characters. A lot of characters got benched regularly regardless of their importance, relevance and prior investment. Making emotional scenes less impactful and key characters less memorable. Which also takes away from every climax and transition period. This is due to a combination of uneven pacing, long runtime, and frequent transitions. By the end, it seemed everyone was expendable, other than the male lead of course.

Title: An incredible achievement in capturing that fleeting moment in young love when all seems infinite until it isn't and ""controlling the distance"" in life and sports

This series is one of the most moving coming of age stories I have watched in my life. In my opinion it should be viewed by a more mature audience of 30+, as most of the second half takes place in that bitter-sweet spot where life is no longer filled with possibilities but where youth is still close enough to be seen through a lens colored in a less pinkish hue than the first time around and properly analyzed in order to go on towards middle age and beyond. 

Kim Tae Ri gives life to one of the most memorable characters I have ever seen in film or TV (I am including here all that Hollywood has ever done).

Animations are (always) underrated for the majority, but if I could offer you _(non-animation consumer)_ **ONE** contemporary animated production to watch, it’d be Pantheon. But to be fair and even more accurate on my recommendation, this is a show for whom: 
1. Loves SciFi and is still wondering if we all live in a simulation. 
2. Like to catch Easter eggs here-and-there. 
3. Is opened to deeper reflections about the future and its endless possibilities.

There are two seasons, the first is focused on the action and building the characters. The second is way more Philosophical and by the end of it you may need some time to digest its storytelling.

I enjoyed its earlier episodes but it kept repeating the exact same gags with every single episode. How many times they repeated the same kitchen/cooking gags? I don't understand how they thought that would work. The cast size was limited as well, it could've definitely helped in coming up with new material. However, its biggest flaw was trying to add plot to its bare-bone formula. It's one of the rarest sights to see this level of shameless attempts. They didn't even know how to include it so they dedicated separate episodes for it in the middle parts while reallocating the comedy to different episodes separately, again.

7672,The Girl I Like Forgot Her Glasses,"Animation, Comedy",7.8,"SLIGHT SPOILERS: I go into some detail here so if you want to go in blind, then do not read.

Quite liked this one. Komura is very, shall we say, kawaii from his nervousness and raging crush on Mie. He wants what's best for her, always trying to help, and keeping his expectations from rising too high so that his feelings aren't hurt from potential rejection. He is always second-guessing himself, wondering if he acted the right way whenever he interacts with Mei. He reminds me of myself during early high school when I had a raging crush, nervous whenever she was near, and always worried if I did something wrong.

Mei, just gotta say, is also quite adorable. Whenever she gets super close to Komura, she acts as if it is normal because it is normal for her. It's a pretty funny gag at times whenever she has to stare very closely at her books, Komura, etc. She also feels a sense of responsibility and awareness of how her poor vision affects others. She feels like she can be a drag to people whenever she forgets her glasses, making her feel helpless and that she can't do things ever on her own.

I mostly like the scenes where there is a progression of Komura and Mei's relationship and how the dynamic is developed. Komura always wanting to help Mei is reciprocated by Mei wanting to pay him back for all his kindness. I also find her developed desire of wanting to see Komura's face quite interesting. She says it is calming and makes her feel more at ease, and it is quite funny whenever Komura is bright red at each face-looking session. And I find it fitting ending the season with the selfie Mei took with Komura, with her glasses of course. 

There were some things that I didn't find helped with the show. To start, there are episodes mostly in the middle that feel like filler where I feel Mei and Komura's relationship makes no progress and only exists as entertaining and comedic scenes. It's just scenes of random misunderstandings, awkward situations, and overly prolonged dialogue that don't serve a real purpose. 

Secondly, there are scenes in which some really stupid stuff happens to the point where I am frustrated with the characters. Komura constantly makes mountains out of molehills that have extremely simple solutions. And he makes very odd decisions, such as when he comes across the confession scene. Rather than turn back or hide behind the wall he just popped out of, he runs across to the tree on the other side. Why? probably just to have the scene where he pulls Mie into his arms. Cute, but what happened before to get us here is quite stupid.

Lastly, the standard anime moans, grunts, and non-word human noises are quite excessive in this one, especially from Mei. It's like every visual that is shown of Mei has her making some continuous sound, and it becomes quite annoying. Why does Anime feel the need to have a sound for any time a character is on screen that doesn't talk in the moment? You don't have to do that you know.

But alas, I still liked it and probably will buy the Manga at some point to see where the story goes.

At first, I didn't think I would like this show for three reasons

2. I did not like Ariana Grande at the time.

- Stephen King; _The Outsider_ (2018)

If you ever wondered what the first season of _True Detective_ might have looked like had the merely-hinted-at supernatural elements become more than merely hinted at, then _The Outsider_ gives you a possible answer. Starting as a grim and gritty police procedural, the show takes a left turn in the third episode, before diving head-first into the supernatural in the sixth and seventh. And do these two tones mix well? Kind of. The early episodes are easily the strongest, and as the hokey horror elements start to take over, the foreboding portentousness of those beautifully constructed episodes gives way to Stephen King-isms. Relatable themes such as guilt and the paralysis of grief are dropped in favour of larger (and thus more abstract) issues such as the infectious nature of evil and the ability of ordinary people to band together in extraordinary circumstances (as I said, it's King-101). But for all that, and despite the not entirely successful mixing of genres, I enjoyed the show. I hadn't read the novel, and so I was genuinely invested in finding out where all of everything led. And even though the journey (the early stages, in particular), proved more interesting than the destination, it was a journey that I don't regret taking.

Cherokee City, Georgia. When the badly mutilated corpse of a young boy, Frankie Peterson, is found in the woods, homicide detective Ralph Anderson (the always excellent Ben Mendelsohn) immediately launches an investigation. Partnered up with Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Yunis Sablo (an understated Yul Vazquez), within a few hours, it appears the murderer has been identified, with multiple witnesses reporting seeing local little league coach and school teacher Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman) covered in blood near the scene of the crime. When physical evidence and surveillance footage further point to Terry's guilt, a bull-headed Ralph, who is still grieving the death of his son several years prior, has Terry arrested in front of the whole town. As Terry's wife, Glory, (a suitably frazzled Julianne Nicholson) and his lawyer, Howie Solomon (Bill Camp; as good as he always is), scramble to understand what has happened, Terry maintains his innocence, saying he was at a teaching conference in another state on the day of the murder. And it doesn't take Solomon's investigator Alec Pelley (Jeremy Bobb) long to locate footage of Maitland at that conference. But how can one person be in two places at once? Such is the intriguing hook with which the show begins.

Airing on HBO, and based on the 2018 novel by Stephen King, the show was adapted for TV by acclaimed novelist Richard Price (_Clockers_, _Freedomland_, _Lush Life_, and a veteran of HBO dramas _The Wire_, _The Night Of_, _The Deuce_). Showrunners/executive producers include Price and Jason Bateman (who also co-stars and directs the first two episodes, establishing the _Ozark_-esque aesthetic template). Novelist Dennis Lehane (_Gone Baby Gone_; _Mystic River_; _Shutter Island_) also contributes scripts for two of the later episodes. Other characters include Jeannie Anderson (an exceptional Mare Winningham), Ralph's wife; Claude Bolton (Paddy Considine, excellent despite struggling with an American accent), manager of a local strip club; Jack Hoskins (a ferocious Marc Menchaca), a self-destructive and volatile homicide detective; Holly Gibson (Cynthia Evro), a recurring character in King's recent novels, best described as a pseudo-paranormal investigator; Andy Katcavage (Derek Cecil), a former homicide detective; Seale Bolton (Max Beesley), Claude's brother; Tamika Collins (Hettienne Park), homicide detective; and Kenneth Hayes (Michael Esper), Georgia DA.

If the show has a singular standout element (aside from the excellent ensemble cast), it's the aesthetic design. Bateman, who has directed multiple episodes of _Ozark_, establishes a dark and gritty tone in the first two episodes, imbuing every shot with a foreboding sense of unease. Shadows abound; bright colours are muted, with greys and washed-out blues dominating; characters are often shown isolated in long shot, framed in doorways, or pushed into corners; depth of field is often extremely shallow; camera movements are methodical and slow; the editing is non-linear enough to keep the narrative slightly off-kilter (although this non-linearity is confined primarily to the first two episodes and the opening of episode nine); there's even a split-diopter used at one point to keep the foreground and background in perfect focus. The show looks every inch an HBO prestige crime drama. There are also some nice directorial flourishes. For example, in the last episode (directed by Andrew Bernstein), as the good guys are moving through a cave, they pass a body of water and we see the villain's eyes non-diegetically reflected in the water, taking up almost all of the screen's real-estate. Sure, it's not subtle, but it looks damn good.

Perhaps the most noticeable aesthetic element is the discordant score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans, which helps the atmosphere, tone, and pacing immeasurably. Music cues are often just one deep note, held and elongated for up to two or three seconds. Oftentimes, entire scenes will be scored to these singular notes, giving whatever is on screen a sense of portentousness beyond the purely visual.

For all its aesthetic gymnastics, however, the show does have some problems both stylistic and narrative. For one thing, it's too long; eight episodes would have been more than sufficient to tell this story, and the narrative really starts to drag in episodes five and six. It picks up again in eight (which is largely a character-focused episode), but there's just not enough material to fill 10+ hours. There's also the genre-mixing mentioned earlier. What starts as a tough cop investigating a grisly murder morphs into a quirky paranormal sleuth chasing down an ancient evil, and as these two vie for space, neither genre feels fully developed. The early episodes are creepy and unnerving, with tone and atmosphere doing the heavy lifting. But as the show goes on, the horror becomes broader and less effective, and Price is never really able to fully yoke these two disparate elements into a cohesive whole.

Other problems (presumably) come from the source text, such as the first solid transition into the supernatural, which is based on a coincidence so preposterous that I was convinced the show would return to it to offer an explanation (it does not). There's also the merry band of blue-collar salt-of-the-Earth types who band together to face something beyond any one of them, a trope that King has done to death by this stage.

All in all though, I enjoyed _The Outsider_ for the most part. It has significant problems, but it does a lot right. The aesthetics and acting help a hell of a lot, and although it's far from the best King adaptation ever made (that would remain Frank Darabont's _The Green Mile_), it's a damn sight better than recent efforts such as Andy Muschietti's two _It_ films and (shudder) Nikolaj Arcel's _The Dark Tower_.","Ben Mendelsohn, Cynthia Erivo, Bill Camp, Jeremy Bobb, Julianne Nicholson","* * _starts strong narrative weaken show progresses_ * * > tuvo todo el mundo en poco ; > fue el espantajo el coco > del mundo , en tal coyuntura , > que acreditó su ventura > morir cuerdo vivir loco . - miguel de cervantes ; _el ingenioso caballero quijote de la mancha_ ( 1615 ) > reality thin ice , people skate whole live never fall end . fall , help . - stephen king ; _the outsider_ ( 2018 ) ever wonder first season _true detective_ might look like merely-hinted-at supernatural elements become merely hint , _the outsider_ give possible answer . start grim gritty police procedural , show take leave turn third episode , dive head-first supernatural sixth seventh . two tone mix well ?

I wasn't sure that I would like this at first based on the first episode, but I wanted to finish it and overall I found the show entertaining and funny.

This compared to other anime I have watched recently is definitely way more exaggerated, over the top, and relies more on the comedy than other aspects of the show to appeal to the audience. I know it is a trope for anime to over exaggerate what would be normally a calmer situation, but with this one they pump it up more than what I am used to. The show knows the plot is pretty silly and revels in it by trying to make it more comedic. I feel in general that is what this show does. When characters make odd/silly decisions, when something ridiculous happens in the plot or something else like such, the show is very aware and just revels in the ridiculous situation to make it more funny. I think, for the most part, it succeeded. I feel the show is asking for the whole situation to not be taken as seriously. I also am glad that the show was not as predictable as I was worried it would be. I was thinking based on the cover that the main character would get a third and fourth girlfriend and so on, but it actually went another direction that I was happier with.

In regards to complaints, I would say that really no one in the story has much an arc. Sure, they have some up and downs and maybe very tiny arcs within a subplot, but for the most part the characters are the same throughout and don't go through any real change. The show does I think try to make up for it with again it's comedy and entertainment value, which I think is more what this show is for.

7789,Ekaterina,"Drama, War & Politics",8.258,"Season 1. This might better be called ""Elizaveta"" as it focusses more on the reign of the daughter of Pyotr the Great as Empress of all the Russias. Yuliya Aug ably portrays this shrewd and calculating woman who has realised that her nephew and heir Pyotr (Aleksandr Yatsenko) isn't quite the full shilling, but nevertheless must succeed her if the Romanov dynasty is to continue. To that end she picks a princess from a small German principality to marry the man and so enter the timid Princess Sophia (Marina Aleksandrova). She arrives with her mother (Isabel Schosnig) and is soon getting used to a deferential court rife with machinations and schemes whilst learning to appreciate that her potential marriage to a man at best indifferent to her is going to present challenges. With the Empress becoming more and more frustrated that a pregnancy isn't manifesting, the first series depicts the precarious existence of the now Grand Duchess Ekaterina as she learns to tread adeptly on the eggshells around her. Her increasing desparation to avoid the vengeance of Elizaveta and a life in a remote Siberian convent sees her develop skills of ingenuity that, with the tacit complicity of the Empress, see her turn to the dashing Prince Saltykov (Rinal Mukhametov) and next thing there's a Prince called Pavel and a Grand Duke called Pyotr taking the plaudits for something in which he most definitely didn't have an hand. The Empress has all she wants and so the rest of the series sees out her reign and the start of that of the new Czar Pyotr III who has his new mistress Elizaveta Vorontosva (Anastasia Korolokova) in tow and wishes to be shot of his now inconvenient Empress. It's all history this, so little room for jeopardy. What it does provide us with is a sumptuously staged drama depicting a speculative glimpse of life at a Russian Imperial court where life firmly revolved around the person of the Empress. The characterisations are solid with a strong performance from an Aleksandrova (who did remind me often of Rebecca Ferguson) and though the pace does get a bit soapy to pan out ten episodes when probably eight would have done, it keeps moving engagingly. The narrative concentrates more on the domestic goings-on rather than really developing the state of the kingdom's international affairs and conflicts, so that means it's opportunity to develop the other prominent characters from this time - ""Potemkin"" (Vladimir Yaglych); Bestuzhev (Vladimir menshov) and latterly Orlov (Artyom Alekseev) is limited and they  don't really make much impact.

7803,Love Is Deep,"Comedy, Drama",7.5,"The main characters are intended to be Ding Ding and Ning Wei Jin, but there are so many people in it, each with their own love story, that the storyline becomes too broad. Perhaps this is also why the episodes in this series are so long. As a fan of this series, I believe that the story of Ning Wei Xuan and Gao Ren is more intriguing to watch than the story of Ning Wei Jin and Ding Ding.

This, however, does not make the series a terrible one. Despite the fact that some critics have stated that this series is not very excellent. However, I believe that this series is worth attempting to watch.

It took three full episodes just to do a basic introduction as stated in the synopsis, only then, the story somewhat started. Earlier in the second half, the drama reached a point where things were about to get interesting but it suddenly hard pressed the reset button on everything. The writer was genuinely not even trying, she worked on The Beauty Inside (2018) previously which was decent but what is she even doing here?

Subsequently, themes of death, mortality, grief and fate were poorly injected and remained half-baked. The unusual romance was justified by using a blend of these themes but it didn't make sense or click. Even then, it created a big disconnect when it reached its highest moments. However, it wasn't as bad as the secondary couple romance, which gave us a despicable characterization of the characters Joo Ik, Hyun Gyu and Ji Na. Their relationship didn't fit the story, narrative and themes. It had no thoughts put into it and adding it was a mere useless filler.

8026,Wind Breaker,"Animation, Action & Adventure",8.2,"""Wind Breaker"" is a captivating anime that has managed to grab my attention and keep me eagerly awaiting each new episode. From the start, this series has shown great potential, and I believe it is living up to that promise exceptionally well. As of now, with eight episodes released, it has proven to be a standout in its genre, thanks to its impressive fight choreography, stunning graphics, and well-developed characters.

One of the most striking aspects of ""Wind Breaker"" is its fight scenes. The choreography is simply outstanding, with each battle meticulously planned and executed. The fluidity of the movements, the strategic use of the environment, and the sheer intensity of the encounters make for a thrilling viewing experience. The animation quality is top-notch, bringing these high-octane scenes to life with vibrant colors and detailed character designs. It's clear that a lot of effort has gone into making each fight sequence as visually spectacular and engaging as possible.

The graphics in ""Wind Breaker"" deserve special mention. The attention to detail in the backgrounds, the dynamic camera angles, and the overall aesthetic of the show contribute to its immersive quality. Whether it's the bustling streets or the quieter moments of introspection, the visual elements of the anime are consistently impressive. This high level of artistry helps to draw the viewer into the world of ""Wind Breaker"" and makes each episode a visual treat.

The cast of ""Wind Breaker"" is another area where the anime shines. Often in action-oriented series, side characters can feel like mere filler, existing only to support the main protagonist. However, this is not the case here. Each character, regardless of their role, is given a distinct personality and, importantly, a unique fighting style. This diversity in character design and behavior adds depth to the story and keeps the interactions fresh and interesting.

Initially, I was concerned that ""Wind Breaker"" might lack a substantial storyline, focusing solely on action and fight sequences. However, my fears were quickly dispelled as the episodes progressed. The narrative has developed significantly, weaving in character backstories and motivations that enrich the overall plot. This growth in character development is particularly noteworthy. Each episode peels back another layer of the characters, revealing their complexities and making them more relatable and engaging.

The main character, in particular, has shown remarkable growth. Starting as a somewhat typical protagonist, he has evolved into a multifaceted character with a compelling journey. His interactions with other characters and his personal struggles add emotional weight to the series, making it more than just a series of well-executed fight scenes. The supporting characters are also given their moments to shine, with their own arcs and development that complement the main storyline.

Without delving into spoilers, I can say that ""Wind Breaker"" has managed to create a narrative that balances action with character-driven storytelling. The fights are not just physical confrontations but are often tied to the characters' personal growth and the broader plot. This integration of action and story is one of the show's strengths, keeping the audience invested in both the outcome of the battles and the fate of the characters.

In conclusion, ""Wind Breaker"" is an anime that I highly recommend. It combines breathtaking fight choreography, stunning graphics, and well-rounded characters to create a compelling viewing experience. The series has already shown significant character development and plot progression in just eight episodes, promising even more exciting developments in the future. Whether you are a fan of action-packed anime or enjoy character-driven stories, ""Wind Breaker"" has something to offer.

The journey of watching ""Wind Breaker"" has been a thrilling one so far, and I am eager to see where the story goes next. With its impressive start and consistent quality, it has quickly become one of my favorite anime. If you haven't started watching it yet, I urge you to give it a try.

I hate to generalize but when you upset two of today's most toxic groups, that believe they know something you don't, then you will certainly have my attention.

Lindelof's approach is not canon and it's fine. Watchmen's current and official sequel in the comic books ended last Wednesday with the release of Doomsday Clock #12 where the long-awaited confrontation between Dr. Manhattan and Superman will finally occur.

But personally I think it was a great show. He took the world from the comic book and gave it a different voice.
He built an interesting mystery around certain characters from the original story and rooted it in fairly relevant themes that as it showed from its first episode and until its last, encompass decades of hatred that are still alive today.

Until now it's believed that it will only be a stand-alone season and if so I'm okay with it.
I'm open to a second one, but I think the story that was told was enough. And believe me that I enjoyed it week by week since it started.

My only but and that's why I didn't give it the 5 stars is that despite the good handling of the plot, Lindelof made a mistake in order to make his romantic story work and that is that he weakened Dr. Manhattan. A lot.

I understand it's his vision, but you're telling me that Ozymandias being the smartest person in the world didn't manage to capture that omnipotent being but a flock of racists did? C'mon.

**Original Review (based on the season's first six episodes handed to press):**

When I discovered that a new show based on the world of Watchmen was in the works, I really didn't have any sort of reaction. But then it was announced that Damon Lindelof (responsible for co-creating my favorite TV series ever, Lost) was the mind behind all of it and that the show wouldn't follow either the graphic novel or Zack Snyder's film, I was genuinely excited. I really enjoy 2009's Watchmen, but I always felt that a single movie (even with an extended runtime) was not enough to showcase its complex rules and layered themes. With this series, Lindelof delivers one of the best new TV shows of the year!

Within the first six episodes, it's already remarkable what he's able to achieve. I've seen some people complaining about how political the season is... You do know we're discussing Watchmen, right? Both the comic and film are packed with politics and social messages relevant to this day and age. So, obviously, the TV series is also heavily centered around a political tone, and it's handled beautifully. Nowadays, it's challenging to produce anything that addresses sensitive issues because, well, people get offended pretty easily. Having in mind the opening sequence of the pilot (so brutal), it's undeniable that the show is incredibly brave in tackling historical moments in a fictional work.

While Snyder's style is occasionally present, the graphic novel has a tremendous impact on the series regarding its references and story. By now, the first episode has already aired, so you already have at least one hint of where the show might be placed in time and space. What I love the most about this season is undoubtedly its storytelling structure. Lindelof borrows his own tricks from Lost and uses the back-and-forward way of telling how the action is happening. This non-linear chronology of events generates tons of questions that are answered in innovative, intelligent, and twisty plot points.

I would say that the first two chapters ask more than explain, but from the third episode onwards, all have significant revelations (and a few more questions). Some are completely unexpected and shocking. Others may be predictable but are told through a unique perspective. Every time I finished an episode, I wanted the ""Next Episode"" button to click on (fortunately for me, I did have that button). This desire not only has to do with the captivating screenplay, but with the fully-developed, compelling characters. In the same way that the movie wasn't a generic superhero flick, this series deals with more profound thematics.

Regina King is a total badass as Sister Night, but it's Angela Abar who makes the viewer care about her. From her life principles to her strong personality, she has everything a protagonist needs. King shines in a few emotionally powerful scenes, but her action sequences are also impressive. Yes, let me get this out of the way: there's more than enough fights. If I'm not mistaken, every single episode has at least a couple of great action scenes. A few long takes, some excellent choreography, but just like the source material, Watchmen isn't about the (cool) fights.

Every character is really well-developed. From their backstory to their desires, everyone gets a good chunk of runtime, including the seemingly secondary characters. No one is ""just there"". Everyone has a role to play either in the intriguing plot or in the eventually important mysterious side stories. Jeremy Irons is phenomenal as Adrian Veidt, and I recommend patience and tons of attention to his story that seems isolated. It's probably the most puzzling subplot of the show. Jean Smart shares the lead torch with King from the third episode on, by portraying someone we all know and love. Once again, the casting is perfect, as well as her outstanding performance.

Tim Blake Nelson does a great job with the most fascinating secondary character, Looking Glass. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II doesn't have much to do as Angela's husband, Cal Abar, but he still offers a grounded display. Finally, Louis Gossett Jr gives the fitting mysterious vibe to ""the wheelchair guy"". Damon Lindelof doesn't hold back when it comes to reference other works. Easter Eggs to both the film and comic are spread across the entire season. He always hides a few critical elements to the plot in the background or even in plain sight (someone's secretary or office), so be sure to keep your eyes wide open.

Technically, I have to praise the costume design, which offers some awesome superhero outfits. I love how CGI-less the series is as well. There are tons of practical effects, the production design is astonishing, and the use of real sets delivers that realism that a green screen can never get quite right. The score is addictive and even helpful to understand where the story might be going (if you've seen the first episode, you should research where the title card came from).

Watchmen is one of the best TV shows to premiere this year. Its pilot resembles Lost's, where dozens of questions are asked, and barely any answer is given. So far, I only have one minor issue with one of the subplots that doesn't seem to be developing at the same pace or with the same concern as the rest. Everything else is pretty much seamless. From the phenomenal casting to the exceptionally well-developed, compelling characters, Damon Lindelof is able to deliver yet another fantastic TV series. The technical quality is impeccable as expected, but it's the original take on a post-Watchmen (comic/movie) through an incredibly captivating storytelling structure that impresses me the most. If you're a fan of Snyder's film or the comic, definitely don't miss this show! If you have no past experience with this world, then this series won't stop to explain to you what happened or how things got where they're at.

**Final Thoughts (based on the remaining episodes and the entire season):**

I never thought I would be re-reading my original review, and laugh so much at myself for thinking certain characters or particular subplots wouldn't have that much interest or impact in the narrative. My only issue concerning the first six episodes revolved around a subplot involving Lady Trieu (Hong Chau), which I found to be slowly developing, and it was the only story I wasn't able to fit with the others. So, my overall opinion on the season would heavily depend on how the last three episodes tie everything together...

Damon Lindelof is a genius. You know when something is so incredible that we start getting a bit angry because of how flawless it is? That's me on the penultimate chapter, A God Walks into Abar. It's one of the best episodes based on exposition in the history of television! Looking back, I can now affirm that every single shot matters. Every line of dialogue, every tiny little detail. If Game of Thrones ditched tons of narratives and prophecies in its last season, Watchmen does the exact opposite: it literally ties every thread, big or small, together in a seamless fashion.

If you are part of the group of people who gave up on the first episodes due to their ambiguousness, then you missed the answers to the questions that made you quit. You missed one of the best-written seasons ever. Patience is a virtue, and everyone should go back and watch the whole show before jumping to impulsive decisions. I promise: every single story makes sense, and all are blended together in the most perfect, mind-blowing, entertaining way possible. From the wheelchair old man to the whereabouts of Dr. Manhattan or Adrian Veidt, you won't be disappointed. The ending will generate discourse for years or at least until an inevitable (?) second season.

If, after six episodes, I couldn't wholly assert that Damon Lindelof delivered one of the best TV shows of the year, now I can. Watchmen is not only the best TV series of 2019, but it's one of the best debut seasons I've ever witnessed. From its jaw-dropping writing to the outstanding performances, it possesses more than just a couple of near-perfect episodes. It might scare some people off due to its initial vagueness, but the last episodes compensate the time spent thinking about the numerous questions. If you're a fan of the graphic novel or of Zack Snyder's film, you need to experience this TV adaptation. Just make sure you have previous knowledge of this world because Lindelof doesn't stop to introduce anyone to how things work...

>_The first thing I saw in the moonlight was the placard with its legend in large, block letters: ""I defiled my race."" Above the placard leered the horribly bloated, purplish face of a young woman, her eyes wide open and bulging, her mouth agape. Finally I could make out the thin, vertical line of rope disappearing into the branches above. Apparently the rope had slipped a bit or the branch to which it was tied had sagged, until the woman's feet were resting on the pavement, giving the_ _uncanny appearance of a corpse standing upright of its own volition._

>_I shuddered and quickly went on my way. There are many thousands of hanging female corpses like that in this city tonight, all wearing identical placards around their necks. They are the White women who were married to or living with Blacks, with Jews, or with other non-White males. There are also a number of men wearing the l-defiled-my-race placard, but the women easily outnumber them seven or eight to one._

Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces. It is not God who kills the children. Not fate that butchers them or destiny that feeds them to the dogs. It's us. Only us._

No, the Klan were not strictly legal, but they did work voluntarily to preserve American culture in areas where there were very real dangers of that culture being overrun and mongrelized._

Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, _Watchmen_ was published by DC Comics in 12 issues in 1986 and 1987. Knowing absolutely nothing of comics, I was completely unaware of its existence until 2005, when it placed on _TIME_'s ""100 Best English-Language Novels (1923-2005)"". The mere fact that it appeared on such a list, alongside such titans as William Faulkner's _The Sound and the Fury_ (1929), Thomas Pynchon's _Gravity's Rainbow_ (1973), and Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ (1987), was enough to pique my curiosity and so I read it, and I liked it a great deal. Its deconstruction of the superhero genre is brilliantly handled, dismantling and interrogating virtually every generic trope so as to question the very purpose of such stories even as it exists as an example of one. At the same time, its depiction of Cold War paranoia and condemnation of right-wing idolatry are front and centre without ever seeming forced. Moore himself considers the comic ""unfilmable"", and several prominent directors had tried and failed (Terry Gilliam in 1991, Darren Aronofsky in 2004, and Paul Greengrass in 2006). However, in 2009, it finally reached the screen, directed by Zack Snyder...and the less we say about that, the better. The film recounts the plot well, but it has none of the thematic nuance or subtle genre-interrogation. All of which brings us to HBO's new limited series. Created by showrunner Damon Lindelof (co-creator of the TV game-changer that was _Lost_ and the seminal existential masterwork that was _The Leftovers_), this was actually HBO's third attempt to create a _Watchman_ series under Lindelof's guidance, but he turned down both of their previous offers (in 2010 and 2013). The most significant thing about this particular adaptation, however, is that it isn't an adaptation; it's an original story which serves as a pseudo-sequel, taking place 33 years after the events of the comic, and featuring some (but not all) of the surviving characters, mixed with plenty of new blood. As expected, Moore refused to participate in the production in any way, but Gibbons was very much on-board throughout.

But is the show any good? Well, it's not as good as _The Leftovers_ (what is?), but it is an exceptional piece of work, and literally gets better with each episode, culminating in a one-two combo of uncharacteristic emotional power, with the last two episodes being as good a couple of hours of TV as you're ever likely to see. The acting is immense, the writing is incisive and challenging, the aesthetic is stunning, and the show was a worthy winner of no less than 11 Emmys from its 26 nominations, including ""Outstanding Limited Series"", ""Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie"" (Regina King), ""Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie "" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), ""Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Damon Lindelof and Cord Jefferson for ""This Extraordinary Being""), ""Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Gregory Middleton for ""This Extraordinary Being""), and ""Outstanding Musical Composition for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for ""It's Summer and We're Running Out of Ice""). All in all, _Watchmen_ is that rarest of beasts – a show which lives up to the hype.

Familiarity with the plot of the original isn't a requirement so as to appreciate the sequel, as you're given all the world-building back-info you need, but it can certainly help you get the most out of Lindelof's intricate narrative and thematic tapestry, especially in the earlier episodes. The world of Watchmen is a slightly different version of our world, with the major point of departure coming with the publication of Issue #1 of _Action Comics_ in June 1938, which introduced Superman to the world, and brought the still-in-its-infancy superhero genre into the mainstream cultural lexicon. In the world of the comic, unlike in the real world, this leads to the rise of ""costumed adventurers""; ordinary people without any special powers who take to the streets to fight crime and corruption. The only person with genuine superpowers emerges in 1959 – nuclear physicist Dr. John Osterman is apparently killed in an Intrinsic Field Subtractor accident, only to return as Doctor Manhattan, a god-like being with immense quantum powers including clairvoyance, chronokinesis, dimensional travel, precognition, self-regeneration, subatomic manipulation, telekinesis, and teleportation. He also experiences time non-linearly, with every moment of his existence (past and future) happening at once. Due primarily to the involvement of Manhattan, the US win the Vietnam War, gaining a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, and leading to an escalation of nuclear tensions. Over the years, however, the public come to lose faith in adventurers and in 1977, the Keene Act outlaws all costumed adventurers except those sanctioned by the government, of which there were very few.

As the comic begins, it is 1985, and Richard Nixon is in his fifth term as president, having abolished the 22nd Amendment in the wake of victory in Vietnam (Edward Blake, a government-sanctioned adventurer known as The Comedian, ensured all evidence of Watergate was destroyed before it was made public and also carried out the Nixon-ordered assassination of JFK). When Manhattan is inaccurately accused of causing cancer, he exiles himself to Mars and washes his hands of humanity. As the US depend upon him as a nuclear deterrent, his departure throws the geopolitical sphere into chaos. However, as Walter Kovacs (an adventurer named Rorschach) begins an investigation into a possible conspiracy to kill former adventurers, Laurie Juspeczyk (Silk Spectre) is able to convince Manhattan to return to Earth. Meanwhile, Rorschach uncovers evidence which suggests the ""smartest man in the world"", Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias), may be behind the conspiracy. He confronts Veidt, who explains his plan to save humanity from nuclear war by faking an alien invasion, which he hopes will unite the superpowers against a perceived common enemy. Rorschach vows to stop him, but Veidt reveals that he has already enacted his plan – a giant squid supposedly from another dimension (but really just a genetically engineered earth squid), has emerged in New York unleashing a ""psychic shockwave"" which has wiped out half the city's inhabitants (around three million people). Rorschach insists he will reveal the truth, but is confronted by Manhattan who argues that such a truth can only hurt humanity. Rorschach, however, refuses to listen, and Manhattan is forced to kill him to keep Veidt's actions secret. The comic ends with a copy of Rorschach's journal, which explains Veidt's plan in detail, reaching the far-right publication _New Frontiersman_, with the journal placed in the ""crank file"" for possible future publication.

And so we arrive at the TV show. 

Tulsa, OK, 2018; the preceding 33 years have seen a series of dramatic change in the world of _Watchmen_. Veidt's plan worked perfectly, and the US and Soviets formed an alliance to guard against the possibility of another 'invasion'. Rorschach's journal was published by the _New Frontiersman_, but has been dismissed as a hoax ever since, with only the far-right and conspiracy theorists believing it authentic. Meanwhile, white supremacist groups have been on the rise, and after an incident in Tulsa where almost the entire police department was wiped out in a coordinated attack by a KKK off-shoot known as the Seventh Kavalry, a law is passed that allows police to wear masks and remain anonymous. There are even certain police officers who wear costumes and operate under an alias, not unlike the still-outlawed costumed adventurers of the previous century. Another important part of the make-up of law enforcement is that police officers' guns are secured in their car, and can only be released remotely, and only if the officer can justify to HQ the potential use of deadly force. Meanwhile, with Nixon now dead, a Democratic president sits in the Oval Office – former actor Robert Redford, who is currently in his seventh, and final, term, and has introduced a massive system of reparations for African-Americans whose ancestors experienced racial injustice (contemptuously called ""Redfordations"" by the right). Finally, Doctor Manhattan has returned to Mars and no longer communicates with Earth.

In essence, the story follows the fallout from a murder, which is soon discovered to be much more complex than originally thought, and could have far-reaching implications not only for Tulsa, but the entire planet. Within this _milieu_, we follow multiple characters, some new, some old. The protagonist is Angela Abar (a predictably stunning (Regina King); officially retired from Tulsa PD, Angela continues to work as the masked cop known as Sister Night. Other characters include Laurie Blake (a wonderfully acerbic Jean Smart), aka Silk Spectre, who is now an FBI agent tasked with rounding up costumed adventurers whenever they emerge; Judd Crawford (a still effortlessly-cool Don Johnson), chief of Tulsa PD; Wade Tillman (Tim Blake Nelson), a cop who works under the moniker of Looking Glass and specialises in interrogations; Will Reeves (Louis Gossett Jr. reminding us all how good he is), an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, but who seems to know a lot about a great many things; Senator Joe Keene Jr. (James Wolk), son of the senator who wrote the Keene Act, and the man mainly responsible for allowing Tulsa PD to wear masks; Lady Trieu (a brilliantly emotionless Hong Chau), the world's first ever trillionaire; Cal Abar (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), Angela's husband; Red Scare (Andrew Howard), a proudly communist member of the Tulsa PD, originally from Russia; Jane Crawford (Frances Fisher), Judd's wife; Pirate Jenny (Jessica Camacho), another costumed Tulsa police officer; Bian (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), Trieu's daughter; and Agent Dale Petey (Dustin Ingram), an expert on the history of costumed adventures who accompanies Laurie to Tulsa to investigate the murder. At the same time, we are also introduced to an unidentified man (played by Jeremy Irons, who is clearly having the time of his life) living in luxury on the grounds of a remote castle at an unknown location. So too do we meet his butler, Mr Phillips (Tom Mison) and his maid, Miss. Crookshanks (Sara Vickers). How all of this relates to what is happening in Tulsa is perhaps the show's biggest ongoing mystery (and don't expect early answers).

As with the original comic, the TV show is thematically rich. Lindelof has stated that he wanted to tackle whatever socio-political issue that was to 2019 as the Cold War was to 1985, and to him, it ""_felt like it was undeniably race and policing_"" (the fact that the show has proved so extraordinarily prophetic is essentially irrelevant to its quality, but it is amazing that here we have a show depicting African-Americans refusing to bow down to oppression that was made before the death of George Floyd, a show depicting the widespread but controversial wearing of masks that was made long before the COVID-19 pandemic was a thing). Politically then, the show does much the same thing as the comic did – it deploys a real-world socio-political problem in a not quite 1:1 fictional _milieu_. In Ronald Reagan's America, the focus was on apocalyptic Cold War paranoia, whereas in Trump's Divided States, the most pressing existential threat is the rise of right-wing extremism, with those who once remained in the shadows having been emboldened by a racist president to confidently espouse their hatred for all to see. At the same time, on the show's official podcast, Lindelof explains,

>_For_ Watchmen _to be culturally relevant in 2019, it has to be some sort of funhouse mirror reflection of the time that we're living in. There's a really fascinating conversation that erupted around the show as we were airing the first three or four episodes, which was the idea that ""this show is too political"", and also, parallel to that, how can the show call itself Watchmen. Well, the show is political, but my own personal politics, and I make no bones about the fact that I'm a liberal and very progressively minded, but at the same time, the original_ Watchmen _is kind of anarchist in its blood and it has to troll the extremes, so you have to troll extreme liberalism, extreme progressivism. I happen to think that reparations are a really good idea, whether they're reparations for slavery or reparations for something like the Tulsa Massacre. I also have to accept that were reparations actually enacted, there would be a virulent pushback from a large sector of our society. Do I take sides? Well, my side is that I think we have a big white supremacy problem in the United States of America. I'm not here saying, there's good people on both sides. That being said, I'm just presenting what I think would actually happen were reparations to be passed._

This is a key point; in a country as ideologically divided as the post-2016 United States, achieving any kind of political or cultural harmony is next to impossible, and how the show presents the reactions of right-wing characters to Redfordations reminds us of how attempts at reconciliation can often serve to force people even farther apart.

The theme of white and black and racial tension comes up time and again throughout the series. For example, the Abars have two children, although both Angela and Cal are black and the children are white – a black couple adopting white children is very rare on TV or in cinema, where the prevailing narrative trope remains that of the ""white saviour"". Another good example is that in episode seven, ""An Almost Religious Awe"", a member of Seventh Kavalry asserts that ""_white men in masks are heroes. Black men in masks are scary_"", whilst in episode nine, ""See How They Fly"", another member of the group proclaims, ""_it is extremely difficult to be a white man in America right now_"" (a hilarious, if it wasn't so dangerous, sentiment taken very much from the real world, where racists will often argue that there's no such thing as White Privilege, and those who are really oppressed are white, Christian, heterosexual males). In the same episode, speaking of President Redford and his ""libstapo"", it is stated, ""_first he took our guns. And then, he made us say sorry. Over and over again. Sorry. Sorry for the alleged sins of those who died decades before we were born. Sorry for the colour of our skin_"" (and this, obviously, ties back into the notion that Redford's attempts to heal division has led only to enhancing it).

Of course, within this, another major theme is law enforcement, with Lindelof posing the fascinating question of what happens when you mix masks with the administration of the law. The show is obsessed with law and order, and specifically how racial tensions are manifested within such a system, from literally its opening frames. As the first episode begins, we are watching _Trust in the Law_, a 1921 Oscar Micheaux film about Deputy Bass Reeves, aka The Black Marshal, the first African-American federal marshal west of the Mississippi (Bass Reeves was a real marshal and Micheaux was a real director, although _Trust in the Law_ is not a real film). The scene opens with a man in black chasing a man in white across a prairie. Reaching a church, the man in black dismounts the man in white just as the congregation emerge. The man in white is then revealed to be a local sheriff and the man in black is an African-American. The congregation immediately assume that the victim here is the white bedecked sheriff, but it quickly emerges that the sheriff is corrupt and the man in black is a marshal performing an arrest. When the congregation decide to string up the sheriff, Reeves prevents them, stating, ""_No mob justice today – trust in the law_"" (which, of course, is doubly ironic insofar as not trusting in the law is the very basis for costumed adventurers in the first place – inversion on top of inversion). After a brutal and harrowing depiction of the Tulsa Race Massacre (when white supremacists launched an attack on the predominantly black-owned Greenwood District, killing up to 300 people, injuring over 800, and torching the businesses in the area), the first scene set in 2018 depicts a masked and menacing cop pulling over a truck and exchanging a few words with the nervous driver. However, again, the colours are inverted – the cop is black and the driver is white. These two scenes form a beautiful bit of visual story-telling, establishing immediately the centrality of racial tensions, conveying that such things are often more complex than they appear (there is no fixed black and white), and that the show plans to upend and invert common tropes. 

A third major theme is trauma. The core purpose of Redfordations is to address and acknowledge generational trauma, but many of the characters are wrestling with much more private and personal traumas, which, to one extent or another, have come to define who they are. Angela and Judd, for example, carry with them the trauma of surviving the Seventh Kavalry's massacre of Tulsa PD; Cal carries with him the trauma of an unspecified accident several years earlier that left him with partial amnesia; Looking Glass carries the trauma of being in New York when the squid attacked, and has become paranoid about the possibility of something similar happening again; Laurie carries the trauma of her family history (her father was the masked adventurer The Comedian, who raped her mother, Sally Jupiter, aka. the first Silk Spectre, although Laurie was the product of a later, consensual, relationship between the two) and a failed past romance with Manhattan which colours everything in her present; Will carries the trauma of witnessing the Tulsa Race Massacre. 

As thematically rich as the show is, however, one cannot help also admiring its aesthetic, with the structure of each episode serving as a subtle nod to the structure of the comic. Instead of panels of various sizes, the comic was primarily structured by way of a grid of nine panels of the same size on each page. The middle two pages differed, featuring three panels on the outside edge of each page, and half of a larger picture per page, thus the two pages acted as structural mirrors to one another. This symmetricality is replicated in the show insofar as each episode features opening and closing scenes which mirror one another. So, for example, one episode begins with leaflets falling from the sky, and ends with a car rising into the sky; another begins with a couple patiently awaiting something that may not happen, and ends with two different people awaiting something that definitely will happen; another opens with a busload of people bringing a message of life, and ends with a van of people bringing death.

It's also worth noting how the show-within-the-show is presented. Within the _Watchmen milieu_, _America Hero Story_, an affectionate reference to Ryan Murphy, is a hugely popular TV show about the Minutemen, a group of costumed adventurers formed in 1939 by Nelson Gardner (Captain Metropolis), Silk Spectre, and Spectre's agent Laurence Schexnayder. We see several extracts from the show, but none are more eye-catching than the scene in episode three, which depicts the first time Hooded Justice (the first costumed adventurer) foiled a crime. This scene is staged as an elaborate over-the-top action sequence with a quite ridiculous amount of unjustified and unnecessary slow-motion (mixed in with fast transitions and regular speed footage). Sound familiar? If you've seen any of Snyder's films, you'll recognise the style – and if you've seen his adaptation of _Watchmen_, you'll immediately see why _American Hero Story_ was shot this way. For me, the main reason the 2009 film failed was that style was far more important than theme, often to the point of undermining that theme. These characters are not supposed to be noble and badass action heroes whom we admire for their toughness and bravery. Quite the contrary. Yet in Snyder's film, characters who are supposed to represent the utter unworkability of heroes in the real world and illustrate how human foibles will always destroy idealism are shown having elaborately choreographed slow-motion brawls set to a thumping score and frenetically edited. The style is literally contradicting the theme – it's amateur hour 101 and smacks of someone who responds to the coolness of the comic's visual design, but understands none of the underlying context. Thankfully, Lindelof most definitely does understand that context, and it's that understanding which makes the _American Hero Story_ scenes so funny.

The aesthetic is also impressive on its own terms, particularly the cinematography and editing, and I'd be remiss here not to mention episodes six and eight. Directed by executive producer Stephen Williams, ""This Extraordinary Being"" is shot primarily in black and white, and takes place in the 30s and 40s, with the cinematography by Gregory Middleton, nothing short of exemplary. Employing the odd bit of colour here and there within the black and white photography to focus our attention on particular objects, there is also an extraordinary 4-minute single shot which goes in and out of several buildings, features a plethora of extras, some VFX, and a lot of SFX. Stunning stuff. As for ""A God Walks Into Abar"" (as good an episode of TV as you could ever imagine), all I can say is this: if you're interested in learning about editing, watch this episode. Directed by head director and executive producer Nicole Kassell and cut by Henk Van Eeghan, the episode essentially tries to give a visual representation of how Doctor Manhattan experiences time – with every moment in his experience all happening at once, so he can 'remember' things that haven't happened yet, or be 'within' multiple memories from the past all at the same time. It's a spellbinding exercise in stylistic control. The editing (and writing) are so tight, and the time jumps so absolutely flawless, folding organically into one another to form a single cohesive template, it's some of the finest editing I've ever seen.

_Watchmen_ is an exceptionally good show. By default, of course, there will be fans of the comic who'll dislike it on principle. There will also be those who accuse it of pandering to a liberal PC agenda (look at the negative (and frankly, hilarious) review bombing on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes), and there'll be those who simply don't like the idea of a _Watchman_ TV show with a black woman at its centre. Make no mistake, however, this show has been put together by people who know, appreciate, love, and understand the comic. Thematically complex, aesthetically breathtaking, brilliantly acted, _Watchmen_ is an exceptional piece of television.","Regina King, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Irons, Jean Smart, Tom Mison","* * _exceptional every way ; thematically rich , aesthetically breathtaking , emotionally devastating_ * * > _the first thing saw moonlight placard legend large , block letter : `` defile race .

Back to the show, so even though it wasn't on my list of TV projects to make if I ran Hollywood, I am so happy they did.  Even though the story might not always seem fresh, it is apparently a story I love and NEVER get tired of.  It seems we should always have sexy aliens from outer space on TV.  It is also surprisingly easy to care about alien orphans who are just trying to survive on their new home world.  I have no issues with the cast.  They are an interesting collection of guest stars and supporting actors who are getting their chance at stardom.  At the heart of the story, there is also romance, another aspect that is always popular with TV viewers.  In this case, the lovers are separated by their shared history, misunderstandings, hostile family members, and other external forces.  Will their love survive?   Will they get together?

8056,Power Rangers,"Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Kids",7.1,"Rating and reviewing Power Rangers as a whole is such a bizarre prospect. Casts and plotlines change nearly every year, property ownership has been inconsistent, and there are even a few different timelines at this point. Quality between seasons thus varies wildly and even beyond that, it exist as an ""adaptation"" of the popular Japanese series Super Sentai. Do we examine the quality of each season in a vacuum? If so, Time Force is one of the strongest seasons, but then again, it's so similar to the slightly superior Timeranger that maybe something like Lost Galaxy is more valuable.

Do we judge quality overall, even when seasons can be easily ignored? If so, Power Rangers is pretty bad. But then again, so is The Simpsons. The Neo-Saban era was a disaster: Samurai, Megaforce, and Ninja Steel are among the worst television seasons to ever hit a screen, and Dino Charge could be generously called ""ok."" But RPM is amazing and it can be enjoyed independent from all other seasons. In Space rules so much it retroactively adds value to hundreds of subpar episodes that came before it. Dino Thunder is a legacy season done well. There are high highs and low lows and some of them require each other and some don't. Power Rangers is a _weird_ series.

We're currently in the Hasbro era now. And it's alright. Beast Morphers was far from perfect but it was also proof that the new owners had at least a basic respect for the property. Dino Fury was mostly fine too. Neither hit the heights of the post-Zardon and Disney eras. But they were cute.

There are too many issues with this series to call it ""good."" Yet there are too many things I love about it for me to call it outright bad. So I'm giving it a 6/10. Below, I've scored each series. With the exception of MMPR through In Space, you can jump in anywhere and basically ignore anything. Callbacks exist but aren't huge.

It's that kind of a show.

The main plotline is interesting but with each episode you realize you're not supposed to be watching this for the story as it deviates and goes on tangents for the entire show, showing you the lives of secondary characters that you don't care about.

Here is everything that is wrong:

1. This show contains very strong subjects such as pedophilia, sexual exploitation of minors and rape. All of these themes are not taken seriously and you can feel the author included them just to be edgy.
2. The characters are messed up, the main character is in love with his underage cousin, the other girls are bland and uninspired stereotypes which whole purpose is to show how attractive the main character is.
3. The show forgets the main plotline of assassinating the hero.
4. With each episode it gets progressively worse.

Here is everything that I liked:

1. The dad of the protagonist is a great character.
2. It has good music.
3. It looks decent the first 4 episodes, then it gets bad.

8075,The K2,"Action & Adventure, Drama, Crime",7.5,"**_Definitely a must watch show_**

**I. Story**
When you thought you have guessed the twists and turns, a new layer is introduced to prove your guesses wrong. This is rare in this genre and the writer, Hyuk Rin Jang, wrote a masterpiece.

While ""The K2"" was mainly about the political game, it was also about family relationships and the politics that is common in large clans with huge money at stake. This type of story is usually told by showing a dragging drama but in this TV series they approached it from an ""outsider"" view or as a secondary story. THe family politics was there but they were careful in keeping it from becoming the main story.

**II. Acting**
Excellent acting from the veteran and younger actors. The fight scenes, especially in episode one was beyond Western choreography, ""James Bond"" and ""Mission: Impossible"" can never match what they did.

I was also impressed by YoonA's acting of her character. At first it looked like her role was easy but as we get into the middle episodes, her character was challenging--she had to be a totally different person, someone with PTSD and deep hatred.

**III. Music**
The background music were perfect. It adds to the impact of an already powerful scene. It was good because BGMs should act as an amplifier for scenes and not as ""the scene"".

**IV. Production**
Great production. Clearly every centavo was spent to create a realistic show which captivated the audience and made the boundary between reality and fiction non-existent.","Ji Chang-wook, Song Yun-ah, Yoona, Cho Seong-ha, Kim Kap-soo","* * _definitely must watch show_ * * * * i. story * * think guess twist turn , new layer introduce prove guess wrong . rare genre writer , hyuk rin jang , write masterpiece . `` k2 '' mainly political game , also family relationships politics common large clans huge money stake . type story usually tell show drag drama tv series approach `` outsider '' view secondary story . family politics careful keep become main story . * * ii . act * * excellent act veteran younger actors . fight scenes , especially episode one beyond western choreography , `` jam bond '' `` mission : impossible '' never match . also impress yoona 's act character . first look like role easy get middle episodes , character challenge -- totally different person , someone ptsd deep hatred . * * iii . music * * background music perfect . add impact already powerful scene . good bgms act amplifier scenes `` scene '' . * * iv . production * * great production . clearly every centavo spend create realistic show captivate audience make boundary reality fiction non-existent .",1,1

Repeating the exact same dramatic flashbacks multiple times throughout both seasons further highlights my point. It ended up relying on these melo moments rather than having a better written political drama and a more engaging dialogues as you would expect from a good political drama to have. What also didn't fit its theme is the male lead constant overreacting and overacting for his role. The romance of the main leads and the pair up of the secondary leads were all out of place. On the other hand, the OST was nice, it reminded me of Comrades (2010).

8130,Aladdin,"Action & Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Kids",6.899,"""Aladdin and the King of Thieves"" serves as the third installment in the Aladdin franchise, predating the live-action adaptation. Despite my deep affection for Aladdin and Jasmine, this animated film falls short and undermines the franchise's outstanding qualities.

While the storyline introduces Aladdin's father, adding an interesting layer to the narrative, the animation quality leaves much to be desired. The visuals come across as subpar, reminiscent of content from the Disney Channel rather than a theatrical release. Despite this, the return of Robin Williams as the genie is a bright spot in the film.

Despite its flaws, I appreciate this chapter in Aladdin's story and the continuation of the characters' journeys. The inclusion of Aladdin's father and the development of other villains enrich the overall narrative. While I cherish the Aladdin story and its expansion, from a cinematic perspective, this particular installment falls short.

Shifting focus to the Aladdin television series, I find it remarkable that viewers were able to further explore the characters beyond the original films. The series provided an opportunity to delve into various storylines and adventures, offering a more in-depth look at the beloved characters.

As a fan of the animated series, which also stemmed from a video game, I have a deep appreciation for the entire Aladdin franchise. The series, in particular, holds a special place in my heart as it allowed for continued engagement with these beloved characters and storylines.

8156,The Blood Of Youth,"Action & Adventure, Drama",7.9,"**The best Chinese TV Series I have watched in 2022 - 2023 (so far).**

Before this TV series came out, I already saw it and even after it came out, I didn't think to watch it because I thought the poster was a bit dull and simple. (I always judge the poster before watching a movie and then I decide whether to watch it or not based on the poster it has.) And I also thought that the story is too simple. To be honest, I have already passed. Then I saw in a post on Facebook that this TV series became popular in China and got a lot of positive ratings and the rating of over 7 on Douban (IMDb of China). So, I decided to take a look. And I'm glad that I watched.

This TV series is superb, you know. This was the first time I saw Li Hongyi. I have never seen any of his films before and even I didn't know who he is until I saw this one. But while I was watching this and after, I became his fan. He's a new actor but he could do amazing job and performed the exactly how Xiao Se character is. His acting skill is great. And also the other actors are.

One of the facts that made this TV series great is the casting. Almost all of actors (except for one) are perfectly fit in their characters. They could perform their characters very well. It's like they were born to play their characters they were acting. Because of this, it became great.

Another fact I like to mention is the usage of doubles and stunts in movies. In some Chinese TV series, I have seen very clearly that they have used doubles and stunts. Of course every movie that has action scenes, they always use doubles and stunts. But you need to do it not to be seen as doubles and stunts were doing those actions. It should be seen like the actual actors are doing those scenes. This is the art of using doubles and stunts. If this seems too obvious, then I feel like the whole thing is destroyed. I have already seen those kinds of TV series where doubles and stunts are doing actions very clearly. But in this TV series, it's not obvious. I almost thought that the actual actors were doing those actions. This is one of the facts that I like this one a lot.

About the story, yes, the story is simple. It's about fighting to get that god-damned throne which some of us have seen a lot in Chinese TV series. I also have seen a lot of those stories. Enough to feel bored. But this one is quite different. A simple story, but it didn't make me bored. The director somehow managed to make it not to seem bored. There are some funny scenes but it didn't destroy the whole thing. In fact, those scenes made the audience relaxed during this kind of difficult time. This is another reason why this TV series is great.

Here comes the special effects. Most of the special effects used in Chinese TV series somehow had flaws. Some were not smooth. Some made us think this was made later in editing stage. But special effects used in this TV series seemed to be real. I almost thought that this has happened in real life, not in the movie. I must admit that China's CG skill has improved a lot. I hope they could continue like this in the future.

Soundtracks and original scores are one of the things that made a movie great or completely destroyed. The original scores used in this TV series are also great too. And also soundtracks. A lot of soundtracks are used from animation's. But this is also good. The songs are perfectly fit in the scenes they were put in. And also those songs are very good to listen. I love them very much.

The only thing I don't like is the fact that this TV series has only 40 episodes. Forty episodes is kind of short. I want it to have 50 episodes because after I watched it, I felt like it's too early that it's finished. I wanted to watch more because of the fact that I became Li Hongyi's fan and also the fact that it is very good to watch.

If I have to recommend a friend what to watch, I would highly recommend this TV series because of it's high quality that made a movie great. 10/10.

8233,Primeval,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Action & Adventure, Drama",7.453,"This review is about series 1. I expect someday I will return and do an update after I rewatch the subsequent four seasons.

I was not one of those kids who grew up liking all things dinosaur. I guess I was more into DC comic book heroes. But I began to appreciate dinosaurs when the Jurassic Park series of movies came along, where the stories were excellent and the dinosaurs looked and acted more real.

I have also always enjoyed time travel stories, and in a way, this show combines those two sci-fi sub-genres. It seemed like a good fit for me, and indeed, I enjoyed series one overall. There are plenty of tense moments, realistic creatures, and bits of wit and humor sprinkled throughout. I especially appreciated Ben Miller’s portrayal of the sarcastic head of the secretive government department that dealt with the incursions. It would have been easy to have an authoritarian, square-headed bully in the role.

The storylines were intriguing and the ensemble cast had great chemistry for the most part. If they ever do a reboot, however, there are a few changes I would suggest. I think Connor really needed a girlfriend outside of the team. His panting after Abby got old and repetitive real quick. And do we really need the Helen Cutter character throwing monkey wrenches into the plots by magically appearing and disappearing like a goddess in a Greek tragedy? She never makes a clear case to explain her position on what they should do about the anomalies. Plus she seems about as unlikeable as a gal could be expected to be after going without sex for several years. I think cutting her from the show could be the making of Nick Cutter as a man.

Series one ends with a massive cliffhanger and revelation, so I assume someone had green lighted the second series by the time they filmed the final episode.

So I enjoyed series one and will rewatch the next series and report back here.

Very similar to Goddess of Fire with its storytelling, transformation, progress and conclusion. The drama didn't deserve to be longer than 16 episodes at best for the amount of material it had to offer. Quickly enough, they deviated from fashion design in favor of typical bland drama antics.

8391,Three Brothers,Drama,4.5,"This family drama revolves around three brothers, each with their own distinct characteristics and struggles. The eldest brother faces challenges in life and always reach a dead end, the middle brother is obsessed with money, and the youngest brother relentlessly pursues the love of a girl throughout the drama's 70 episodes. Unfortunately, the relationships portrayed in the drama were plagued by extreme seething toxicity, which undermines their overall appeal. The drama lacked a clear overarching goal and instead focuses on a series of smaller, successive problems. Which resulted in underdeveloped storylines for most of the couples in the drama. Out of the three main couples, the youngest one had the most nonsensical relationship. While the banter between him and Eo Young may have moments of endearment, it can also be seriously annoying at times. The depiction of the three brothers' relationship was a mixed bag. While there were instances where their brotherhood shined and offered glimpses of potential, it ultimately fell short of delivering a truly compelling dynamic.

8415,The Killing Vote,"Drama, Mystery, Crime",7.5,"The Killing Vote drops the plot and never quite picks it up.

Don't get me wrong, this is an entertaining crime thriller. The core premise is an intriguing one. The public are offered the opportunity to cast a vote via an app on their mobile device to see if vigilante justice should be metered out, to criminally culpable individuals, who escaped the South Korean justice system. Its a judicial take, if you like, on the wisdom of the crowd. 

The problem is, this premise is never explored far enough into the series or in enough depth. What you get instead, is a tale that quickly becomes a truncated ""who dunnit"", where the focus shifts to the police's efforts to identify and hunt down the network of digital vigilantes. 

The handling is somewhat at odds with loosely comparable series, such as  Squid Games, where the games themselves are the central focus. Had The Killing Vote done something similar, I believe it would have been a far more compelling watch. 

As it stands The Killing Vote ts still worthwhile. Characterisations have depth and detail, narrative is excellent. That said, you are left with the  feeling, this series could have been more.

Moreover, both of their performance was quite poor in general, I know they have the talent but not in this drama. The story itself felt like it was dragging its feet endlessly. The ending was a weak attempt at redemption. It rushed major sections with too many skips to rush progression and conclusion but ended up creating even more problems, leaving major gaps to what could have been a very simple wrap up.

8470,Hunters,"Crime, Drama",7.2,"I'm not going to say anything about the history here. I work with that and for the most part I don't care, and this seemed like it wanted to be a Tarantino flick and we all know how he treats history. So I came into it with the assumption that the history was going to be hysterically wrong... and I wasn't disappointed here.

But I am also a huge Pacino fan, and I am a huge Tarantino fan and I was super excited about this because it looked like a fun Tarantino knock off. That is kind of how it bills itself.

But the honest fact is, Hunters is just all over the place. I think it seriously wanted to be in a Tarantino vein, but like ""2 Days in the Valley"" it doesn't exactly understand how to Tarantino makes it work.

It doesn't know how to be funny and violent without being all over the place. It doesn't really know how to make the characters and plots intersect on more than the most base of levels, it doesn't know how to make the violence fun and amusing, and that makes all the other humor fall short and feel out of place.

And then it does the Peele political thing, and I was really hoping that it wouldn't given the vibe it was going for in the advertisements... but it did, so on top of being all over the place, if you are white you are a Nazi and evil. And, honestly, I am tired of that and pretty sure that once this woke nonsense ends and it no longer becomes hip to be openly bigoted, like the rest of his films it's going to be seen as racist.","Logan Lerman, Jerrika Hinton, Lena Olin, Carol Kane, Josh Radnor","'m go say anything history . work part n't care , seem like want tarantino flick know treat history . come assumption history go hysterically wrong ... n't disappoint . also huge pacino fan , huge tarantino fan super excite look like fun tarantino knock . kind bill . honest fact , hunters place . think seriously want tarantino vein , like `` 2 days valley '' n't exactly understand tarantino make work . n't know funny violent without place . n't really know make character plot intersect base level , n't know make violence fun amuse , make humor fall short feel place . peele political thing , really hop would n't give vibe go advertisements ... , top place , white nazi evil . , honestly , tire pretty sure wake nonsense end longer become hip openly bigoted , like rest film 's go see racist .",1,1

Shockingly a lot of what is referenced in this series, really happened. This bleak platform is used as starting point to craft a Korean horror series, that's reminiscent of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and any Lovecraftian tale, you care to name. A story that not only exposes the horrors of forced medical experimentation, on human beings but also other  dark aspects, of imperialism. 

Whilst the over riding tale is compelling, I felt the monster/creature effects just didn't come across as all that real, robbing the series of a portion of its impact. 
Characterisations felt uneven too, with supposedly intelligent, often calculating people, doing inexplicably stupid things. 

That said, this series remains a generally worthwhile horror watch, for those with a stomach for it.

8504,Juvenile Justice,"Drama, Crime",7.9,"On one hand, it tackled some important complexities surrounding youth crime and the justice system. But on the other hand, it felt like it was hitting the viewers over the head with its message a bit too hard. They always found a way to end up being overly preachy. I guess that's part of the overdramatization? The drama had a handful of cases but these were presented in descending order, with each one being less appealing than its predecessor. I feel conflicted about some of the cast choices, but if we were to ignore that and only focus on the characters, the situation didn't look so bright either. By episode 6, they started to inject personal stories and affairs, but it was a bit too late to have proper development when the drama was just 10 episodes.

8507,Versailles,Drama,7.7,"Using the spectacular estate of Versailles as a backdrop, these three seasons follow the lives of King Louis XIV (George Blagden) and his brother Philippe, Duc D'Orléans (Alexander Vlahos). The former has been king since he was about five years old, his brother a much more entertaining, flamboyant and sexually fluid individual for almost as long. The first season sees the King alight on their father's old hunting lodge and decide it is to be his new grand palace. Aided by his faithful valet ""Bontemps"" (Stuart Bowman) and ruthless police chief ""Marchal"" (Tygh Runyan) and facing the duplicity of the likes of the Duc de Cassel (Pip Torrens) he must assert his royal authority before his kingdom crumbles away. The King also must reconcile the aspirations of his wife, Marie-Thérèse of Austria with his string of mistresses including the Marquise de Montespan (Anna Brewster) and the Princess Henriette (Noémie Schmidt) - who just happens to be the rather unfulfilled bride of his sibling. Philippe, meantime, is enjoying a life of frills, shoes, booze and having a lively relationship with the Chevalier de Lorraine (Evan Williams). As the plots thicken we move to a second series that, with the characters all pretty much defined now, sees the younger brother determined to do something just a bit more meaningful with his life, and he assumes command of the army as it starts to battle the ambitions of William of Orange (George Webster). Plots and intrigues at home and abroad keep the plot moving along well enough and into a third series that rather loses it's impetus for the character of Louis but does offer Philippe half a dozen episodes as he stumbles upon a man in an iron mask. Who could it be - and what does ""Bontemps"" know about it all? Simultaneously, public unrest is growing and the hitherto loyal ""Marehal"" is beginning to wonder if he's on the right side. On balance, Vlahos probably does rather better as his persona has much more meat on it's bones, but Blagden is competent enough in his regal role and there is quite a solid supporting cast of regulars and guests - including Greta Scacchi, the always maniacal Ned Dennehy, Ken Bones as a manipulative Cardinal, Jessica Clark's long suffering and quite shrewd Princess Palatine (Philippe's second wife) and Catherine Walker as the ambitious ""Maintenon"". The attention to detail, costumes and sets is easily the stuff of big budget Hollywood and the writing, though a bit stolid at times, delivers a cleverly woven series of intricate tales of duplicity, treason, peril, romance and sex amidst a precarious political environment dominated by two brothers who didn't always see eye to eye. It does end rather abruptly, so clearly season four was never on the cards - but it's still an enjoyable romp through French history at a time when the Sun King was at his full pomp.","George Blagden, Alexander Vlahos, Tygh Runyan, Stuart Bowman, Elisa Lasowski","use spectacular estate versailles backdrop , three season follow live king louis xiv ( george blagden ) brother philippe , duc d'orléans ( alexander vlahos ) . former king since five years old , brother much entertain , flamboyant sexually fluid individual almost long . first season see king alight father 's old hunt lodge decide new grand palace . aid faithful valet `` bontemps '' ( stuart bowman ) ruthless police chief `` marchal '' ( tygh runyan ) face duplicity like duc de cassel ( pip torrens ) must assert royal authority kingdom crumble away . king also must reconcile aspirations wife , marie-thérèse austria string mistresses include marquise de montespan ( anna brewster ) princess henriette ( noémie schmidt ) - happen rather unfulfilled bride sibling . philippe , meantime , enjoy life frills , shoe , booze lively relationship chevalier de lorraine ( evan williams ) . plot thicken move second series , character pretty much define , see younger brother determine something bite meaningful life , assume command army start battle ambition william orange ( george webster ) . plot intrigue home abroad keep plot move along well enough third series rather lose 's impetus character louis offer philippe half dozen episodes stumble upon man iron mask . could - `` bontemps '' know ? simultaneously , public unrest grow hitherto loyal `` marehal '' begin wonder 's right side . balance , vlahos probably rather better persona much meat 's bone , blagden competent enough regal role quite solid support cast regulars guests - include greta scacchi , always maniacal ned dennehy , ken bone manipulative cardinal , jessica clark 's long suffer quite shrewd princess palatine ( philippe 's second wife ) catherine walker ambitious `` maintenon '' . attention detail , costume set easily stuff big budget hollywood write , though bite stolid time , deliver cleverly weave series intricate tales duplicity , treason , peril , romance sex amidst precarious political environment dominate two brothers n't always see eye eye . end rather abruptly , clearly season four never card - 's still enjoyable romp french history time sun king full pomp .",1,1

Unfortunately, they forgot to accommodate to what a live action format might mandate.

8574,"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!","Comedy, Animation, Mystery, Kids",8.0,"I was expecting to hate this like every other human being  who even as so looked at this. I'm mean the art style really gave off that Family Guy/American Dad energy and I just thought it was just gonna be more family-friendly version of those shows. But after watching all of it, it's easily in my top 3 Scooby-Doo series.

I remember when this came out, everybody online threw fits and called the show terrible. My theory for how it got so much hate on release can be boiled down to 2 reasons. First and foremost is the art style. Yeah its not that great and I guess people just assumed the same thing I did before I even watch it. Second thing is that it came right after Mystery Incorporated and I guess people got mad that it wasn't as smart or nuanced as Mystery Inc., evening we were pretty spoiled to get that show in the first place and just hated it without giving a proper chance. Listen this show and Mystery Inc. are 2 wildly different shows and trying to judge this show with Mystery Inc. as you're basis is pretty dumb. Like judge this show for it is, not for what it isn't.

I kept waiting for the show dip in quality or become less and less funny later on, but anything it got better has it went on. One thing I like about this show are the new characterizations for the gang. Fred was shockingly really good. I like how he's more of the straight man and has to try to lead all these weirdos who don't even listen to him. He might just be my favorite iteration of the character in a comedic context and as much as I love Mystery Inc.'s Fred, I don't think he would really work in this context because everybody would a weirdo. Daphne in this is undoubtedly the best incarnation of her character. I mean what competition is there. Mystery Inc. Daphne's entire character is just fantasizing over Fred and doesn't really have anything else going for her. In this however, she's fun and kooky, something I wanted for this piece of cardboard of a character. I enjoyed most of  her gimmicks and very little of them were actually annoying. I wish I had someone like Be Cool Daphne in my life. Velma was also very entertaining. I love how she's the Meg equivalent in this show and constantly gets tortured for just existing like when everybody jumps on her back and she just has to carry everybody. Shaggy and Scooby are the ones who have changed the least out of the  others, but I still get laugh out of them every once in awhile

I've been watching much Scooby-Doo content and to find a show that's at least 70% enjoyable is practically a miracle. Not every joke lands and I didn't feel like a full episode needed to be 22-minutes and it probably be more favorable if they opted 2 11-minute segments. Also when they try to add more story driven elements in the last few episodes feels a bit disingenuous because they didn't do the work for setting up a compelling story (like Mystery Inc. and Rise of the TMNT for example) and feels a bit tacked on. But there's plenty of other episodes that are really good episodes with mysteries I didn't see coming, probably because i'm losing my edge with this guessing game. 

So yeah, pretty good show and definitely the most over-hated piece of Scooby-Doo media ever made. I can see why people might dislike, but if people actually consider this worse than ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue!"", turn out you're location I just wanna talk","Matthew Lillard, Grey DeLisle, Kate Micucci, Frank Welker","expect hate like every human even look .

They make fun of and insult each other but there is love behind all of it.  The laughs keep coming and as time goes on they occasionally dip into physical comedy, which Melissa McCarthy is very good at. 

Chuck Lorre is one of the writers of the show. He was a writer for another good show, Mom. If the show had just gone for three seasons, I would have rated it as one of the best in many years. At the beginning of season 4 (I think it was) there was a message on screen stating they hoped the viewers liked the new direction of the show.

They had Molly quit her job as a teacher. Fine. Shake things up a little bit. But alarm bells sort of when off when she decides to become a writer, because I knew immediately she would become successful at it in almost no time. That is the rule for television characters becoming writers.(but oddly enough not as much with movies.” I guess it is because these shows are written by successful writers. No doubt I am merely horribly bitter because I have written novels my entire life and not reached Molly’s level of success after a year or less. There was also some other predictable events.

8636,Maid,Drama,7.935,"Heads up: it's not an easy watch. Not for those who've been there and certainly not for people who think socialism is a bad word. It shows what you get when you build a social safety net, which assumes it's going to be abused by people who don't need it. It shows that people who work in the system, know that asking for help for those really in need, means showing up.

That they already had a long fight behind them and plenty more battles ahead of them and that you need to nudge them to accept help. Push them over the numerous little hurdles that society has created for them, being fully aware that they may not make it this time.

The series stands out in it's little quirks, like the ammount of cash available, the substitution of legal jargon with the word ""legal"" and Alex lying at the bottom of a pit. It brilliantly conveighs the state of mind. How Alex perceives things. How somebody in that situation, has to deal with all of society's bullshit.

The second thing that stood out, is how Sean can be a really likeable, stand-up guy at times. If you've ever wondered why abused spouces go back, this is the one to watch. If you've ever wondered if you're really an ""abused person"", if they never hit you - again, this is the one to watch.

But, make no mistake: it is very hard to watch at times, because it has little ups and deep downs. And the hard thing is that you care enough about Alex and Maddy that you _don't_ want to see happening, what you see unfolding and know _is_ going to happen. But stick with it.

SEASON 01:

I neither read the book nor I knew the story. So this was a surprise mini-series. As far I've heard, this one was the finest adaptation. The best ever cast and the episodes were well split with each one had a great opening and the ending. The suspense kept me alive till the final episode, final scene. Meanwhile, I made some guesses, but most of them did not happen. In my opinion, it should have been a feature film duology. Then it would have been considered one of the best film series, as well as mystery film. And the Oscars, Golden Globes would have poured in. Now it got record 14 Emmy nods and I'm waiting for the result.

Well, it all started as a normal drama about the mothers whose children are in the same school, same class. The real story kick starts when a boy who recently moved into the town with his single mother was accused of bullying a classmate girl. So the mothers gang splits up on that issue, but it seems not much affecting the children, particularly those are involved in the it. As the story progresses and episodes to come, lots of mysteries revealed about those mothers and their personal life, as well as the recent past secrets. But how it all comes to end truck with a sudden and powerful twist.

All the big screen stars foraying into the small screen were the big advantage. That's why I said it should have been a big screen film. Each one had scope for their roles. It was well balanced characters, that makes hard to predict any one direction where the story could head. From the director of 'Dallas Buyers Club' and many awesome flicks. I hope it returns for the second season, which has a very slim chance. From the locations to the musics, I loved it. A perfect mystery-drama. Everyone should see this, even if those are not into the television series. I almost gave it out of out.

9071,Fleabag,"Comedy, Drama",8.3,"Sorry I just had to write a review after seeing the irony of Timefox881's review. You do realize you are the only one insinuating that women should act a certain 'way,' which is....what? A saccharinely sweet and compliant 1950's housewife? Nothing about Fleabag tells the viewer that they should act in a particular way based on gender. Unfortunate that you missed the actual themes, nuances, and cinematic devices present in the show. Fleabag uses the fourth wall to treat the viewer as her friend, her confidant, and we witness all of the events of the show through that lens. We laugh with her, we judge her, we cringe with her, we cheer her on. She is a human being, neither wholly bad nor wholly good. She has growth too! Fleabag shows that no matter how shitty you may be, or may feel your actions are, you can always try to redeem yourself. You can apply for a loan to keep the cafe you and your friend opened from going under. You can choose not to continue doing things that have always negatively impacted your life in the past. You can choose to abandon your coping methods that you have outgrown. You can lose love but not lose hope. Of course, none of this without giving up your sense of humor. In two seasons, Phoebe Waller-Bridge managed to teach more lessons than most shows that drag on for eternity. A must watch for any human being who might want to learn a little more about themselves, and others, instead of making bizarre assumptions about a particular gender.","Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Sian Clifford, Andrew Scott","sorry write review see irony timefox881 's review . realize one insinuate women act certain 'way , ' .... ? saccharinely sweet compliant 1950 's housewife ? nothing fleabag tell viewer act particular way base gender . unfortunate miss actual theme , nuances , cinematic devices present show . fleabag use fourth wall treat viewer friend , confidant , witness events show lens . laugh , judge , cringe , cheer . human , neither wholly bad wholly good . growth ! fleabag show matter shitty may , may feel action , always try redeem . apply loan keep cafe friend open go . choose continue things always negatively impact life past . choose abandon cop methods outgrow . lose love lose hope . course , none without give sense humor . two season , phoebe waller-bridge manage teach lessons show drag eternity . must watch human might want learn little , others , instead make bizarre assumptions particular gender .",-1,1

Never more than superficially charming, Kleo comes across as a low rent alternative to the vastly superior Killing Eve and Deutschland 83. Lots of cameo style set pieces abound, with thick lashings of 80's nostalgia. Regrettably this ploy doesn't conceal an absence of cohesive, thoughtful,  story telling. 

Dialogue ranges from banal to crudely moronic and characterisations have a decidedly one dimensional quality to them.Their motivations seem equally shallow and largely, uninteresting.

9171,Vienna Blood,"Crime, Drama, Mystery",7.3,"""Max"" (Matthew Beard) is a doctor with a penchant for the as yet unproven science of psychopathy as espoused by Sigmund Freud at the start of the twentieth century. Living in Imperial Vienna - a city renowned for being at the leading edge of medical advances, he gets involved with under-pressure local police detective inspector ""Rheinhardt"" (Juergen Maurer) who is investigating a bizarre series of killings. The latter man is just as sceptical of his new friend as just about everyone else, but ""Max"" is undeterred and as their investigation progresses, both characters realise that together they make quite a formidable team combining traditional policing with the beginnings of psychological profiling. As the series' progress, a friendship gradually develops between the two men. Meantime, ""Max"" is finding his rather procedural relationship with girlfriend ""Clara"" (Luise von Finckh) increasingly compromised by his infatuation with a fellow scientist ""Lisa Linder"" (Miriam Hie) who isn't exactly reciprocative of his enthusiasm. With that romantic on/off scenario bubbling through series one, it does rather interfere with what is otherwise an enjoyable and a times quite intriguing collection of Holmesian-style dramas that look great and pace out well over ninety minutes an episode. Beard looks about twelve, which does take a bit of getting used to - but as he and Maurer start to get their teeth into what would appear not to be the safest city in Austria, their adventures prove a little quirkier than the norm. There's a little gentle humour, well augmented by Roman Kariolou's score and their habit of one saying ""welcome to the investigation"" to the other when things start to hot up a bit is quite fun, too. Curiously, they mustn't have had much faith in there being a second series as that starts with both men clearly having become somewhat estranged, and that also applies - though not as distinctly, from series two into three but these moments in the dramatic wilderness soon abate and we revert to a successful two-friend formula using this glorious Hapsburg city as a solid vehicle for crimes of murder that may have militaristic, aristocratic and/or religious aspects as well as plenty of smokescreens, superstition, paganism and mysticism to them too. The storylines also benefit from not overly involving the regular supporting cast too extensively, and when it does there's usually some fun to be had - especially from Conleth Hill as the frequently perplexed but enthusiastic father of ""Max"". Our protagonists do have (complicated) love lives, but these are fleetingly included leaving, thankfully, well written mysteries that are their best when it's just the pair of them going a-sleuthing together. There are certainly some familiarities amongst the nine episodes that I have seen - but they were always going to be quite hard to avoid given the genre and the investigative focus on the cerebral rather than just the physical but that doesn't spoil the enjoyment at all, really. Both men are very softly spoken which can make the audio a little difficult to hear at times, but the successful mix of new and the established attitudes and techniques works well and no one series leaves us bored or tired or weary.

9269,Russian Doll,"Comedy, Drama",7.4,"There is a great temptation, which many succumb to, to not only compare this series to Groundhog Day, but to rate it according to how they believe Russian Doll fared “against” Groundhog Day. Indeed, leading up to watch it, based on the previews, I was thinking in those terms. But I was mistaken to fall into that trap.

Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy, played almost entirely for laughs. There is an obvious comparison to be made here, with the protagonist (plural in Russian Doll) reliving the same day over and over again. But I felt Russian Doll had more depth. It wasn’t just magic like it was in Groundhog Day that caused their day to re-start every time they fell asleep at midnight or died (mostly by suicide) to escape the magic setting. In Russian Doll they had to navigate a dangerous landscape that seemed out to kill them.

Nadia is not a warm and fuzzy character at the outset, but I liked her wit and energy. If a male character acted like she did, I think the critique level would be less rabid. Heck, I felt it in myself until I challenged it. But as the series progressed, she developed as a person, gaining more depth, adjusting her behaviors. Hints developed that suggested that stuff from her past were playing into what was going on, and who she was inside. There were hints of explanations behind the strange phenomena, which Groundhog Day didn’t try for, such as the theory Of multiplayer universes in physics, which I don’t think I personally believe in but which I leave to the scientists.

I don’t want to give much away, so I will stop there. I think Russian Doll is imaginative with a lead character who is not easy to like, at least at first, but for whom the writer(s) were not afraid to put in some work to help us like her. I have no idea where they can go with the second series: a repeat of the same format seems unlikely, but I trust to their powers of imagination that they will push the envelope once again, and I will at the very least take it for a spin and see if I also like the sophomore series.","Natasha Lyonne, Charlie Barnett, Greta Lee, Chloë Sevigny, Elizabeth Ashley","great temptation , many succumb , compare series groundhog day , rate accord believe russian doll fare “ ” groundhog day . indeed , lead watch , base preview , think term . mistake fall trap . groundhog day romantic comedy , play almost entirely laugh . obvious comparison make , protagonist ( plural russian doll ) relive day . felt russian doll depth . ’ magic like groundhog day cause day re-start every time fell asleep midnight die ( mostly suicide ) escape magic set . russian doll navigate dangerous landscape seem kill . nadia warm fuzzy character outset , like wit energy . male character act like , think critique level would less rabid . heck , felt challenge . series progress , develop person , gain depth , adjust behaviors . hint develop suggest stuff past play go , inside . hint explanations behind strange phenomena , groundhog day ’ try , theory multiplayer universes physics , ’ think personally believe leave scientists . ’ want give much away , stop . think russian doll imaginative lead character easy like , least first , writer ( ) afraid put work help us like . idea go second series : repeat format seem unlikely , trust power imagination push envelope , least take spin see also like sophomore series .",1,1

You often hear in any police/investigation drama how they keep information away from journalists/reporters to not hinder the investigation, it turned out they were right. I liked how Oh Ji Hyuk didn't stand out as a main lead too much to allow those around him to have a space, he blended in nicely. Him and Do Chang had a nice dynamic but they started to drift apart a little bit later on. Moving on to season 2, the main case was definitely less interesting. The involved parties were boring. The investigation was slower and much simpler. There was barely any tension, not much action and thriller anymore. Most of the time they were slacking around. Less budget maybe? Throughout both season there was a very small side plot in the background regarding Oh Ji Hyuk and finding a meaning in living but the writer didn't allow for such development and, eventually, after 2 full seasons, everything boiled down that he found a meaning in life through being a workaholic detective.

9392,While You Were Sleeping,"Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama",8.41,"**_Lovely, touching, and memorable_**

_What a lovely, touching, and memorable series!_

---

**I. Story**
_a. Episode stories:_ Some of the episode stories were good but there were those which were great. Out of the total 16 episodes, there are 5 anyone would watch repeatedly. The ""legal"" aspect were good, the comedy were very funny, and the relationship between characters were what anyone can relate to.

_b. Series story:_ The overall story of the show was neatly written and realistic. It isn't your typical boy-meets-girl-and-they-lived-happily-ever-after which are usually boring and only for the ""giggles"" factor. While You Were Sleeping have the dynamics and challenges usually experienced by two strangers, turned friends, and started falling for each other yet there were some things holding them back.

**II. Acting**
Overall, the acting were amazing. They easily portrayed the personality of the characters they were playing. However in the latter part of the series where there were more kissing scenes, the two lead actors weren't into it. I am assuming those scenes were filmed near the beginning of the project and they weren't at ease with each other yet, if so, it was not a good decision. In those particular kissing scenes both actors were lacking emotions, it was ""platonic"", they were just ""acting"".

The supporting actors did well too and made their characters memorable especially when it comes to comedy, they delivered the scenes perfectly. Great job!

**III. Music**
For the whole series, there were only 5 songs which made an impact out of 14 included in the OST. These songs were played in the correct scenes and hopefully were used also in more scenes, or at least an instrumental instead of the other music they used.

**IV. Rewatch value**
I've watched this twice already. The first time was the Filipino-dub version and recently the original Korean-dub. Anyone can watch While You Were Sleeping anytime and everytime they want, it is a light drama and very romantic.

**V. Suzy Bae**

The main character are now set on their path , it is intresting to see what would be the role of our dumb brute. 5+/5

**Episode 3**: After the high of second episode, this episode forms a narrative key for our  way fwd, as all the characters are now put in perfect places to reach the enivatble conclusion due for the ned of season one, though, as a narrative this chapter truly reflects on one character, while oue titular character is just cool stoic badass. The ch primarily serves uses tried and tested tope to achieve the two things a.) seting up the villan and b) recrruiting allie, philosophy of sword and dialogue are strong as always but overall it is worst of the three, with imagery still better than run of the mill shows, but it is overshadowed by the highs of t=its  own benchmarks 4/5 Highlight akemi and his servant talking about destny and seeing reality as is. akemi decision to to conflict uncertainity; truly powerful, yet arguably foolish stuff.

**Episode 4:**  Best part of the episode is the addition of madam e of the brothel for various intrestes into the cast, shejjust drops truth bombs evreywhere.Best philosopher on the episode till now. The brothel in itself is a unique , place while watching it came to my understanding how differntly we see sex fm that in japan. Moreover I loved how the story is taking these detour , normally I would be pissed but here it makes the story all the more wonderful. the camerawork is dynamic, little flourisjhes like painiting of blood and killing of the bird are nice flourishes , that both symblically signifies the character and their ruthlessness for their goal, It beautifuly belances the strange dichotomy o the protagonists. It is here I also comes to understand how at each episode fm second ch our character is provided with various questions in these detour which shows their character in front of seemingly nothing burd=ger for them in their goal. Making Mizu atypical of powerful male fantasy enhances her character. Iloving these detours througly 4.75/5 (as it nitself is not a satisffying arc , if it hasd a better stand alone story, The ch in itself would have been a  10/10 worthy for its screen play, dialogue delivery. art direction, and memorable imagery esp that last 10 minutes sequence)

**Episode 5:** First off, I forgot the villain monologue last ch that was shakespearian. Moving on Thiis episode had the best god damn naative tghroughlin eand felt like culmination of everrything I havebeen pointing out through out previous episode. Though vosuals were stilll beautiful , but the close quarter fights while tense and interesting  gets tedious after a while. Ending of the narrative was beautiful. Though its visual opf past were not as effective as episode two neither the fight were as dynamic as in those episode , it is more than made up by the narrative thrust of the episode . Overall Better than anyother episode so far 5+/5

**Episode 6:** What is with this series , by the 20 min mark it was going to be another mindless action jhon wick with artistic flair, but the confrontation with villain made me rethink the whole episode in retrospect. The theme that is prevalent in this episode is the madma line of desire in ep4 and the theme I Ignored in epidode 5 i.e, expectations of others a v/s perception of self and how both shapes on one another. This ch carrries fwd previous ch theme and give us a narrative pay off as our blue eyed boy is healing while not giving up on their goal. How is this going to patyout nobody understand. WHile I can be sure that The samurai have much more ground to cover. As the way fwd seems bleak. Narratively it is a perfect end , but it still caught me by surprise as I have ecome too used to trash in my media consumption. 4/5

**Episode 7:** One of the best fucking penultimate episode; parallel between feamle leads are drawn , final battle lines are drawn, and we have the final twist reveal, though I don't consider the villan  a""villain"" to me he sounds like a chaotically neutral person, even benevolent to their own family, The use of voillain bgm , is effective is shocking us, but it doesn't convince me he is a villain but an opporunist. Similarly I don't know what is the stance of shogun wether he iois tyraant ior benevolent ruler or neutral. He doesn't apppear to be anything truly and that is why my sympathy for oplan is directed more twds akemi rather than shogun family, similarly my sympathy is for blue eyed samurai , becoz if he fails he will, have much harder time conquering jap. But even then execllent ch, with beautiful bird imagery of running princess being the highlight. Though still a notch less than the best ch of the series. Ah and did I discuss how gr8 is the primary antagonist.4./5 

**Episode 8:**  Perfect Finale, answered all the questions from previous sections and didn't leave any narrative thread dangling. Some Unexpected winners and reveng saga continues. Don't know what happeed to rival charcater at the end. 5/5

9423,Blue Eye Samurai,"Action & Adventure, Animation",8.5,"Today I enjoyed: BLUE EYE SAMURAI.

I would probably have missed this one, if it wasn't for my two favorite movie critics: Zwei wie Pech und Schwafel.

BLUE EYE SAMURAI is an animated series, but it is certainly **not** for children. The story follows Mizu, a young warrior on a bloody path of revenge to kill her father.

The show's title refers to the color of the protagonists eyes, which are blue due to the fact, that her father was a white man - one of four in Edo-period Japan at the time. Due to her eyes, she was a considered a so-called half-breed, not even a human being, but a monster or demon even, which her peers let her feel from a young age. She really connects until her mother is brutally murdered, and a smith takes her in and ultimately trains her in the ways of the sword.

What I found very peculiar about this show is, that for the first one and a half episode - or more, I think - I was uncertain if Mizu was female or male. I had a hunch that she was female right from the beginning, but her voice, her appearance, her overall demeanor indicated otherwise. It really took me some time to be certain of her gender and to me that means the show was doing a very good job in painting the character convincingly.

I cannot really go into all the details, but this show has it all: A great and compelling story, beautiful cinematography, both regarding landscapes and backdrops, but also regarding the characters and surroundings. Breathtaking action and fight scenes, remarkable and interesting characters, with which I never got bored with. Quite contrary: Even if the morale of the protagonist is questionable, I am rooting for her without hesitation.

To conclude: This is one of the examples where Netflix surprises with high quality entertainment, that is not just the typical bland and boring content, that today's streamers pour out like diarrhea ridden elephants.

BLUE EYE SAMURAI is a beautiful and brutal adult animation series that you have to see!

9512,Manhunt,"Crime, Mystery",7.6,"This series charts the FBI's attempt to capture the elusive ""Unabomber"", a domestic terrorist who killed 3 and wounded 23 people through mail bombs. With eight episodes and a combined runtime of around 8 hours, the series obviously delves into the lives of all the people involved in the investigation, but is mainly told through the perspective of James R. Fitzgerald, who is an FBI criminal profiler.

Sam Worthington plays the role of Fitzgerald, and the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski is played by Paul Bettany. Both of these actors rose to fame through the Avatar and Marvel franchises respectively. Both of them are strong in their performance, especially Bettany, who steals the show with his engrossed performance.

The back and forth editing looks a bit shady, and the creators of the show simply abandon that approach around halfway of the show, which feels weird. The pace also slows down a bit in the middle part of the series. And there are a few ""investigation"" cliches that are seen. The main problem of the series is that it can't balance between the investigation stories and the courtroom stories, often ignoring one for the other. A more linear approach to the story would've been better.

However, the series is definitely one of the better investigation series on the internet, and is definitely worth the eight hours of watching it. If you are still not convinced, watch the first episode, and I think Paul Bettany will do the rest.","Cameron Britton, Carla Gugino, Jack Huston, Arliss Howard, Ness Bautista","series chart fbi 's attempt capture elusive `` unabomber '' , domestic terrorist kill 3 wound 23 people mail bomb . eight episodes combine runtime around 8 hours , series obviously delve live people involve investigation , mainly tell perspective jam r. fitzgerald , fbi criminal profiler . sam worthington play role fitzgerald , unabomber ted kaczynski play paul bettany . actors rise fame avatar marvel franchise respectively . strong performance , especially bettany , steal show engross performance . back forth edit look bite shady , creators show simply abandon approach around halfway show , feel weird . pace also slow bite middle part series . `` investigation '' cliches see . main problem series ca n't balance investigation stories courtroom stories , often ignore one . linear approach story would 've better . however , series definitely one better investigation series internet , definitely worth eight hours watch . still convince , watch first episode , think paul bettany rest .",1,0
9512,Manhunt,"Crime, Mystery",7.6,"Eh....I really don't know how much of this movie is true. How many people are amalgamations. Some of the people depicted, especially the FBI agents, they seem too much to be true, too much a caricature, too good to be true. Too much in general, it sort of leads you to believe that the only character that was real was the Unabomber himself.

That being the case, it IS a series about catching the killer, and I've always believed that was the more interesting part of the serial killer movie fetish thing.

The killers have it easy. They have 323 Million people to hide out in.

The people that catch them, on the other hand, have it a lot harder, they literally have to find the needle in the haystack and, with a case like the Unabomber that haystack was the entire United States.

So, they did do a very good job of conveying that little detail, and that alone is worth watching. And, they did it without the NCIS overly techno-babble take on crime fighting that, for the most part, is too expensive to use if it even exists.

So, what you get to do is sit back and watch people solve a deadly serious puzzle. And the details of how they fit all the pieces together is displayed in an extremely believable way.

My only problem, the only thing that made me give it 6 stars is that, yeah, most of the characters didn't seem real. But, that is easy to get beyond because, this series is all in the how, not in the who.","Cameron Britton, Carla Gugino, Jack Huston, Arliss Howard, Ness Bautista","eh .... really n't know much movie true . many people amalgamations . people depict , especially fbi agents , seem much true , much caricature , good true . much general , sort lead believe character real unabomber . case , series catch killer , 've always believe interest part serial killer movie fetish thing . killers easy . 323 million people hide . people catch , hand , lot harder , literally find needle haystack , case like unabomber haystack entire unite state . , good job convey little detail , alone worth watch . , without ncis overly techno-babble take crime fight , part , expensive use even exist . , get sit back watch people solve deadly serious puzzle . detail fit piece together display extremely believable way . problem , thing make give 6 star , yeah , character n't seem real . , easy get beyond , series , .",1,1

The series starts off really well by introducing the character, his psychological state, and the world he is now in. With too much free time, no real ambition and left to his own devices, time is spent running out of ideas to kill his boredom.

All of that changes when he meets the first woman that survived whatever happened. Then he meets another and suddenly another man pops up, and new people keep coming.  
That's where I had to stop watching.

The incessant drama and insecurity of the main character adding to the complete lunacy of all the others just destroys the series. The writers ran out of ideas and practically turned this into a reality show.

9582,So I Married An Anti-Fan,"Comedy, Drama",7.42,"_""So I married my Anti-fan""_ was a light and fluffy show that was enjoyable to watch, though nothing new or too unique. If you need a feel-good, ""enemy to lovers"" or ""rich guy, poor girl"" type show, then you found it. It did have some issues that took away from it being a 10 for me.

Geun-young's character was great. She had great male and female friendships. Go Soo-hwan had no romance with either of his friends, which I also really liked. They communicated well and were there for each other but also had clear boundaries, which was nice to see. Her relationship with her parents was loving and supportive. Geun-young's parents did not push her towards a relationship with Who Joon, setting this kdrama apart from the previous show. Instead, her parents punished Who Joon for treating their daughter so horribly. In many Kdramas and Cdramas, you see the parents forgiving the guy way too easily when they find out that the guy is rich and handsome. But these two stuck up for their daughter. The story could have been better had they included more interaction with the friends and parents. At times, Geun-young was portrayed as dumb when she was technically a journalist and should be very sharp. (One scene that comes to mind is when she is drawing a triangle between JJ, In-hyung, and Who Joon but can't conclude that they are in a love triangle or when she gets lost in Japan and her inability to come up with an adequate solution).

In contrast, Who Joon's relationships were a bit more predatory. Most of the people around him were making money off of him or were people that had betrayed him in some form. Who Joon was raised by a single mom who seemed to never be there for him. So this set up a good way for you to forgive him for anything he does that is awful. But he genuinely was a nice person except when it came to Guen-young. Though he does become nicer to her, he doesn't do enough to redeem himself.  Geun-young suffers horrible treatment at the hands of his fans with no protection from Who Joon. Who Joon doesn't protect her when she gets into situations partially caused by him and the production team. When they are finally are in a relationship, he gets better about it. But I feel if you portray him as a good guy, he needs to be a good guy regardless of whether they are in a relationship or not.

The supporting cast brought talent and fun to all the characters in the show. Sung Hoon, as JJ's crazy older brother, performed his role perfectly. However, Mi-jung, Soo-hwan, and Ji-hyang brought on the charm as dependable friends. Mi-jung was straightforward and would put things into perspective for Guen-young and was perceptive compared to everyone around her. Though she had her brand of crazy, she bought to the group normal and logical thinking. Soo-hwan was a great friend and would come in and help whenever needed. He also stood up for her at work or on the field when talking to other journalists. Mi-jung and Soo-hwan were underutilized on this show and would be more interesting characters than In-hyung and JJ. As for Ji-hyang, he was the best in every way. Though he also made money off of Who Joon, he genuinely cared about his well-being and happiness. And the random clips we saw of him laughing at Who Joon and Guen-young added to his charm and solidified that he saw Who Joon as a younger brother. There is also the whole trip to Japan, where he tries to keep In-hyung away from Who Joon and tries to resolve the misunderstandings with Guen-young.

The worst part about this show was the relationship between In-hyung and JJ. The Webtoon did a better job of making In-hyung likable and JJ the villain. Had these two been likable, giving them a redemption arc would be okay, but this was not the case. Both of these two were manipulative and abusive towards each other and everyone around them. They constantly put their dreams and goals in front of any relationship that they had with anyone. In-hyung's obsession with fame and JJ's obsession with Who Joon made them mentally unhealthy. To have these two end up together and not in therapy does not make sense. They somehow mended all their friendships without doing any work to gain forgiveness or even offering an apology. They did not do anything to redeem themselves or to make amends for their poor behavior. The ending did not make sense because of this and was undeserved.

Again, it was a good show, and I enjoyed watching it. I think the main couple had good chemistry with one another, and the supporting cast was really good, even if the second leads were super annoying.","Choi Tae-joon, Choi Soo-young, Hwang Chan-seong, Han Ji-an, Kim Min-gue","_ '' marry anti-fan '' _ light fluffy show enjoyable watch , though nothing new unique . need feel-good , `` enemy lovers '' `` rich guy , poor girl '' type show , find . issue take away 10 . geun-young 's character great . great male female friendships . go soo-hwan romance either friends , also really like . communicate well also clear boundaries , nice see . relationship parent love supportive . geun-young 's parent push towards relationship joon , set kdrama apart previous show . instead , parent punish joon treat daughter horribly . many kdramas cdramas , see parent forgive guy way easily find guy rich handsome . two stick daughter . story could better include interaction friends parent . time , geun-young portray dumb technically journalist sharp .
