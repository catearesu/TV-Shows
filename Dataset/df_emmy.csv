If you one of the few, who has been living under a rock, go see an episode. | I don’t think this is the best episode of the Simpsons, it’s not even in the period most consider the best seasons (4-8), but it’s my favorite episode. It perfectly encapsulates what made the Simpsons amazing in the 90s: right amount of heart, wacky but not balls to the wall, and integrating a celebrity without it seeming like the episode was one long promo for that celebrity – fully understand the irony of that because he’s playing Michael Jackson in the episode. You can read more of my review here: https://imdgflicks.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/throwback-thursday-tv-review-simpsons-s3e01-stark-raving-dad/ | Every now and again you find something hanging around in the back of the fridge or freezer you forgot to throw away. That's how I feel about The Simpsons. 

Its humour is, in my opinion, long past its ""use by"" date, feeling stale and tired. Its a shame it hasn't been shelved as what it did do back in the day, premiering on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" (remember her?) was fantastic, witty and current. 

For myself I'd rather remember The Simpsons for what it was than what I believe its become. 4/10 from me. | The Simpsons is my all time favorite show! I am 13, and I can relate in so many ways since the Simpsons are an average American family! My favorite character is Lisa because even though she feels lonely because of her smarts, she prevails and overcomes so many ... | To address the failing quality:

The Simpsons once mocked and then it became mainstream pop culture. So that is a cause of why it has declined.

And another cause is that there is a new PC comedy trend to laugh at things. As in the audience is expected to laugh at the object itself without having an actual joke behind it. As in, ""This is a computer, Laugh at it!""

Because of that we see a transformation of the jokes. The celebrity guests were once the butt of the joke. Mulder and Scully came on and the Simpsons mocked them. Now the joke is the celebrity guest. As in, ""This is Lady Gaga,"" or ""this is Michelle Obama.""

They aren't spoofed or satirized in any way, the audience is just asked to laugh at the fact that they have a celebrity guest.

And the final reason is the laugh track comedy, in which the Simpsons has none. That is no laugh track. But now the writing sets up the jokes with almost a pause for laughter as if the tracks were there.

In the past the jokes were piled onto one another. There would be several jokes stacked right next to one another in a single event. Now it has become joke, pause to acknowledge the joke, continue.

But no ones really laughing because it's no longer mocking culture, it's no longer spoofing the celebrity guests, and it's lost virtually all of its edge. | Despite a MAJOR decline in Quality, The Simpsons is still one of the greatest Television shows of all time. Its peaks are some of the highest out there, and it has been able to regain its footing as of late. Fantastic Series.",True

The main characters are so boldly drawn and some of the action and plots so fantastical that the viewer would be forgiven for continually thinking...satire. Yet, the series stays true to a ""real life"" plot which it wants you to take seriously. Jodie Comer does a fantastic job of getting us into the mind of this off kilter psychopathic killer. Eventually, I think we do understand Villanelle who turns out to be the show's real protagonist. I'm not sure if Sandra Oh choice as Eve Polastri was a genius casting decision or an epic mistake. Either way, she did an excellent job as first a foil then a lost soul. The others, as I said before, seemed properly over the top in the espionage or police and crime genre to be recognizable yet also unique. I give great credit also some inspirational writing which created many brilliant individual vignettes and memorable exchanges. Yes, I knew these characters were not 'real' but I just loved to hear them talk. Something refreshing and surprising. | Really rough.

I stopped watching after Season 1 as I was devastated lol kinda. Only 2015 I decided to continue watching and got addicted like it seemed complicated at first, too many stories and characters. I even used a guide from internet like family tree per house while watching or GOT wiki so I can have more background on the characters. For a TV series, this show can really take you to a different world and never knowing what will happen. It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe). I have never read the books but the show is entertaining and you will really root for your faves and really hate on those you hate. 

Fantasy, action, drama, comedy, love...and lots of surprises! | Cruel, bloody, vulgar, Machiavellian, unrepentant. And that is just the writing. The camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery. 

And all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting I've ever seen. From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery. | LOTR meets House of Cards. Imagine a fantasy novel if all of the beasts and mythologies were transported to the real world. There's no such thing as a happy ending, or an ending for that matter (unless you're dead). So as you watch the show make predictions, draw conspiracy theories, and watch them blow up in your face. This show is that kind of a ride! | This series starts off like some of the best out there. Although it makes some minor adjustments, it follows the story from the books quite faithfully for the first 4 seasons. And adds a twinkle of big budget movies, and great cinematography. Truly awesome. Up until this point, I was in love with the series, a 10/10. I quickly read all the books, and re-watched all seasons before a new one would come out.

However, from season 5 and onwards, it starts going downhill. They ran out of book-material, and it shows. Everything starts focusing on the big set-pieces, characters become extremely bland and predictable. From here all major characters receive plot-armor, which was one of the things it didn't have before, and that made it interesting to watch. Of course they want you to think that they will still kill some of the main characters, but they're just teasing.

The last few seasons I've only been watching to see what the conclusion to this story is, but I cringe and writhe during every episode I watch. What a pitiful way to go out. Hopefully the books finish the story in a more interesting and believable way. | Before watching this TV show I was told that it's best TV show ever. I'm big fan of Vikings TV series and when I asked opinion about GOT to my friend, he said Vikings is nothing compared to GOT. All my coworkers are GOT addicts, so finally I gave it a try. I watched all 8 seasons, so I'm quite qualified to review it: It wasn't bad TV show. Actually it was quite good with interesting characters, but it wasn't as good as I was told and I personally don't agree on that statement that it's better than Vikings. Most interesting parts where around queen Daenerys. This TV show gets tense after season 7, however things don't go like we wanted and ending is awfully bad. Basically, this TV show is ruined by stupidly bad ending which leaves you quite upset. In short, GOT is good TV show (not great), ruined by bad ending. | I admit that I never saw the whole series. That said, on January last year I decided to binge watch all of it.
First 10 minutes of the first episode left me in awe and as I kept watching I finally understood why everybody loved it.
Each episode left me in shock and awe. From shocking character deaths to epic battle scenes. Some of the characters I loved, while a few I hated and glad they finally died.

Series 8, as I've finally catched up. I was honestly left disappointed with the ending - and I'd hoped they would save the Nightwalker battle for the last two episodes. Nevertheless, this series was a decent way to end the franchise.

Your watch has ended. | I decided to give this a try due to all of the acclaim it received. I smile when I remember seeing a review for another great show that had a higher rating than Game of Thrones, and the reviewer said that the other show was a good show but he gave it just one star because he couldn’t believe it was ranked higher than GOT. I thought, I guess I need to watch this Thrones show that has such rabid devotees.

I expected a sort of Lord of the Rings on steroids, but I don’t know what drug it is on. The settings and characters are realistic, and the Machiavellian plot lines seems to make sense to me for a while.  As the series went on, however, my interest began to flag a bit. Some of the characters that seemed complex at the outset, devolved into predictable two-dimensional stereotypes. And my stars, the number of rapes going on. I recognize that in such society rape was probably commonplace, but it was likely so in Ancient Rome also, and yet the great series Rome found other ways to titillate than the one-trick pony of forced entry.

So I confess I didn’t make it to the end of the show, but from what I hear, even big fans of the show were let down by how it all wound down. | **The Greatest Story Ever Filmed**

It's nothing new that HBO always have the most ambitious projects around, but from 2011 to 2019 they gradually built what I consider the epitome of quality television, and made history. The highly talented show-runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss took the unadaptable giant books by George R. R. Martin and transformed them into this beautifully constructed show, that something of it's kind was never done before. There are so many layers to this story, so many characters and story arcs intertwining with each other that it seems impossible to grasp one man came up with it all.

The story Martin created is probably one of the better and most detailed and well-crafted stories of all times, and David and Dan's transformation of the story to the TV medium was beautifully handled. There aren't that many shows when you sit and watch an episode and savor every single scene, if it's the content itself or the many small details that were precisely designed for every frame you watch. It takes a little time to get into the show in the beginning, just because it's very different from what we are generally used to. It's one of those shows that from the very first episode until the last it's just one big story so you just need patience to get used to everything that's going on in there, and after that enjoyment is guaranteed. Above all, the thing the show benefited perhaps the most of is the fact that ever since the day they started writing the first script- the complete story from start to finish was compiled in George's head. Not all the details and specifics of course, but the outline and major plot points were invented years ago when he started working on this huge book series, therefore the production knew exactly where to start, where the story is heading and where it ends, which gave consistency to the story from episode 1 to 73, without getting lost in the way with loose threads.

The show gets plenty of criticism for its deviations from the source material season 5 and onwards, but if you just think for a second how enormous this story is it's pretty easy to realize a lot needed to be altered to fit the TV medium, and David and Dan managed to do so while preserving the original essence of Martin's creation, keep the story well constructed and coherent and keep dozens of millions of viewers satisfied, and not only a handful of hard core followers that wanted it to be a page- to-page adaption of the novels. While I enjoyed all the books and didn't agree with a few of the changes they made for the show as well I can see why a lot had to be cut, things don't work the same in books as in television. Considering they knew the ending from the start and the huge amount of details you have to alter just from omitting one storyline if you want to reach the same final goal as the books, I believe it was overall for the best and they knew what they were doing, the story didn't collapse under their hands- at least as far as I'm concerned.

One of the most prominent aspects of this show in my opinion is Ramin Djawadi's masterful score which must be one of the most brilliantly unique works ever for a series (whether it's a series of movies or TV series) not only because of the compositions themselves, which are exceptionally beautiful, but also for how the music evolves throughout the seasons and builds the world of the show hand to hand with the writing, the characters and the setting as the story progresses. Also, the way each motif of the music identifies with a certain aspect of the story, though mostly noticeable in later seasons, tells a complete story on its own. Never seen anything like it.

All these wordy descriptions couldn't however describe the experience of watching this show live as it aired. The thrill, the off-season anticipation and continuous speculations, the satisfaction of watching a new amazing episode after waiting for so long, the 8-years-long water-cooler talks and the overall influence GoT had on pop culture in the time it was on TV- I'm sure many of us will always remember how it felt, and I'm not sure if we'll get to experience something like that anytime soon. I already watched each season several times, probably more than any other show or movie, and I never get tired of any of it, if it's the well constructed dialogues or blood pumping action sequences. I definitely see myself still constantly revisiting seasons every once in a while from now until further notice.

I think the success of the show speaks for itself- the countless awards, high acclaim from casual viewers and critics alike, the major fan following, it's influences on the television landscape and on culture in general- it's a winner in all fronts. In my personal opinion it's the greatest television series ever made, but generally speaking I think it's safe to say this show is for the ages and I think it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest cinematic works ever produced. Even almost 2 years after the show ended, it still remains one of the most popular and in-demand shows in the world, which I find pretty amazing. I just hope the uproar on social media will calm down eventually so we can once again all enjoy this show together. People tend to use this word too cheaply these days, but I wouldn't say Game of Thrones is anything short of a masterpiece. | Simply the best, except last season. | Starts out exciting and engaging with complicated and likable characters leading the way for the viewer. Lots of sex, lots of nudity, plenty of dragons and magic and gory battles. But as the story goes on, most of the likable characters die off or become emasculated, so you're oddly left rooting for those who were once the loathsome the antagonists to put the ""good chicks,"" whoever they are, out of their misery. From season 3-ish the series takes a wild turn stray of the original book series, the fault of the creator who couldn't keep up with the writing. Did it turn out for the better in the series, or not? That's up for the viewer to decide, that is, if one cares about the leftover matriarchy enough to find out. No spoilers, but the end seemed to leave fans of the series rather underwhelmed. | Well, two thumbs up for the nudity, that holds my interests...honestly. I'm not ashamed to say it.

And the acting was good.

But I have a problem with fantasy. World building, world building, world building, world building, and that is coupled with gibberish, gibberish, gibberish, and, by the time it gets around to the thick, juicy, meat of the plot...it lost me.

I really don't care about the world building, I'd rather jump right in to the plot and not deal with the nonsense. Oh, they have wolves that aren't exactly wolves... I don't care. They have dragons, that's cool but... too much time was spent about why they are so rare and... I don't care, they have dragons, they are rare, just stop the world building and go back to the murder and intrigue.

I honestly preferred Rome, Deadwood, the Sopranos, all the other shows that didn't have to sacrifice so much to world building. | **Game of Thrones: A Cinematic Masterpiece**

⚔️👑 #GameofThrones #EpicTV | **A series so massive and absorbing that it seems small on television.**

What can we say about a television series that everyone has said everything about and that, over almost a decade, has collected almost every award it could win? Nothing special. Only that he fully deserved all the awards and public esteem he acquired. Each season deserved, in itself, its own review, but I feel that there is no point in adding more than this small text about the overall work done. Almost everyone has seen the series, and the praise is known to everyone.

The numbers behind this series are overwhelming. With each episode costing millions of dollars to make, a luxurious cast and a script so complex that it requires the public's full attention, we are faced with a work that seems worthy of the cinema and is better than many large-production films we have already seen. . The story told is based on the epic fantasy books written by George R. R. Martin, who actively collaborated on the series and is one of those most responsible for the script, heavily inspired by loose pieces of medieval European history. About this, it is necessary to understand one thing: despite the inspirations and violence and rivalries that were in fact common in medieval times, at no point does the series try to be a portrait of medieval Europe, it is absolutely fiction and should be seen that way : For example, the series pays some attention to heraldry and the genealogy of noble families, but very few heraldic shields were made according to the simpler rules of true heraldry.

The production and visual effects of the series are one of its strong points: the episodes are so good and impactful that it is difficult to imagine how anything better could be done. All the technology used is state of the art today, and no savings were made in the resources made available to creators. Filming took place across Europe, from Ireland to Spain, passing through Morocco, England and Croatia, taking advantage of the best of locations that, in themselves, are entirely worth a visit for any tourist. The sets could not have been designed with greater attention to detail, and the same can be said of the luxurious costumes for the main cast and thousands of extras. The photography, the filming, the editing, everything was thought out on a large scale. The soundtrack, based on the main song and some other magnificent melodies, is one of the best I've ever seen on a television program.

The actors are immense throughout the eight seasons, and we can hardly say anything negative about any of them. We may disagree with the choices in the script, with the way the characters were developed, but the actors were completely up to these challenges and managed them wonderfully. We can also criticize, with some fairness, the graphic brutality of certain scenes, the excessive nudity and the abuse of the sex scenes. This is the negative criticism with which I tend to agree most easily, not least because I don't see anything in these scenes that would be indispensable to the plot in most cases (I would highlight, as one of the exceptions, Cersei's nudity during her punishing walk through the streets of King's Landing).

On a positive note, I would highlight the impeccable effort of Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster Waldau, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Alfie Allen, Isaac Hempstead Wright and Rory McCann. Not only did they play incredibly well, they gave their characters the dramatic and psychological evolution they needed. It is also fair to congratulate Sean Bean, Kit Harington, John Bradley, Conleth Hill, Aidan Gillen, Carice van Houten, Charles Dance, Natalie Dormer and Jack Gleeson, who had much more stable and fixed characters in their hands. Some were more cliché (the case of crazy King Joffrey), but each actor deserves praise. | HBO's sprawling fantasy epic, Game of Thrones (2011), isn't for the faint of heart. It plunges viewers into the harsh, mysterious world of Westeros, a land steeped in ancient traditions and brutal power struggles. What truly elevates the series, however, is its ability to leverage this captivating setting to explore complex, often disturbing, facets of humanity.

The series excels at world-building. Westeros feels tangible, its vast landscapes and intricate political machinations drawing you in. There's a constant sense of unease, a feeling that something dark lurks beneath the surface. This unsettling atmosphere is masterfully used as a backdrop to explore very real, contemporary issues – the lust for power, the devastating consequences of war, and the depths of human cruelty.

Be prepared, however, for characters who are rarely one-dimensional heroes or villains. Game of Thrones thrives on moral ambiguity. You'll encounter characters who are capable of immense kindness and horrific acts in equal measure. This can be a harsh and even disgusting reality to grapple with, but it's a testament to the show's writing and acting that it can evoke such strong emotions. You'll find yourself feeling deeply invested in the characters' fates, celebrating their victories and mourning their losses.

The emotional rollercoaster is a defining aspect of Game of Thrones. It's a series that demands your full attention, rewarding viewers who stay the course with an unforgettable journey filled with heart-pounding battles, shocking twists, and moments of genuine beauty. While the later seasons may not have lived up to the sky-high expectations set by the early installments, the overall experience remains undeniably gripping.

In conclusion, Game of Thrones is a landmark television achievement. With its rich setting, unflinching portrayal of human nature, and ability to evoke a wide range of emotions, it's a series that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Just be prepared for a wild ride, filled with both exhilarating highs and soul-crushing lows.",True

Honored, with a bow. | # One of the best TV dramas in recent memory
<b>First, a disclaimer:</b> I've not read Dicks' original version of <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>, nor do I intend to read it. I am judging the show entirely on its own merits, without any influence or critiquing related to the novel.

## On to the review!

I'm going to keep this short and simple, so you don't have to read a shit-ton of stuff and so that I don't write any spoilers. Here's what you need to know:

As a sci-fi story, <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> falls a bit short. The showrunners tried to wrap up the sci-fi bit at the end, but they did a pretty piss-poor job. Budget cuts? Rushed delivery? Who knows? Fortunately, the sci-fi aspect of this story isn't actually what makes it great.

What makes <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> great storytelling and great television is the alt-history and the in-depth character story arcs; in particular, the story of the Smiths—the highest-ranking family in the Nazis' American Reich—is absolutely fantastic. In John and Helen Smith, we get to explore what it might have meant for regular Americans to throw their lots in with the Nazi Party had the Axis powers won WWII. Through dialogue and flashbacks, we get to see how joining the Nazi Party twisted both John and Helen into persons unrecognizable from their alt-world selves. Truly, the Smiths' story arc was easily my favorite, and it is the backbone of the show. You will never feel sorry for John or Helen, but you will understand them—and you will feel sorry for their children.

Add to this mix some solid intrigue and action, plus a strong, capable female protagonist, and you will see why <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> is really good television.

Also, don't let my initial talk of the sci-fi component scare you off. The showrunners may not have done a great job of resolving that part of the story, but the characters' stories were all resolved to my satisfaction. (Well, with one exception, but...it didn't ruin the show for me.)

I recommend this show highly to people who enjoy:

- Military fiction
- Historical fiction
- Alt-historical fiction
- [Light] sci-fi
- Political intrigues/dramas/thrillers | So, the problem that we are facing with this is that the episodes exceed the story. It's the same problem that a LOT of television shows on streaming services suffer from. They have a few too many episodes for the story they are telling in the season.

About 8 episodes per season and about 5 episodes of actual story. The result is so much filler that it seems to drag and not really accomplish anything of value.

However, the story is interesting, as is the world that it is set in. Unlike A Handmaiden's Tale, or really, a lot of other shows, it doesn't feel like you are being lectured to.

But it does feel like it dragged. All they needed to do was lesson the amount of episodes to fit the story, or add a subplot or two more and it would have been a killer show.

Instead, the result is a good show that has been stretched until it's paper thin

And then season 3 hit and what was good was replaced with woke messaging. And the lectures became nonstop.

Both shows depict this character trying to wash away their murderous tendencies and have a quote-unquote normal life, but failing at that at every turn. Barry, however, is significantly more… wholesome. There’s no stalking, he develops real connections with people, and at the heart of it, the show is a comedy.

It was humorous, informative and the donations they collected went to a charity, not to buy a jet for an evangelist.

Not one single character was likeable or possessed any redeeming features. In fact, each was a one dimensional cardboard cut-out.

The protagonist was simply irritating and I was hoping that she would just stay dead and not come back, to be honest. It was all just so pretentious, badly executed and not a patch on Groundhog Day, which grabs you from the start and is also very humorous.
This is neither humorous or hooks you, at least for me. | There is a great temptation, which many succumb to, to not only compare this series to Groundhog Day, but to rate it according to how they believe Russian Doll fared “against” Groundhog Day. Indeed, leading up to watch it, based on the previews, I was thinking in those terms. But I was mistaken to fall into that trap.

Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy, played almost entirely for laughs. There is an obvious comparison to be made here, with the protagonist (plural in Russian Doll) reliving the same day over and over again. But I felt Russian Doll had more depth. It wasn’t just magic like it was in Groundhog Day that caused their day to re-start every time they fell asleep at midnight or died (mostly by suicide) to escape the magic setting. In Russian Doll they had to navigate a dangerous landscape that seemed out to kill them.

Nadia is not a warm and fuzzy character at the outset, but I liked her wit and energy. If a male character acted like she did, I think the critique level would be less rabid. Heck, I felt it in myself until I challenged it. But as the series progressed, she developed as a person, gaining more depth, adjusting her behaviors. Hints developed that suggested that stuff from her past were playing into what was going on, and who she was inside. There were hints of explanations behind the strange phenomena, which Groundhog Day didn’t try for, such as the theory Of multiplayer universes in physics, which I don’t think I personally believe in but which I leave to the scientists.

I don’t want to give much away, so I will stop there. I think Russian Doll is imaginative with a lead character who is not easy to like, at least at first, but for whom the writer(s) were not afraid to put in some work to help us like her. I have no idea where they can go with the second series: a repeat of the same format seems unlikely, but I trust to their powers of imagination that they will push the envelope once again, and I will at the very least take it for a spin and see if I also like the sophomore series. | First season is one of the most captivating shows I have watched, starting with the main characters and plot that never completely crystallises, but makes openings for theories to be made by the viewer. Natasha Lyonne creates a multifaceted, captivating character that is not fuzzy or particularly humorous, which could also be said for the show itself. Comparing it to a romcom like Groundhog Day is as irrelevant as comparing any other Romantic Comedy to a Mystery Thriller or Drama. They are not in the same league, and they never strived to be.",True

the handmaid's tale,"Drama, Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Set in a dystopian future, a woman is forced to live as a concubine under a fundamentalist theocratic dictatorship. A TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel.",True,14.0,8.2,209.619,2779,US,2017-04-26,True,Returning Series,5,56,50.0,"****From June to Offred: A 21st century slave tale!**

**SEASON 01:****

I was not sure to give it a try, in the end I just went on. The reason was, another dystopian theme. It was a short season with the 10 episodes, and I've got a mixed feeling. It was based on the 30 year old novel of the same name. I mean 3 decades old source is very old in the present trend. Since that book there were plenty of films, series were made similar to that theme, including one feature film adaptation. I don't know the screenplay was highly borrowed from its original source, but all I expected was alterable.

Even though I felt familiarity, I enjoyed watching it. My issue was the drag. The whole season was a drag. Dragged to have one more season, or maybe more in the future. Especially I was very disappointed with the season finale. It only felt like a mid-season finale and yet a lot more to come in the same season. But that was only my assumption, this season ended at the halfway. They had held back too much to have some of it in the upcoming seasons. That's very intense move from the production perspective, but for the viewers, it left with unsatisfying.

The plus points were the casting and production. Elisabeth Moss was very good. Her expressions saved in parts of the earlier episodes. Particularly, her smile during those circus were going on, instead of being tensed and confused. That reveals the character, who wants to stay alive for a reason. As the story progresses in the next episodes, you would know more reasons why. Alexis' part was short, as well as many others. The overall the characters design was good. But I anticipated more from the story side to reveal.

In the near future, the humans had lost fertility capacity, excluding a very few men and women. Those who are capable of having babies are taken as slave surrogate mothers, after separating from their husbands and kids, to assign them those who desire to have children. This tale follows Offred, who is one of the maids. Her struggle against the couple who took her in, and overall society, how it treated her and others like her. The American dreams are gone. Many fled to Canada and yet some are trying to make it there. But Offred is not concerned about that. She now has to find her daughter before planning anything.

Each epidoe was decent, but only a couple of them were top class. At least now we know what to expect from the follow-up season. Also the perspective of the story was very restricted like everything was from Offred. The episode like 'The Other Side' really made it interesting. We need more those kind of explanation of what's going on on the other side. Especially for a television series, they have all the time to detail out from all the angle. That's what I like in the series, otherwise I'm always a film fanatic, love to watch short and sweet tales. So I'm waiting for the season 2.

_7/10_ | The Show is great! i will admit when my wife said i have a show we should watch i thought what is this? but after the first episode I was hooked. 
I recommend this show but it is quite confronting and if you have trouble with that type of thing it may not be for you. | Every now and then a production comes along that such an absolute gem, it has you lost for words.

A Handmaids Tale, is based on the novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood . I have not yet read the book but if this series is anything to go by, it will, I'm sure, make its way into my collection very soon.

On the surface the premise behind the series seems novel. Yet when you consider the fate of women in contemporary and historic theocratic societies, its not so far fetched. Indeed, what Atwood has rather cleverly done, is transplant aspects of life in theocratic societies, most notably Medieval Europe and Puritan colonial America, into a futuristic setting using civil war as a vehicle. A biological imperative is introduced too, in the form of pollution induced human sterility. Fertile women in Gilead (formerly the USA) are reduced to human incubators, their only imperative to produce children.

On face value, this might seem to be a story about the subjugation and commoditization of women. Indeed, it is that. Yet, what this series is ultimately about is the hypocrisy of intolerance. Not just women but any individual or group, who diverge from the rigid religious script, meet a grim fate. Meanwhile, those controlling the dialogue, are more or less free to make and break their own rules, as they see fit. Even those who do follow the societal script, often do so for reasons that are in opposition to those they claim to uphold.

For my money everything about this series is superb. Elizabeth Moss is a wonderful, off beat choice, for Offred the handmaid to a powerful commander, who is directly responsible for hers and others suffering. Joseph Fiennes, is capable in the role of the superficially charming but emotionally empty commander.

Update: Yes a decent series but, for my money, its run on too long and now simply appears to be recycling the original script with a few twists and turns. At times, in my opinion, perilously close to looking like misandry, too. 

In short, an engrossing, thoughtful and engaging series but it needs to come to a close, as it no longer has much more to say, that has not already been said.  | This is one messed up TV show; about a dystopian America ruled by a misogynistic government.

Elizabeth Moss' performance though was pretty good.

While I don't condone the mistreatment of women in the series, I do praise it for popularity nonetheless.

I wonder what the conclusion of the show will be like? | People are going to look back at the Censorship decade and think that this and Harry Potter are the only two books the cancel culture freaks read...

... and then realize that they were both adapted for the screen.

This was good when they made it for HBO in the 1990s when it had an actual plot and was actually pro-Atwood.

Only the people that made this turned on Atwood during #MeToo when she spoke out in favor of Due Process and then it slowly started to distance itself from her IP... as it became more and more in your face political.

And that is when things like this lose me. | Stupid liberal leftist show where conservative people are vilified as some monsters while those ""innocent"" leftist liberals are portraited as victims and funny thing is that in reality it's the opposite.",True

Why, for example, would an isolationist ex CIA operative rely on the very organisation he betrayed arrange his escape and that of Hanna? Especially given the emphasis he places on independence and a ""trust no one"" mentality? Not to mention his extensive contacts. 

Its these flaws the pull this series down to a degree which is a shame as it captures the discordant, unsettling atmosphere of the original movie nicely.

As of 2018 The edginess is gone. There are no risks in the jokes. They all consist of two things, 1. Trump is bad. and 2. This was a thing, remember it?

Neither of those really work for me. Make fun of Trump all you want, but do it with a punch line. Most of the time they forget the punchline. Simply not liking him is NOT a punchline. You have to exaggerate something, make it satire, mock it in some way. I don't even care if it's a cruel mockery...so long as it doesn't seem like they are just stating an opinion.

Again, if they had a punch line, if they said something about what they were asking me to remember, then it might be funny...but they don't. The jokes are literally ""this was a thing, laugh at it."" and that's not funny. It has to be followed up with something.

Not every season has had great writers or talent, some actors have been much more successful than others, and yet it has always found an audience. My favourite era of the show was the mid 2000s with Bill Hader and Andy Samberg, but most people have a a preference for whatever season they had as a teenager.

A once great show which slowly starts to diminish around season 4, unfortunately. By the 9th season it seems as though the pen and paper have been handed over to teenage fans of the show...Decent background noise.

**To conclude.**

This show was once incredible, and something fresh, even at times brilliant. I couldn't wait for each new episode. Now, I watch it when it becomes available on a streaming service, and, on rare occasion you get a great episode, but it's not worth devoting a weekly schedule and sitting through all the fan-fiction episodes and story lines to get to the good stuff. The show can still be enjoyable, without question, though I find it better suited as background noise while doing work instead of must see TV that you're excited to tune in as it airs each week. It's now just another average sitcom which has been dumbed down for the masses quite considerably. At this rate, the show will probably end with Penny having Sheldon's child to fulfill the most commonly seen teenage fan-fiction. | I did not start watching this sitcom until the show end3d, but I had the good fortune to watch the episodes of all 12 seasons in order. I don’t agree with another review I saw that said the show had slipped over time. Rather, it is a consistently great show, as all of Chuck Lorre’s efforts seem to be, sort of comedy’s answer to Aaron Sorkin’s dramas.

Mind you, I had some minor issues with it. I really got tired of Sheldon’s attitude and antics, but that 2as counterbalanced by the slow and careful ways he also showed character growth. Similarly, all of the characters exhibited realistic growth in their attitudes and behavior. The writing was usually strong, even during the few shows that I would classify as clunkers— plots that didn’t work for me. I am impressed that the show never jumped the shark, but rather stayed true to itself. Some long running shows can’t resist doing it, such as when Happy Days changed the Fonz from a cool dude to a combo superhero/cartoon character who could do almost anything, it seemed.

I never finished the second one as i write this.

I can easily say that Season 1 of this show was absolutely stunning. Some of the finest TV Crime hours of my life. We have Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in some of their best roles of their career. Especially the latter of them. McConaughey made the talk of the town with his role as the smart, and deeply intellect detective Cole and to be honest, i have rarely seen a role played out so well by an actor in years. He absolutely grabs you in and keeps you there for the entire show.

It is all set in the rural deep humid swamps of Louisiana. The photography here is top notch. It is shot in a way that you can actually smell the place while watching. It just brings you that close to the swamps of the south.

Featuring a great selection of music by T-Bone Burnett who scored Coen´s brothers ""O´Brother Where Art Though"" to critical acclaim. He is the number one man to bring in for some true Americana music to movie and TV projects. He seldom fails. It opened eyes to many new artists for me.

The show has a great momentum until the end. Somehow the end of the season, i felt, was very rushed and simplified. In my opinion, could been done smarter to justify the rest of the show. But that is just nitpicking. For why bother the rest of the show is near perfection in TV making and gives you so much to weigh in on. You should not miss it at all. It will leave you wanting to smell the swamps even more after the last episode.
Shame about Season 2 that was a bit of a disappointment to me. Although entirely unrelated to the Class-A first season.

This show has something going on for it that if it's for you, it'd take you to some different level of analyzing yourself and life altogether and if it ain't, then it's your bad luck I'd say.It just grips you from your soul; questions you on every single thing you believe in; plays with your emotions, thoughts; breaks you apart; gather the pieces back up and turns you into a different person.Still confused, aloof, lost, but a bit better I suppose. Everything linked with the show is a genius.The cast, even the tiniest of characters, the lingering music, the locations, the setting, the writing, the story, the direction, everything about it was just flawless.It didn't matter to me whether they were ever gonna solve the murders at all, but just the way the whole thing was building up, watching it all was plain bliss. Only watch this show if you have the taste for something dark, slow paced, deep, layered, intense, but satisfying and fulfilling.I haven't seen anything like this ever though in any genre.This is something that's gonna stay with you for a long long time. And hats off to Woody Harrelson ""Martin Hart"" and Matthew McConaughey ""Rust Cohle"" for giving us the pleasure of watching something like this..

A murder mystery set in small-town southern America, focusing on a dedicated cop who drinks too much, letting the case burrow under his skin and destroy his personal life as he chases answers across multiple time periods. But underneath, it's about more than that – it's about personal demons, good and evil, the soul, American identity, memory, time. And as the case progresses, a conspiracy slowly comes into focus. There may even be a supernatural element. Thus was the first season of _True Detective_. And thus is the third. With one major difference – season one was ground-breaking, one of the finest seasons of TV ever made, a defining early example of prestige TV. Season three, on the other hand, is, well…put it this way, of all the shows I've ever seen, season three of _True Detective_ is one of them.

Okay, okay, I'm being flippant. But there's no denying the similarities between seasons one and three. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing – I mean who would want a repeat of the horrendous and universally panned second season? So creator/writer/showrunner Nic Pizzolatto returning to his roots for the third outing is, on paper anyway, a good idea. The problem is that because this season is _so_ similar to season one, it's practically crying out for people to judge it in the light of those glorious episodes from 2014. And the contrast is not flattering.

This being _True Detective_, there is a lot to praise – the aesthetics are top-notch, the sense of place is palpable, the acting is off-the-chart brilliant. And there are some interesting themes – racial tension, journalistic ethics, marriage, fatherhood, the shadow of the Vietnam War, old age. But this being Pizzolatto unfettered, there's a lot to criticise too – the glacial pace, the under-written female roles, the cod-philosophy, the (toxic) machismo, the clichés, the dreadful finale. The fact is that Pizzolatto (a novelist by trade) needs an exceptional director to turn his ideas into something resembling brilliance, to imbue his relatively quotidian script with a portentousness well beyond the written word. He needs a director with a keen enough vision to mask the fact that his scripts are actually pretty by-the-numbers. Season three illustrates this beyond all doubt. Season one had the vision of Cary Joji Fukunaga (_Beasts of No Nation_, _Jane Eyre_, _Maniac_) who brilliantly directed all eight episodes, presenting a very thin story by way of such unforgettable and unsettling imagery that it made everything feel deeper and more profound than it really was. Season three has such a vision for two episodes; the first two, which are directed by Jeremy Saulnier (_Blue Ruin_, _Green Room_, _Hold the Dark_), who was also a showrunner until he abruptly departed after clashing with Pizzolatto (look out for a stunningly beautiful night-time shot of a search party walking through a field, torches moving in front of them – Sauliner gives the image a haunting fairy-tale-like quality). After these two episodes, directorial duties were split between Pizzolatto himself and journeyman TV director Daniel Sackheim. Season three without Saulnier (or Fukunaga) isn't as bad as season two, nowhere near, but it's still very weak, telling a threadbare story that it stretches out well beyond breaking point only to reward us with the limpest and most poorly written _dénouement_ you can possibly imagine.

The story is split over three time periods. In 1980, in the fictional backwater town of  West Finger, Arkansas, eight-year-old Will Purcell (Phoenix Elkin) and his twelve-year-old sister Julie (Lena McCarthy) go out to play on their bikes and fail to return. When the police are alerted, the case lands on the desk of Wayne Hays (an insanely good Mahershala Ali), a tracker during the Vietnam War, and one of those guys whose mind never really made it home from the jungle, and his partner Roland West (a superb Stephen Dorff). The kids' parents, Tom (a scene-stealing Scoot McNairy) and Lucy (a wonderfully contemplable Mamie Gummer), who hate one another, insist the kids wouldn't run away, and not long into the investigation, they are proven correct. Shortly thereafter, Wayne meets and forms a bond with the kids' English teacher, Amelia Reardon (Carmen Ejogo), who has her own reasons for pursuing the case. Ten years later, in 1990, Hays (now married to Amelia and with two children of their own) is working a dead-end desk job and West is a lieutenant. In the same week that Amelia's book about the case is being published, unexpected evidence comes to light that changes everything. The Purcell case is reopened and West is placed in charge of a special task force to look into it. And then, in 2015, Hays, now a widower suffering from memory loss, begins recording an interview on the case for a true-crime TV show, pushed into doing so by semi-unscrupulous journalist Elisa Montgomery (Sarah Gadon). Talking about the case, however, stirs something in him, and he determines to finally solve the mystery once and for all.

As with the first season, the use of multiple timelines muddies the narrative waters in a manner that wouldn't be possible were the story being told chronologically – the jumping back and forward means that sometimes we have a lot more information than the characters (in relation to the 1980 and 1990 timeline, we are seeing events in their future), but sometimes we have considerably less (in 2015, there are aspects of the case that we aren't privy to, but which the characters know all about). Especially laudable is how the show handles the time jumps, employing a variety of methods that serve to collapse the three different periods into one another. So, for example, a question asked of Hays apparently in 1990 is actually a question he's being asked in 2015, with the sound bridging the picture edit; a streetlight going out in 1980 cuts to a key-light going out in Hays's 2015 interview; a shot of Hays looking through a window in 1980, shows a reflection of his 2015 persona; a single-shot scene in a car depicts the characters repeatedly changing from 1990 to 2015 every time their face is off-screen. It's really well done, and carries thematic significance insofar as memory, particularly its subjectivity, unreliability, and mutability, is one of the main issues being examined throughout the season.

Also laudable is the old-age make-up by Michael Marino (_I Am Legend_, _Black Swan_, _The Irishman_), which is some of the best I've ever seen, and is complemented by an exceptional performance from Ali. He plays Hays differently in each of the three timelines, and it gives the character a believable arc – in 1980, he's driven, confidant, imposing;  in 1990, a sense of bitterness and indignation has crept in, he has a shorter temper and less tolerance for things of which he disapproves; in 2015, he's become a vulnerable and confused old man with just a hint of his past acerbity. It's a bravura performance from Ali, who really does carry the show on his shoulders. This is not to say the other performances are poor – Dorff is exceptional throughout, with his portrayal of West more uniform and unchanging than Ali's (which makes sense as West is more of a company man than Hays), and McNairy is heartbreaking in a somewhat thankless role (an interrogation scene in the sixth episode is worth looking out for). Ejogo is also excellent, although she's shackled by the poorly-written character she's playing, about whom Pizzolatto can't seem to make up his mind. Is she an exploitive opportunist or an empathetic journalist looking for the truth?

And aside from all this, there are some interesting thematic elements dotted throughout the show. Racial tension, for example, is never focused upon, but it's always in the margins, often unspoken. When Hays first meets Amelia (a black woman teaching white kids), he asks her ""_how is it here?_"", to which she replies, ""_it's fine. It's good really, for what it is. I hear something now and then. They're all poor around here; that's the main thing_."" Elsewhere, he refers to his ""_redneck radar_"" and points out to West that they belong to different _""tribes_"". Later he queries if West's promotion was related to his ""_pigmentation_"" and in 2015, Elisa asks him if he ever felt he was being racially discriminated against during the investigations. In another scene, he snaps at a well-intentioned West, ""_please explain to me the hardships and tribulations of being a white man in this country_"". The most direct engagement with race occurs when Hays and West go to question a black man, and tensions quickly rise. Although West points out, ""_we're not going to solve the racial complexities of our day in your front yard_"", the man still asks Hays, ""_how you gonna wear that badge?_"" to which he replies, ""_it's got a little clip-on_"". If only Pizzolatto could be that incisive yet subtle more often.

So if the aesthetics are good and the themes are reasonably well-handled, why is season three a dud? Well, for a few reasons. As already mentioned, it moves at an agonisingly slow pace, and without the visual gymnastics of someone like Fukunaga or Saulnier, the story can't sustain itself – it's stretched way beyond breaking point, lapsing into repetition and narrative strands that go absolutely nowhere. I'm loathe to say it's boring, as I think that's too negative a term, but my God, this story could have been told very efficiently in five episodes, not the indulgent eight Pizzolatto has taken. And yes, I know, it's not really about the murder-mystery, it's about the characters. I get that, and I accept that, and I celebrate any film or TV show which puts character before plot, but the characters here aren't very interesting, and they do an awful lot of moaning. There's certainly no Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) or Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson). Hell, there isn't even a Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell). Hays is brilliantly played, but he's as dull as dish-water, and the 1990-set problems between himself and Amelia, which come to take up an increasing amount of screen-time, are so uninteresting and self-serving, they're difficult to watch (especially when we're watching them have the same argument for the third time). The point is that large sections of the season drag interminably because neither the central mystery nor the main characters are engaging enough to sustain such a slow-moving plot

And then there's the finale. Good Lord. Okay, the finale of season one was weak. It was the episode when Fukunaga's smoke and mirrors cleared and allowed us to see that at the season's core was the tale of a serial killer paedophile. The conspiracy went nowhere, the philosophical musings went nowhere, the supernatural hints went nowhere, and the mythology (the Yellow King, black stars, Carcosa) all boiled down to a psycho living in the swamps who liked having sex with and killing children. It didn't ruin the season, but it was underwhelming. Season three's finale is about five times worse. It's so badly structured and written that I genuinely do not understand how it made it to screen unless there's no one willing to tell Pizzolatto that something isn't a good idea. About three-quarters of the way through the episode, with most of the season's questions still open, a character quite literally sits down and explains everything (and I mean everything). He walks us through every single event and answers almost every single question. It's horrid writing. To hell with the cardinal rule of writing for film or TV, ""show, don't tell""; here we have a finale with a 10-minute exposition dump right at its heart, which literally tells without showing. I don't know of a single criterion by which one can judge that decision a sound one. The last episode is insultingly bad. 

Despite disliking two of the three seasons of _True Detective_, I still consider myself a fan (the first season was that good). But it's starting to look more and more like that first season magic had more to do with the director than the writer. Pizzolatto just doesn't have a unique enough vision to raise the show above the competition, not when he's allowed creative _carte blanche_ anyway. Much like the first season, the mystery at the heart of season three was never as complicated nor as awe-inspiring as it initially seemed, but unlike season one, season three doesn't give us much else to latch onto. The story Pizzolatto is telling and the characters who inhabit it are too weak to support eight hours of narrative architecture. And, by God, that ending really annoyed me!

Season rating: 2.5/5 | Series 2: Below are my observations after watching series 1 a second time, so now I will briefly enter thoughts after rewatching Series 2. I can’t say I enjoyed much of this season. I should point out that it is great drama; it grabs you by the throat and moves you along through the river of violence and betrayal and prolific cursing. (I am known to drop an occasional F-bomb as are my friends and family, but if they all did it this much my Thanksgivings would be quiet ones without company). Plus I was hard-pressed to find people to root for here. The few I liked had little or no power and were, like me, just along for the ride. And I found it ironic that, populated with the modern flawed anti-heroes we get a lot in modern dramatic thrillers or cop shows, there seemed to be an old fashion tendency for arranging fit endings for characters, like a sprawling morality play. But this is typical HBO fare: rather addictive even as I grumbled about my minor complaints above.

Series 1: I recently re-watched the first series of True Detective many years after watching the first time. I don’t know if I will watch the subsequent two series again, and they are unrelated to the first series anyway, so each series should be reviewed separately.

So taking series one on its own, I found it to be great entertainment, despite the presence of a massive, walking and talking stereotype. I refer to one of the two lead detectives. Woody Harrelson’s detective Marty Hart is sort of a cliche character, straight out of many other police procedural mystery series. He checks off several boxes of that two-dimensional role: cheats on wife yet applies his violent double standard at the thought of her doing it, drinking too much, breaking the law to further his investigation, with his anger always near the surface. But I like Woody Harrelson and he does give a textured and layered performance, his sense of humor and how  he cares about the plight of people he encounters (except his family, of course), helped me forget much of the time how thinly drawn his character seemed.

Of course, Mather McConaughey’s character is the opposite: he is complex, always philosophizing, capable of violence when needed but always in control. They are the odd couple of detective partnerships and they are conversely always at odds with each other while still having each other’s back professionally.

The plot is suitably complex enough to maintain interest over eight episodes, though I found the subplot with the motorcycle gang almost felt like action filler material even though it ultimately advances the investigation. And I was vaguely disappointed in the ensemble cast, particularly the rest of the detective team. We learn nothing about them as they lumber through the scenes.

The women in the detectives’ lives are sporadically interesting when they stand up for themselves. I found myself wishing that McConoughey’s doctor girlfriend character would get expanded and filled in, but ultimately this series is about the two main men and how the actions of others affect them. And of course, being an HBO original, you have the prerequisite amount of sex and female nudity.

But season one is definitely compelling  viewing, in the way The Sopranos was, however much one similarly lamented the excessive violence involved. | True Detective: Night Country is a gripping and atmospheric thriller that takes the anthology series to new heights. Set in the remote and unforgiving Alaskan wilderness, the show follows two detectives who must overcome their personal and professional differences to solve a mysterious case that involves a missing research team, a severed tongue, and a possible connection to an unsolved murder of a native activist.

Jodie Foster delivers a stunning performance as Detective Liz Danvers, a hardened and cold cop who has been exiled to the small town of Ennis for her attitude and past failures. Foster portrays Danvers as a complex and flawed character who struggles with her own demons and regrets, but also shows glimpses of compassion and vulnerability. She is matched by Kali Reis, who plays Evangeline Navarro, a state trooper of Iñupiat descent who is obsessed with finding justice for the slain activist, Annie. Reis brings a fierce and fiery energy to Navarro, who clashes with Danvers over their methods and motives, but also develops a grudging respect and understanding for her partner.

The show is written and directed by Issa López, who creates a captivating and chilling vision of Alaska as a place of both isolation and freedom, beauty and danger, darkness and light. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the stark contrast between the snowy landscapes and the cozy interiors, the eerie silence and the sudden bursts of violence, the long night and the brief dawn. The soundtrack is also haunting, featuring a mix of native songs, folk tunes, and ambient sounds that enhance the mood and tension of the story.

The plot is intriguing and unpredictable, weaving together elements of crime, mystery, and supernatural horror. The show explores themes such as identity, culture, history, trauma, and redemption, as well as the environmental and social issues facing Alaska and its native people. The show also pays homage to the previous seasons of True Detective, with references and Easter eggs that fans will appreciate, but also stands on its own as a unique and original story.

True Detective: Night Country is a must-watch for fans of the genre and the series, as well as for anyone looking for a thrilling and immersive TV experience. It is one of the best shows of the year, and a worthy addition to the True Detective legacy. | True Detective is a series so far spanning four seasons.

I find this a highly original show.

Well it certainly does indeed; the storylines and ideologies are from that of the 1970's, which are so out of touch with the 21st century audience.  If one enjoys his type of corny and nonsensical scenarios from his films in the 70's, then this series is along the lines of those films.  If one is looking at this series for the martial arts elements, then you'll be disappointed too.  There's nothing special or memorable here with just a slight homage to his classic steps and moves--again more stuff from the 70's.  Watch 'Into the Badlands' instead... their producers learned after the first season, much more artistic, dynamic and grandiose in the second season.

In this day and age when the n-word is sensitively removed from the lexicons in entertainment, media and society, then why is it still OK to repeatedly use the c-word which is equally vile, hurtful and offensive?  Just teaching and perpetuating another generation of viewers that it is OK to continue to be hateful and insulting.  This also just shows the lacking of creativeness and skillfulness in the writers' and directors' storytelling abilities--shame on them for being tone-deaf and taking the easy route.  This is not a matter of being PC, but rather the fact that the show-runners are ignorant and irresponsible in producing such crap.  Wake up folks; it is 2019 and no longer acceptable. | it was really good. It was a project that the late Bruce Lee wanted to do for so long, before his passing.

However, I am not pleased that it ended after 2 seasons, especially after where it left it! Which is why I gave it 3 and a half stars. Sorry.

Still, Warrior was a brutal and satisfying martial arts show, which would've compete against Game of Thrones. Or at least of few shows that have that potential. | I would like to be able to say I'm glad to see Warrior back on the screen for a third season but, well, I'm not. Here's why.

It was my understanding that this series was finished with season two. Season two rounded out the tale of a clash between rival Tongs in the early days of San Francisco, nicely.

The third season effectively starts without any meaningful purpose and direction and it really shows.The struggle between the Tong's is resurrected, leaving a stale feeling of deja vu. A new character or two is dropped in, along with a sprinkling of sub plots in an attempt to liven things up. That said, its not really contributing anything compelling to a tale well told. 

Adding not only to the sense of inertia but also irritation is the need to tout, the by now hoary chestnut, that is ""the message"". Alternate lifestyles, diversity and feminism are front and centre. Out of place revisionism, in a tale that's supposed to be set over 100 years ago, filled with gritty, martial arts, action.  

In summary, if you are going to resurrect a series you better have something meaningful to add to whats gone before. Warrior season three, hopes to cash in on its past success, without understanding what made the series work in previous seasons.",True

The little scenes where he talks to the camera really make a difference too his character as you see whats going on in his mind rather than just seeing the front he puts on to various other characters in the show.

Add to that some stunning performances from his wife and various other politicians and journalists and you have a cracking show that grips you from beginning to the end.

The quality of the videography is also worth a mention, this show is probably the best looking in 4K I have ever scene with great lighting and locations.

Recommended! | ""If you can tell a taut, precise story in one episode, stretch it out into a slack, incoherent, tedious season instead"" seems to be this show's motto. House of Cards has good ideas and good actors, which it fails in its execution, with poor scripts and poorer editing. The story could have easily been told in half the time, and would have been all the better for it. This TV series is, like so much in the original Netflix stable, cattle feed for its undiscerning subscribers. | Seasons 1 and 2 are a 9.7/10.
Seasons 3,4 and 5 are around an 8/10.
And season 6 was a 6.3/10, unlike most people I didn't hate the last season even tho the ending was pretty underwelming. The show is an 8/10. | Wow! I have never stopped watching a series before this one. Even some of the paltry tripe like ""Dante's Cove"" or ""Game Of Thrones"" I managed to watch the series. But I watched the first season of this into Episode 10, where Frank kills Peter, and I just. Couldn't. Stand it. I ejected the blu-ray and have put up the series on Ebay for sale. I'll let someone else suffer.

NO ONE IS THIS MORALLY BANKRUPT AND EVIL (except for maybe Donald Trump). While we all would like to think that the deep, dark heart of politics is based on behaviour such as this, it is not reasonable that two people (Frank and Claire) would be able to manipulate EVERYBODY in their sphere to get what they want. Yes, there are naive people out there, but not everyone is cut from that cloth. This series (or at least what I could take of it) tries to make us believe that they are all cut from the same cloth, except for Frank and Claire. Stupid, just stupid.

To the creators of this show and to Netflix - you have to give the viewer a reason to watch this series, other than to dread every next move that the main characters make. There was no evidence at all that Frank and Claire were anything more than conniving, hateful people, because the writing and, especially, the direction gave us no more than that. And when the main characters are like that (written and directed very one-dimensionally), it makes it unwatchable because I, as the viewer, have no hope for any character in the show to develop in a positive manner or to react realistically to situations presented. Instead of killing Russo, Underwood could have been a human being and helped him into rehab, which would have effectively muzzled him anyway. But no - for dramatic effect, they had to have him killed. To what end? It made me as the viewer cringe and realize that the show was going to continue this way going forward, with no redemption for anyone in the show.

That being said, the performances were absolutely amazing, given the crappy material and direction that they were given. But good acting only goes so far. It *almost* seemed like Claire wanted to bust out when she was off coupling with her soulmate, but he turned out not to be that, as she suddenly reverted back to her mean and heartless ways.

I watch series for character development and to learn about human behaviour. I need a *hero* or at least a main character that has hope for growth and/or redemption. This series has neither. (Very much like Dexter years ago - why would I cheer or want to follow a serial killer?)

Jack Ryan (played by John Krasinski) is a Boston College graduate, veteran U.S. Marine, and in the present a CIA analyst who has been cross-analyzing databases trying to find possible terrorist activity in Yemen.

Entire Review: <a href=""https://hd-report.com/2018/09/01/review-tom-clancys-jack-ryan-amazon-prime-original-series/"">Review: ‘Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan’ Amazon Prime Original Series</a> https://goo.gl/buiKxC | * A very pleasant surprise!

We've only just signed up for Prime and this is the first series I watched. I'm glad I did too, because the action is very exciting, the characters are believable - even though they've taken a few liberties on Clancy's originals - and I enjoyed how the focus was swinging to and from the terrorists' point of view.
Krasinski does a fine job as the young Ryan. Not too self effacing and nerdy and not over the top heroic.
It's shot in 4K too and the cinematography is superb, so I'm really looking forward to season two. | Wendell Pierce is a bit.... young... isn't he? I mean he does a great job, but after James Earl Jones and Morgan Freeman you would expect someone that at least looks a bit older. Someone not so Gen-X.

But then John Krasinski doesn't really look like someone that would have ""Ryan"" as a last name.... and, like Wendell, he does a good enough job too.

John Hoogenakker, however, looks like the role he's playing, but that's really because we all expected him to be Clark. At least the people that read the books expected him to be Clark. So, in my mind, he's playing Clark and not... whatever his name is in whatever episode.

But, Ali Suliman... he does a GREAT job so you get hooked despite the complaints from those of us who really wanted to see, well, the novels.

This isn't really about the novels. It's kind of true to them as in you can see it all fitting into the Ryanverse, but it's also a lot more straight out of the headlines for the W and Obama era presidencies and made in the Trump era where.... it seems more like a show from the past.

Either way, it works and it takes a little to get used to it if you are a fan of the books, or at least the Ford movies (which also took a little bit).

However, once you get passed it, the show is entertaining as all get out and.... for a streaming show, perfectly short in it's seasons, which is FANTASTIC given that shows like The Handmaiden's Tale, The Man in the High Tower, and so many other direct-to-streaming fair have more episodes than story.

Jack Ryan just enough where the filler isn't extreme and you can rest assured that the episodes are used to push the plot along and not just be filler.

AND THEN SEASON 2 HITS....

... and suddenly it's like they have forgotten how to write a suspenseful spy yarn, in fact, for the most part, they stop acting like spies altogether.

Every episode is ""edge of your seat"" entertainment. Production, direction and actor craft reaches above and beyond all prior franchise endeavors. This is NO LIMITS Star Trek. | It's hard/impossible to find an online review of the full season.  The full 15-episode Season 1 is available on Netflix here in Europe. Access in the USA is via other paid services, at least on initial release, but American viewers might be able to catch up with this on Netflix if they travel.  Meanwhile all initial reviews are based on the pilot (episodes 1 and 2 combined).  The pilot attracted good reviews - more than the full season deserves - in part simply from the pleasure of seeing a new Star Trek series on screen. 

By the end of Season 1, it feels uneven.  There are some great ideas lurking in this, but it also has some serious issues: bad pacing, terrible acting in parts, and some obvious signs of a limited budget.

Highlights:

* Jason Isaacs as Captain Lorca is one of the best Star Trek captains: tough, bold, decisive, commanding, but also human and flawed.
* Sonequa Martin-Green is a fine protagonist and very watchable - it's interesting that the captain is not the main character. She successfully portrays an upright, capable but insubordinate character through the season's full story arc, and it's all plausible. A shame that her Vulcan upbringing doesn't come into the story so much in the season's later episodes.
* The romantic relationship given most screen time is between two men (a timely 21st century update in Star Trek's long tradition of diversity).  It is well handled: we see that these men have a strong and loving relationship and there is a deep emotional hit later when one of them is harmed.
* The subtitle options include ""Klingon"".

Lowlights:

* The Klingon race has been ""rebooted"" as a race of cumbersome, slow, religious nuts.  The prosthetics look nothing like earlier incarnations of the Klingons.  The idea of these beings as the galaxy's fiercest warriors is preposterous.  A serious design mis-step here.
* The timeline here predates the Original Series by around 10 years, but the Discovery appears to have more modern (and far more reliable) technology than the Enterprise ever did, even though this is supposed to be an older vessel.  The uniforms also look more up-to-date.  These things are going to irritate the fans.
* In an entire 15 episode season the crew visit a grand total of ... three planets.  I guess this minimises production expenditure on location shoots, but it severely limits the sense of adventure and discovery.  Even a low-budget sci-fi show like Killjoys (excellent if you haven't seen it yet) has more planets than this.
* Michelle Yeoh - I don't know if she is unwell or what, but this formerly great actor ruins most of the scenes she is in.  She can't even say simple lines correctly (her intonation is wrong and the wrong words are stressed).  If this is an intended effect then it's extremely badly portrayed.  Her character here is supposed to have a Malaysian accent (we know this because at one point she explains that she was born in Langkawi - that's an island in Malaysia) but Malaysian people don't maul English like this.  Overall just a shame: presumably a good chunk of the acting budget was spent on this headline name, and she's easily the worst actor in the show.

A series like Star Trek wouldn't be complete without its special effects.  Here again there is a mixed bag: some beautiful work with the 'mycelia' and the general space scenes are pretty, though it all seems a bit static.  The bridge and ship interiors are too sparse - Engineering lacks any sense of powerful forces being held in check by advanced machinery.  A trick shot where the camera moves from outside the ship, through the window/view screen, to the interior of the Bridge is used over and over again - nice the first couple of times.

Overall grade B.  It feels like a missed opportunity to bring this much-loved franchise up to date.  Non-fans are likely to give up on this before the end of the season, and I can't really blame them.  Fans are going to be, at least, annoyed.

There have been other recent geek favourites which have disappointed, even though they have had big budgets and big names involved. Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice is the clearest example.  I believe the root cause of these problems is that studios put key people in charge, as producers or directors or screen writers or casting directors, who are just not that into the source material.  Some people think that sci-fi fans will swallow any old rubbish.  That is patronising and it is a mistake, especially in this era of vast viewing choice.  Fans hate to be patronised.  The fans are looking for movies and TV shows made with integrity, respect and love.  Anything made with that level of care will have no problem attracting new, younger fans.  The positive audience reaction to Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fine example.

Star Trek: Discovery was - you would hope - aiming for that target.  It does have some of the elements right (Captain Lorca puts on a splendid Scottish accent at one point).  But overall it does not make the grade. | Basically, the whole thing is a politically correct propaganda show. Everyone is an independent and capable woman. The only white male in a position of power is a single capitan, his with his flaws too. The rest? Incredibly obvious.

Episode 10 is about a parallel universe in which - although the human race rules over everything, it's painted as an evil 'Terran Empire' and villified to the max. Everyone is evil. Why? Because the core mantra of this alternate human race is - listen to this - preserving their own kind (basically, they made an episode about just how bad a racist universe might be).

Ridiculous. Watch The Orville instead, it's 100 times better and has none of this political crap in it.

Our movies and show should be politics free. | The first season of Star Trek Discovery I can only describe as awful. Like the vacuum of space it was sucked dry of the warmth and sense of hope and optimism found in the wonderful 1990's series. 

It came as a relief that the writers and producers listened to fans and crafted a much improved second season. That said, the hangover from season one remains and its uncomfortably starchy militaristic vibe, has not completely dissipated. 

To add to the series woes there is, of course, competition from  the truly wonderful series ""The Orville"" which many long time fans, including myself, feel is the true successor to the older Star Trek series. Its upbeat vibe, well timed humour and its sense of optimism and thoughtful approach make it addictive viewing. 

In short not a dismal addition to the Trekkie universe but one that has a long way to go to redeem itself too. 5/10 from me. | A brilliant example of current entertainment television! DSC is not only the best Star Trek to date, it represents the best of modern science fiction, period! Cinematic in scope, DSC is more imaginative, thoughtful, exciting, interesting and  absolutely beautiful to watch than any other previous manifestation of Star Trek. For the first time we see a wide range of carefully developed, nuanced characters facing a variety of situations yet upholding the same Star Trek values of Gene Roddenberry. Have some of the 'usual' stereotypical characterizations taken back seat to a more diverse presentation of humanity? Absolutely! I think that is a plus NOT a minus. | This is Star Trek as people who thought Star Trek was stupid and didn't watch it imagined it to be. Cheap soap opera melodrama, unnecessary references to physicists, poor storytelling masquerading as lousy fake zeep zoop ork bork science. Awful. But put a shine on a turd and people will think it's low calorie old family recipe cicolatta gellato. | The problems this show deals with are pretty basic and surface level. The characters aren't complex but as usual driven by basic, human emotions despite supposedly being from other races and species.

It feels like the show tries to make every episode themed: time-travel, parallel dimension, alternate universe, hostile take-over, bla bla bla. One thing's for sure though, they didn't skimp on the visuals, because they are phenomenal!

The show does however drop you into a world that has little to no frame of reference. As somebody who knew very little about Star Trek, despite not having too many new terms thrown at you, it's not easy to keep track of which species/race they're talking about, why they're important, what technical device is being referenced, what it's supposed to do,....

On the subject of physics, they keep making the same mistake: sound in space.

All in all, it's a good series to turn your brain off to and just ignore the random terms thrown at you, don't ask too many questions about the plot, lean back, and let your brain be drizzled with Sci-Fi lite. | For starters it's dark...and that's really NOT Star Trek. Star Trek is optimistic and light even when it goes a little gritty. It's supposed to be an optimistic future where Earth strives for a Utopia...and Discovery isn't that at all.

Discovery is bleak and pessimistic and really, that's not what I want when I want to sit down and watch Star Trek.

And then it's weighted in the present, and again, that's not what I want in science fiction.

A reflection of the present is fine...a satire on it is fine...but to try and anchor the plots so much in the present that it becomes BLATANT...that's not science fiction anymore.

And then what did they do to the orcs...I'm sorry, Klingons? In a prequel series? I know they have always micro-evolved in appearance but this is insanely different.

They are so different that it's almost insulting to even the casual fan let alone their loyal base.

And then, yeah, like so many other shows it does that thing where it's almost racist towards the ONE demographic that it is currently politically correct to be racist against...and that's not Star Trek either, if anything, it's the opposite because that was intended to be solved a long, long time ago in the franchise's history.

The Klingons are the bad guys for NOT wanting the Federation to cleanse them of their culture and heritage...they are written as the bad guys for NOT wanting to be ethnically cleansed!!!!!!

I know it's a play on White Supremacy, but seriously, this does NOT make the Federation look like the good guys here. Now, if the Klingons wanted to Ethnically cleanse OTHER groups, that would make them look like the bad guys. NOT the other way around.

Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/u9pZGjxHK7c

Season 2 of _Homecoming_ recently arrived on Amazon Video. I had no idea there was a second season coming, but having thoroughly enjoyed the first, this was really good news. 

Season 2 picks up soon after the end of the previous season and takes off at a sprint. We meet a character called Alex who wakes up in a rowboat in the middle of a lake and we go from there. The connection to Geist, the company at the heart of season 1, is established early, and we are right there with her as she tries to figure things out. It’s one of those shows that keeps you in the dark and makes you work it out as you go along. It uses flashbacks that overlap with the previous season to fill in blanks here and there, and it all comes off as a great package. 

The season is well written and one of the things in particular that I liked was that just when you think you have it all figured out, they pull the rug from under you. Things they show you at one point make you think one thing, then are later shown that they are completely different. It’s a great style that kept us interested all the way through. 

Like the first season, this second one has less than 10 episodes, and they are all around the 30min mark. So if you like twisting turning stories with lots of surprises, now’s a good time to get on board.",True

This time the series moves from New Zealand to the USA. No doubt looking to tap into the much bigger US audience. That said, its cast is predominantly English and it employs Kiwi talent in the production, from the original film. 

Its not a bad move but just like the original film I'd suggest its humour will either appeal to you or it won't. I like things a little off beat and deadpan but I honestly struggled to find the first two episodes funny. 

For me I'd describe this series as more ""interesting"" than amusing. There are other series in a similar vein, such as ""Being Human"". 

That said this series is different enough to merit attention.Particularly the vampires often absurd lack of self awareness of how much the world has changed around them. Their longevity hasn't made them wiser its simply made them old and anachronistic.

And while I would recommend this show to any adult with a solid upbringing in education and common sense, it is for the total opposite end of those two traits I would recommend this show be cancelled. 

The social-liberal agenda underlying this show is without a doubt reprehensible.  The nudity, comedy, and hilarious writing cannot overshadow the concentrated subliminal indoctrination that are focal points in this series.  The formula here is the same that has been and is being used in most of animation for the last several years; that edict being, _**""Since it is 'make-believe' or 'a cartoon' it's okay to express same sex relationships, gender identity views/politics, and the manipulation of gender norms through them.  Just make with the comedy and everything else will be overlooked.""**_  (no, It won't)  
I do not know if these conditions are presented to the creator as mandatory by the company execs to get the show green-lit, or if these points are just expressions of the creator and his writing team; but the nefariousness of injecting these culturally minimal abnormal issues through a child's medium is downright socially treasonous.

Big Mouth is a marvelous show in its creation; the idea behind it is genius.  But some of the things mentioned above should not be available for just anyone to watch.  They are seriously not issues that a young mind can have perspective on and deduce comedic fun/license from viable reality.  Unfortunately people born after 1984, seem to be really, really, really...really shitty parents.  

I was not impressed with the lastest season of Big Mouth.  I especially didn't care for Maury being pregnant, Jay & Matthew's relationship, Jessi's gender assignment pronoun bullshit hang ups, Missy's black family being riddled with single-moms, gay daughters, and ""asexual"" old women, not to mention her father being a feministic ally (even though all that shit is accurate AF). I found last season's lovebug Walter being ""flamer-lite"" a bit patronizing.  And though black women do damn-near have a patent on Nasty Attitude & Bitterness, it too was a bit patronizing most of the lovebugs/Hate-worms were American afrocentric.  

Okay (whew!) Last time...If you can get past all of that, then this show is funny AF!!  Truly. There are some people, adult or teen, who can't watch this show and be entertained.  There are some who can and have a great time.  But if worse comes to worse, I would recommend--if you care about your kids under 16--that you child-lock this show.

Ever since hipster 20-somethings with a passion for memes and existentialism took control, I felt like the only one who could feel his childhood slowly starting to melt, and not realise it until one of these shows got spoiled more than possibly any show that’s ever buzzed in front of me.

Steven would be a perfectly good watch if it was placed alongside livelier, more timeless shows that didn’t have any subject matter that would fly over childrens’ heads but could entertain adults in equal measures, but it represents the best and worst of present-day Cartoon Network; characters with defined personalities, strong she-leads, smart writing and complex, human storytelling, but also humour that sees its web popularity as no coincidence, melodrama prominent to the point of becoming forced, more reliance on internet culture than any other network and diversity so broad that it becomes a tad overbearing. I’m all for progressiveness, but the problem is that these so-called cartoons are designed, written and created by the average Tumblr/Twitter user, these being the (un)safe havens for Japan-inspired nerds and crazy social justice warriors. This is exactly why I had doubts about the Powerpuffs being rebooted from the moment they announced that they’d do it.

Yes, I’m the kind of person who looks for mature stories surrounding real situations and characters with depth, and animation has provided and should provide more mature stories than so many American movie studios think it can. Animation should be treated like the kind of art it is. But animation can’t just have one single personality. As proven with all its original programming from Steven to PPG 2016, no matter how good, Cartoon Network is just too real now to even be considered 'Cartoon' Network. That doesn't mean to say that this new version of Cartoon Network shouldn't embrace influence or teach acceptance, especially in this age of a president with a desire to barricade his people against any ""terrorists"" who aren't white or cisgendered, but to do so without pandering would require subtlety, something the Crewniverse fails to recognise.

Opinions on this show are respectable, but this fandom has grown to be a clustercuss that in many cases fills in for bronies; almost everyone I know has Peridot or a gem’s meme-y face as their icon and will spoil an episode for what feels like an eternity after its premiere. Some fans will even look past the show’s morals about acceptance no matter what size, gender, sexuality, mental issue or whatnot and trash each other to the brink of suicide. I’m losing enjoyment of this show even during its best episodes not just because it isn’t as effective as, say, Wander Over Yonder or BoJack Horseman, but the thoughts of this fandom and the slow death of comedy at the CN Studios invade my brain constantly and make me feel like a bitter old man trapped in the body of guy in his early 20′s. And during this experience, Lauren Zuke Joss Whedon’d her Twitter because of fans crying like the characters in this show over their ships.

THIS SHOW IS STAR TREK. This show has heart and especially HOPE and WONDER; like actual Star Trek, not the new dystopian, hopeless, bleak, ideologically-skewed ""Star Trek"" shows now, which are filled with propaganda and gaslightng. And Episode 9 of Season 2 was one of the most amazing space battles I've ever laid eyes upon on screen, TV AND movies. Amazing. Not many shows today make you feel good, normal, hopeful—this one does. | Season one and two of The Orville were excellent and then along bumbled season three.....

Season three is everything I associated with the new Star Trek franchise.Woke, poorly written, cynical and frankly irritating and boring, in equal doses. 

I'm no longer sure how to rate this once well written, funny and generally likeable, show. Suffice to say, if season three is the direction of things, I hope its the last one.

5/10 factoring in seasons one and two. I found three so bad, I wont even attempt to rate it on its own but it does pull down my overall rating, significantly. | I originally rated this show 8/10 after watching seasons 1 & 2.
I have started watching season 3... which was a long time coming and I was really hanging out for it... I have just watched S03E05 'A Tale of Two Topas' and the first thing I did was up my rating to 9/10.
Season 3 was totally worth waiting or. I particularly love the way that the stories are carrying on from season 1 & 2 events.
I truly hope there is a season 4!!
When the series started it was too forced with the comedy moments. They were not natural, and some were to the point of being cringe-worthy. But as season 1 progressed, it became more serious and in my opinion, it became a much better program.
I don't consider there to have been a bad episode. Sure, some are better than others, but none are bad.
There is drama, action, comedy (but no longer cringe-worthy)... the stories are totally engaging and cover worthwhile topics and ethical quandaries.
I find the show extremely well cast and the acting very natural.

It can be difficult to maintain tension and drama describing true events that the viewer might be already aware of to some extent, but this program manages it nicely. It is a little predictable in how it tells the story, by which I mean it uses several angles from different characters' points of view: the scientists and administrators representing the Russian government, the employees of the power plant and other disposable workers, and of course the masses of people caught up in the disaster; and finally, for a close-up look, the wife of one of the plant's employees, who follows her husband to a Moscow hospital. All of these perspectives are handled well.

A couple of the criticisms I saw sort of bounced off me. One person on another website said it was a good series but he was giving it a low rating because he couldn't believe it was rated higher than Game of Thrones.  Uh, okay. Another person felt that the miniseries sugar coated the Communists. I don't know; I lived through Gorbachev and Glasnost, and this portrayal seemed spot on to me.

Released in May 2019, with over a year remaining of the Trump administration, a show about a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union some 33 years ago probably doesn't jump out as being especially relevant to the here and now. Except, of course, it's not really about a nuclear accident. It's about governmental denial and subterfuge, it's about the dangers of rejecting science in favour of ideology. It's about the importance of a free press. It's about lies. It's about people who attempt to speak truth to power. And it's about the people who suffer when an entire legislative system is rotten to the core.

And with that in mind, it suddenly becomes a lot more relevant to 2019 United States.

Created, written, and executive produced by Craig Mazin (whose previous work inexplicably includes _Scary Movie 3_, _Scary Movie 4_, _Superhero Movie_, _The Hangover Part II_, and _The Hangover Part III_), _Chernobyl_ is directed by TV and music video veteran Johan Renck as part-horror movie, part-cautionary tale, and part-political treatise. Mazin began researching the Chernobyl explosion in 2013, initially as a hobby. Thinking he knew what had happened reasonably well, he was surprised to find how much he didn't know, and how much the majority of people didn't know, and it was this knowledge-gap that led to the show. Equal parts political deconstruction and painstaking recreation of what it must have been like to live through the worst nuclear disaster in history, the show presents a terrifying, nightmare vision of how bad things can get when hard scientific facts are made subservient to political agendas, and governments strive to undermine not only scientific expertise but the very nature of truth itself (the Soviet Union was a big fan of ""alternative facts"" long before the GOP). _Chernobyl_ begins and ends by asking the viewer to ponder the cost of cumulative nation-wide lies. However, it's just as interested in celebrating the heroes as it is assigning blame, and in that sense, it has an extraordinary sense of humanism.

The acting is immense, the writing is incisive and terrifying, the aesthetic is exceptional, and the show was a worthy winner of no less than 10 Emmys from its 18 nominations, including ""Outstanding Limited Series"", ""Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"", ""Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"", ""Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or Movie"" (for ""Please Remain Calm""), ""Outstanding Musical Composition for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"" (for ""Please Remain Calm""), and ""Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Simon Smith for ""Please Remain Calm""). The show also won seven of its 11 nominations at the British Academy Television Craft Awards (including Best Director, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Original Music, and Best Production Design), and two of its four Golden Globe nominations – Best Limited Series or Television Film and Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series or Television Film (Stellan Skarsgård). All in all, Chernobyl is that rarest of beasts – a show which lives up to the hype.

April 26, 1986, 1:23am; near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR. Reactor No. 4 at the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant (aka Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant) explodes, sending out masses of radioactive material. Fire crews are called, but neither they nor the local people have any idea of the severity of the situation. As the Central Committee tries to keep a lid on things, a commission is hastily assembled to investigate the disaster. The commission's head is Boris Shcherbina (a career-best performance from Stellan Skarsgård), Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and a devout party-man who believes it when he's told that the radiation released from the reactor is no stronger than that used in a chest x-ray. The commission's scientific expert is Valery Legasov (a mesmerising Jared Harris), deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute, who immediately realises that the accident is much more serious than the government are saying, and that the people in immediate danger amount not to tens of thousands, but tens of millions.

The show opens with the explosion and then follows Legasov and Shcherbina as they investigate why it happened and unexpectedly form a strong friendship. Along the way, we're introduced to a sizable number of characters, some well-known, many not at all – Ulana Khomyuk (Emily Watson), a nuclear physicist from Minsk (composite character); Lyudmilla Ignatenko (a heartbreaking Jessie Buckley), the wife of one of the first-responders; Vasily Ignatenko (Adam Nagaitis), Lyudmilla's husband; Anatoly Dyatlov (a quite stunning Paul Ritter), Deputy Chief Engineer at Chernobyl and the man in charge of the control room at the time of the explosion; Mikhail Gorbachev (a chameleonic performance from David Dencik), General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; Viktor Bryukhanov (Con O'Neill), director of Chernobyl; Nikolai Fomin (Adrian Rawlins), chief engineer at Chernobyl; Aleksandr Akimov (Sam Troughton doing a lot with a small role), night shift supervisor; Leonid Toptunov (Robert Emms), senior control engineer; General Vladimir Pikalov (Mark Lewis Jones), commander of the Chemical Troops of the USSR; Viktor Chebrikov (Alan Williams), Chairman of the KGB; Andrei Glukhov (Alex Ferns), mining crew chief; Major General Nikolai Tarakanov (Ralph Ineson), supervisor of the clean-up operation; Pavel Gremov (Barry Keoghan), civilian draftee into the clean-up operation (fictional character); Bacho (Fares Fares), Soviet-Afghan War veteran who trains Pavel (fictional character); Zharkov (Donald Sumpter), member of the Pripyat Executive Committee (fictional character); Svetlana Zinchenko (Nadia Clifford), doctor treating those with radiation sickness (composite character); and Andrei Stepashin (Michael McElhatton), Soviet prosecutor (composite character).

Thematically, _Chernobyl_ is anything but subtle. The opening line is ""_What is the cost of lies?_"", and this issue is front and centre for the entire five episodes. The show presents the Soviet Union as a place where lying and statecraft were one and the same, and in so doing, it illustrates what can happen when institutions of government put political ideology above objective facts, when egotistical politicians disregard everything that experts are telling them in favour of their own ill-informed theories (sound familiar?). It is, in essence, a show about the dangers of state-sanctioned obfuscation. The first episode in particular gives us some fine illustrations of a system obsessed with committees, bureaucracy, and secrecy, all built upon an unnecessarily complicated and rigid hierarchy. For example, shortly after the explosion, Bryukhanov explains to the Pripyat Executive Committee,

> _As you can see, we have experienced an accident. A large control tank malfunctioned, damaging reactor building four and starting a fire. I have spoken directly to Deputy Secretary Maryin. Maryin spoke to Deputy Chief Frolyshev, Frolyshev to Central Committee member Dolghikh, and Dolghikh to General Secretary Gorbachev. Because the Central Committee has the greatest respect for the work of the Pripyat Executive Committee, they have asked me to brief you on matters as they stand. First, the accident is well under control._

This sequence goes from the manager of Chernobyl (Bryukhanov) to the Deputy Secretary of the Power Industry (Maryin) to the Deputy Chief of the Machine Building Department of the Central Committee (Frolyshev) to a Politburo member (Dolgikh) to the General Secretary (Gorbachev). And if you think this is an exaggeration, all of these people are real, and this is precisely the sequence of how the information got from Bryukhanov to Gorbachev. As it's presented in the show, there's nothing remotely subtle about it, as we're invited to shake our heads at the ridiculousness of it all. An even more telling example of governmental secrecy occurs in the same scene, as Zharkov addresses the Committee,

> _From the Central Committee all the way down to each of us in this room – we represent the perfect expression of the collective will of the Soviet proletariat. Sometimes, we forget. Sometimes, we fall prey to fear. But our faith in Soviet socialism will always be rewarded. Always. The State tells us the situation is not dangerous. Have faith. The State tells us they do not want a panic. Listen well. True, when the people see police, they will be scared. But it is my experience that when the people ask questions that are not in their own best interest, they should simply be told to keep their minds on their labour – and to leave matters of the State to the State. We seal off the city. No one leaves. We cut the phone lines. Contain the spread of misinformation. That is how you keep the people from undermining the fruits of their own labour. That is how your names become inscribed in the hallways of the Kremlin. Yes, comrades. We will all be rewarded for what we do here tonight. This is our moment to shine._

This speech is met with applause. There's a lot to unpack here, but the line ""keep the people from undermining the fruits of their own labour"" is especially telling. Essentially, ""_keep the people uninformed so they don't ask us to explain ourselves._""

And, to a certain extent, much of the rest of the show depicts how that is exactly what the government has accomplished. If there's an overriding mindset amongst the Soviet people, it's a sense of civic duty, borne of a genuine belief in socialism and total trust in the Central Committee. Not all characters share this trust, but enough of them do to make it an undeniable trope. And for the most part, the show presents this sense of duty to the State as deeply honourable, worthy of a great deal of respect. How the State elicits, manipulates and exploits these feelings is being criticised, not the feelings themselves – a vital distinction. This is seen most clearly when one contrasts the noble self-sacrifices made by multiple characters, often knowingly giving their lives for the State and for one another, with the callous way the politburo look on such sacrifices – they expect people to give their lives because lives have to be given. As Shcherbina says at one point, ""_you will do it because it must be done_"". To the Politburo, the proletariat is not a collective of individuals, it is a single body, and it can afford to lose a person here and there without any significant damage.

Since the series was released, much has been written about the fidelity (or lack thereof) of the representation of the Soviet Union in 1986 – whether such and such a politician doing this is realistic, or such and such a politician saying that is over the top. Without explicit knowledge of the _milieu_, I can't really comment on this aspect of the show, but what I can do is cite another source that seems to suggest the show's depiction of the extraordinary unpreparedness and elaborate web of lies built by the government is most definitely not an exaggeration. In _Children of Chernobyl_, a Canadian documentary filmed in Ukraine just five years after the accident, we're told that in the weeks and months following April 26, hospitals were trying to treat patients despite having no wheels on their IV stands and barely any cancer medication whatsoever. A pack of needles cost 10 rubles (5 times the average daily wage), so cash-strapped hospitals had to reuse syringes across multiple patients. And as part of the massive cover-up attempt, individuals were barred from owning dosimeters, meaning they were unable to test levels of radioactivity for themselves. Indeed, huge numbers of people only became aware of the severity of the problem by listening to foreign news reports on short wave radios (which were illegal in the Soviet Union). After the accident, Dr. Alla Shapiro was asked to prepare a lecture on radiation for a hospital in Kiev, but when she went to the National Medical Library, she discovered that literally every book with the word radiation in it had been taken off the shelves and classified. On May 1, just four days after the explosion, and with rumours spreading about the nature of the disaster, the government urged people to attend the International Workers' Day parades, even in areas they knew to be heavily contaminated (and once word got out to other countries, the vast majority of the official footage of the parades in and around Pripyat were removed from the National Archives). So the show may have some factual inaccuracies here and there, and quite a bit may be exaggerated, but there very much is at least an underlying truth to everything we see.

Aesthetically, _Chernobyl_ is nothing short of masterful, with virtually every creative department knocking it out of the park. The show opens with the explosion, throwing the audience into the chaos and confusion that happened. We're given no info whatsoever on what caused the accident – teasing that out will form the substance of much of the rest of the episodes. However, rather than placing us in the control room at the moment of the explosion, it is instead presented in such a way that immediately establishes that this isn't going to be all spectacle for its own sake. We initially see the explosion in the distance, through the closed window of a character who doesn't even notice it happening until the shockwave hits a couple of seconds later. It's a wholly unexpected way to begin, presenting a massive real-life disaster not from the perspective of spectacle (_Deepwater Horizon_, I'm looking at you), but from a subjective human perspective. This immediately sets up the show's interest in people. The helicopter crash seen in the trailer is shot the same way – we don't cut between objective shots from outside and subjective shots from inside, which would muddle the perspective. Instead, the whole thing is shot from Legasov and Shcherbina's perspective, focusing on their human reactions rather than the fiery spectacle.

As for the cinematography generally, Jakob Ihre (_Quitters_; _Louder Than Bombs_; _Thelma_) shoots everything unfussily, with no real visual gymnastics. However, there are still moments of stark beauty and great artistry. The second episode ends with a dialogueless scene that Michael Mann would be proud of – a terrifying claustrophobic sequence shot almost entirely in pitch darkness with the only light coming from the torches carried by the men on screen. This episode also features perhaps the single most extraordinary shot in the series – a high elevation shot of Pripyat looking down at the residents being evacuated onto a fleet of buses. In the background, the power plant can be seen still burning, whilst the people and the plant are bifurcated by the flats in which they used to live. This is as good an example of thematic photography as you're likely to find.

And then there's the acting. Harris plays Legasov as world-weary and somewhat bitter, but a man whose disillusionment with the Party was nothing compared to what he feels as he sees them trying to cover-up and play down the most serious nuclear disaster in human history. Skarsgård's Shcherbina has an exceptionally well-constructed arc, moving from emotionless apparatchik to perhaps the most relatable character in the show. Skarsgård does some of his best work here when he has no dialogue, conveying everything with his eyes, movements, and facial expressions. And then there's Paul Ritter, who turns Dyatlov into one of the most contemptible characters ever put on screen. I would never have an imagined that such an amiable actor could have made me loathe him so much, but Ritter embraces Dyatlov's narcissism, insecurity, and bullying tendencies and takes them to another level entirely (RIP Mr Ritter).

As for problems, well, if there is one, it is probably that the characters are a little too black and white – the 'good' characters are practically saintly, and the 'bad' characters are almost pure evil. Legasov, for example, is depicted as a truth teller who disapproves of the Soviet system and cares only for the facts. In reality, he was a party man, and he initially agreed with the cover up. Indeed, his dramatic testimony at the trial as depicted in the final episode is entirely fictitious – he was not present at that trail, which lasted weeks and was considered remarkably dull, even for a Soviet show trial. The same issue is apparent with Khomyuk, a composite character representing the many scientists who aided Legasov. Watson is good in the role, but as written, she's fairly obviously a screenwriter's creation, embodying multiple hackneyed Hollywood clichés. She's a fearless truth-teller and truth-seeker, a hugely intelligent woman who is far superior to the idiot men around her (how she discovers the accident is especially preposterous). She purposely gets herself arrested and not an hour later, she's in a meeting with Legasov, Shcherbina and the entire Central Committee. Such a thing would simply not be possible in the USSR. The strange thing is, she's unnecessary. If Mazin wanted a prominent female character, why not use Maria Protsenko, the architect who designed Pripyat and supervised its evacuation?

On the other hand, Bryukhanov and Fomin are presented as utterly detestable, as ignorant as they are callous, completely uninterested in the lives of their employees, concerned only with their own reputations. In essence, many of the characters are either stupid or evil, or both, while the scientists are righteous prophets. And there's not a lot of ground in between.

Chernobyl is a disaster which, as of 2020, is still affecting crops and animals – in Sweden (the first country to learn of the explosion), mushrooms, reindeer, and wild boar are still screened for Cesium-137 contamination and occasionally declared unfit for sale. The disaster also had a profound effect on the geo-political sphere, and is generally seen as the beginning of the end for the USSR, whilst also serving as something of a wake-up call to the world's nuclear powers. At the time of the disaster, the Soviets were manufacturing a missile called R-36M (NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan), which was roughly 100 times as strong as Chernobyl. By 1986, they had 2,700 in their arsenal. Chernobyl really brought into focus just what kind of devastating power we are dealing with here. At its core, however, the show is more interested in what happens when governments stop listening to science, when every smart person in the room is telling a leader one thing, and he or she decides to ignore it based on nothing other than ideology or ego (and yes, Trump's attitude to the ever-worsening global climate crisis is very much the target). An exceptional piece of television in pretty much every way, _Chernobyl_ is as terrifying as it is compelling, as heartbreaking as it is eye-opening.

And all of this is not even to mention the dogs. I'm just not ready to talk about the dogs. | I was really excited for this series as I have read a good amount about the USSR and have a personal relationship to it, having been born in a former satellite country. But I came away disappointed. The series really drew out some scenes for no reason, to the point where I felt the need to fast-forward (for example, essentially the ~entire 5 minutes of going under the core to open a valve). I was also frustrated that the series started right at the point of disaster; I think I would have appreciated more context in a backstory section.

It's a television show that delivers mystery, drama, comedy, suspense and weirdness in a way that only a handful of television programs have done. It might be the most effective 'mainstream' David Lynch vehicle of all time. The story is based in an alternate reality that parodies classic daytime soap-operas that had been popular during the nineteen-eighties. But it doesn't really parody them. More, it pays homage. The stereotypical characters mimic the same beats of actors appearing in shows like _Days of Our Lives_ or _As the World Turns_. 

David Lynch and Mark Frost show that they are masters of manipulating the emotions of the audience. _Twin Peaks_ delivers supernatural storylines and plot-devices with a flair that leaves the viewer confused and uncomfortable.

From our friend Sheriff Harry Truman and his relationship to Josie. To the adventures of Audrey Horn, Super Sleuth. To the exploits of Bobby, Shelly and the comatose Leo Johnson.

But the most unforgettable character is our central one. The hero, FBI Agent Dale Cooper. A role perfectly played by Kyle MacLachlan. He also happens to the the main character. The focus. Agent Cooper has been assigned to the Laura Palmer murder case in the small town of Twin Peaks. His introduction to the town mimics our own in an strangely positive light. This makes Agent Cooper a perfect host to an otherwise depressing feature. His uplifting nature is infectious not only to the story but also to the audience. I can also identify with his notorious love of Cherry Pie and Coffee. 

To say that the storyline meanders is a bit of an understatement. The overarching story is about a small-town girl that was murdered by an unknown killer. The FBI had been brought in to investigate, but that is where things go awry. We get Aliens, Logs, Supernatural Events, Possessions, Incest, Betrayal, Physical Transformations, Teleportation, Alternate Realities and The Yakuza all presented in a bizarre way that still leaves you wanting more. To make things even more enticing. I like to think of this world not only being expanded out into the Revival show on Showtime (2017) or the film, _Fire Walk With Me_ but also an extension of Lynch's film _Lost Highway_.

The weirdness is what makes Twin Peaks so memorable. When David Lynch is involved, it's not just frivolous silliness. Everything is a metaphor. For the most part. I think. Maybe. This weirdness carries the show into some really dark and scary places. That again is something that makes the series so gripping.

If you're a fan of David Lynch's work then this is perfect for you. If you're a film student. If you're a fan of gripping television. Watch _Twin Peaks_! It gets weird, but that's just par for course. Some people have criticized the show for going too far off the rails. It had been viewed as boring too. But its a show for people that really want to sit down and enjoy something. It's not a Michael Bay produced explosion picture and that might turn off a good deal of typical viewers. Stick with it and you will get stories presented in a world that has genius elements of noir, horror and drama.",True

Original Review
(based on the season's first four episodes handed to press)
HBO hit a massive fail with the final season of Game of Thrones, but their quality regarding TV shows didn't seem to suffer from that. Westworld is one of HBO's biggest/best series, and in my opinion, it's the one that currently occupies the throne that GOT ruled for years. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy created an extremely complex narrative, filled with mind-blowing twists, and truly remarkable character-building. Season three promised to be totally different, having in mind last season's game-changing finale, so expectations are undoubtedly very high...

While it's true that Westworld packs jaw-dropping twists, the previous seasons differ from one another concerning this aspect. In season one, the twists serve the story, but in the second one, it felt like the story was serving the twists. This resulted in a few ""less great"" episodes due to the loss of tension and of well-balanced pacing, occasionally losing the interest of its viewers. In addition to this, most twists were so foreshadowed that the last few episodes lacked that powerful punch to knock us out.

Season three goes back to basics. Last season's finale works almost like a reboot of the series regarding its environment, rules, and even characters. Most of the series is set in the real world so far, but there are a few sequences in familiar places. Dolores' plan seems simple, but since this is Westworld, the last half of the season will probably provide a few surprises, so keep your eyes wide open.

I can't really delve into what each character is doing, but according to the trailers, writing that Bernard and Maeve have an essential role in this season shouldn't come as a shock. Both possess two very intriguing arcs, and I'm definitely interested in knowing how they will connect to Dolores' storyline. Aaron Paul's Caleb doesn't have that much screentime in the first four episodes. Nevertheless, he receives a well-written backstory, and his subplot not only tells the audience everything about him, but it also shows how the real world works.

My biggest compliment to the first half of this season is about each episode's structure. Every single episode starts and ends with something impactful. Each time I started one, I was instantly captivated by what was happening, and every ending left me with an extreme curiosity to watch the next one. Fortunately, I had the ""next episode"" button, but it will definitely be interesting to see how fans will react to weeks of waiting for the next (great) episode. Throughout each chapter, the story flows naturally without those confusing, exaggerated, twistful narratives of season two.

So far, it's a pretty straightforward main plot, but the unsolved mysteries still carry that aura of unpredictability, which makes season three a perfect structure to deliver a phenomenal, shocking finale. The acting continues to be top-notch with everyone just giving their all. So far, my standouts are Tessa Thompson (Charlotte Hale) and Evan Rachel Wood. Ed Harris (William) also delivers an outstanding display, but the two women are unbelievably good, especially Thompson. Technically, the episodes were still a work in progress, but the production and visual quality of HBO are impressive as always.

All in all, Westworld returns with a perfect season's structure to blow every fan's mind away once again. The real world looks incredible, every character gets a very intriguing story, but the first and last few minutes of each episode are absolutely fantastic. Each chapter instantly grabs the viewer's attention, and the ending leaves everyone craving for the next episode. Tessa Thompson is the absolute standout, but Evan Rachel Wood continues to prove her impressive acting skills. Aaron Paul should have more screentime in the last half of the season, but so far, both he and Caleb are pretty great. Excellent pacing, brilliant tension-building regarding the central mystery, and wonderfully-written dialogues. Four episodes, nothing truly negative to point out. Hoping for a second-half as great or better than the first. | If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com

S1, was good, with a couple of shocking twists.
2, it got more interesting. 
S3, was also good, but some bits made no sense, and the main plot of this series kinda derailed from the original plot of the show itself. However, it did star Aaron Paul.

In any case, this show was really amazing; superb CGI, an ensemble cast (especially featuring Anthony Hopkins). And you see the characters evolve through the series.

It started off pretty great, I mean the first season I could really get into, but then the first season came out in 2016 and they were trying to make a compelling TV show.

Fastforward to season 2 and they got rid of all plot and characterization, and they started checking political boxes.  Does it fit nicely into left wing politics?  No, then change it so it does.

And then they made it more political and, honestly, that is when you lose people | Season one was very intriguing, if a little confusing. In season two everything just got way too gruesome. Season three kicks off a whole new level of cool. Of course, you end up rooting for the robots in the end. But all that nudity? Really?

If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com

Stranger Things first appeared in our lives back in 2016 with its phenomenal first season, followed by a less amazing yet still entertaining Season 2. I was pretty excited for the third adventure with one of the best (if not the best) young ensemble casts ever. The acting in this show is unbelievable, even more when considering the age of most of the kids (14-17). Millie Bobby Brown is 15-years-old! Fifteen! Weirdly, the show will only be eligible for next year's Emmy's, but if she doesn't get nominated AND win, I sincerely don't know what she needs to do more. The seamless ease that Millie has in showing emotion and delivering those subtle expressions that only the best actors can achieve after years of experience ... She's going to break the Oscar record for youngest Best Actress / Best Supporting Actress winner. It's meant to happen.

I started with her because last season I handed the highlight crown to Noah Schnapp (Will Byers) who also gives an excellent performance, even if his character has less to do this time around (similar to the debut season). Of all the young actors, Millie is so much ahead of her fellow colleagues that she indirectly diminishes Sadie Sink's (Max) performance. They have completely different emotional responses to similarly painful events. Not that Sadie isn't able to transmit her feelings (I enjoyed both her and her character a lot more this season), but jumping from Eleven showing 200% of her emotion to any other character is always going to feel that the other actor/actress isn't at her level (truthfully though, they aren't).

In addition to Millie, the other standout has to be David Harbour as Jim Hopper. This might be the funniest season so far, as well as the most emotionally powerful. Both are due to Hopper's arc and Harbour's award-worthy performance. He's hilarious, happy, sad, angry, drunk, frustrated, proud, ... His arc is definitely the one that serves as a pillar to this season's structure. Without him, this season wouldn't be near to the quality it is. Harbour's chemistry with Winona Ryder (Joyce Byers) is palpable, and that's basically enough for me to have a great time. However, The Duffer Brothers really deserve a lot of credit. The writing is some of the best I've seen in the last few years.

Everyone hated Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) in the first season, but his development got such a fantastic treatment that now everyone loves him. The same happens with Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery). I genuinely hated him last season due to how cliche and lazily written he was. Now, even though his backstory isn't anything innovative, he's undoubtedly seen as a more compelling character, which proves that Stranger Things really doesn't have a single bad character (main or supporting, at least). Max also gets a better script, plus her on-screen time with Eleven helped the character become more interesting. Nevertheless, how's the main gang?!

Well, Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson) spends less time with his original friends, but his side adventure with Steve, Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson), and Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke), the newest addition to the show which is also the best surprise of the season, is also pretty entertaining even if it's connected to one of my issues (more on that soon). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), Will, Eleven, and Max have a whole romantic subplot that I surprisingly enjoyed mostly due to how realistic and heartfelt The Duffer Brothers wrote it. Obviously, comedy is always a must inside this group, and I wasn't disappointed, having dropped more than just a few laughs throughout the episodes.

Finally, Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers) and Natalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler) also have their own inspiring journey, the one that addresses the most how people had to live in the 80s. Dealing with discrimination, workplace injustices, and different lifestyles are put in perspective always through unforced dialogue and/or events. I really loved this season structure. How each group of characters has their own side adventure so that in the end, they can all team-up together to defeat the evil within Hawkins. I never felt bored or less engaged in a story. Season 2 had that horrible episode with Kali (Linnea Berthelson), and some episodes seemed to drag. Season 3 not only has the perfect runtime for each episode, but the story that they cover during each chapter is always remarkably captivating.

Of course, I always felt more entertained when Eleven and Hopper were on-screen, so their subplots obviously became my favorites. However, they don't take anything away from the remaining stories or characters. Evidence number one would be the best ending of the show. It's hard to hold off the tears during those last few moments, especially if you went through the same event (which 99% of people definitely did unless you had literally zero friends growing up). Technically, the show proves that you don't need a big budget to provide visual delight. From the appropriated costume design to the addictive 80s' style soundtrack, everything is on-point with tons of practical effects being employed. The CGI regarding the monsters and everything that comes with them are convincing enough, and the action sequences are mostly shot well. The editing gets a little sloppy near the final episodes, but nothing too serious.

My main and only issue with this season has to be the actual main plot. The thread that connects all of the subplots and groups of characters that I've been praising so much. Besides being very similar to the last season (monster comes, possesses people, and you know the rest), it's worse regarding the ""how"" and ""why"" the monsters came back. There's a whole story involving Russians, secret bases and codes, that feel too cheesy and over-the-top, reaching a level of absurdity that even affected some action scenes ""a la Fast and Furious"". It's unusual for the main plot to be as cliche and uninteresting as it is, while the side stories are astonishingly good.

All in all, Stranger Things delivers yet another fantastic season. Its debut continues to hold the #1 spot, but Season 3 is so much better than its predecessor. Once again, the characters are what make this show a massive success. Even separating everyone into different groups, the cast's phenomenal chemistry remains intact. Millie Bobby Brown takes her crown back from Season 2's highlight, Noah Schnapp, and guarantees herself tons of nominations and hopefully a few awards, due to a perfect display of her emotional range. David Harbour is right behind her, and then comes the rest of the ensemble cast, one of the best to ever grace a TV screen. The Duffer Brothers are masterful screenwriters, presenting extremely developed character scripts, as well as funny, exciting and entertaining side stories. Despite a less strong main plot, Stranger Things finishes this season with the best ending of the entire series. If you're not crying during the last 10 minutes … I don't know. Can't wait for Season 4, even if I would be more than satisfied to see it end its run now.

Rating: A- | I came to the latest season of Stranger Things with real reservations. I felt the last season was simply a recycling of what had gone before and wondered, if this wasn't another case of, ""rinse and repeat.""

Well, thankfully, that's not the case. The latest season adds new material and fleshes out the overall back story. Its suitably creepy too, with yet more 80's style nostalgia and one of my favourite Kate Bush songs. 

Everything is well placed, great sets, great acting and thrills that keep you coming back. Its sets things up beautifully for the next season too.
 | I don't remember Africa being that popular in the 80s... do you?  I mean, those of you who are old enough to actually remember the 80s.  It was a hit, I remember that.  I remember my mom liked it... my MOTHER liked it, which is sort of the population that Toto catered to, but I don't remember Africa having that much play on any station that anyone openly listened to until... what 2014 when Family Guy popularized it again because one of their writers played too much GTA in the early naughts.

Anyway, this show comes with a really important lesson.

It was great, it really was, the first seasons were pretty fantastic, and then it stank.  It went woke, the character did things they wouldn't do, things that were completely out of character, all the men became incompetent morons, and then....

... and then it dropped the woke crap because it's fan base started to walk away and... the fan base came back, and the rest of the season was great again... well it was good again, it was better than just about everything else again.

If that changes past season one, well, I guess I might enjoy it more, but that's was my primary reason for giving the show a go, and my wife is enjoying this a lot more than I am.  Can't get enough of it. For me, it's pretty meh, and this is more of a warning for the guys than a proper review.

The show is 99% fish-out-of-water story of a feisty modern (well, from 1945 anyway) Englishwoman nurse , Claire Randall (played by Caitriona Balfe), who is sent back to 18th century Scotland by some mumbo-jumbo druidic magic after touching a runestone.  The theme is _heavy_ on a Harlequin-esque romance between the two leads, Claire and Jamie Fraser (played by Sam Heughan).  There's some fighting, almost as much boobies as Game of Thrones, and gore that may keep the guys interested, but this show is mostly going to appeal to women I think.

(This may be a spoiler, but there is also a FAR too long drawn-out guy-on-guy homoerotic torture arc that I really hated.  And, aside from the lead, a lot of the men depicted are pretty horrible.)

I think the historical costume-drama aspect of it is pretty interesting, I know a fair amount more about 18th century Scotland than I used to (which was pretty much nothing).  So, if you like that kind of stuff, you might like this.  Honestly though, I think having a POV of a modern woman kind of muddles the historical aspect a bit.  I liked Downton Abbey better if that helps (yes I know, different time period, but I think handled the period piece costume drama aspect better, even with all the soap opera tropes), so that may say something. | The 1st season was great... the 2nd season was okay... then it just gets silly.

**_SEASON 01:_**

Yeah, I'm from the walkman era. The cassettes, tape recorder, I've lived in the final days of that time enjoying all of them. I still have some old tapes saved somewhere that I've to locate them, but I've no device to place them. Anyway, when I heard about this series, how those previous technology was used to narrate a thriller drama, I was so happy. Each episode named after the how many tapes used, and its sides. Maybe the new generation won't understand that. Though the story matters, what it was focused and unfolding the truth, the message was great.

One of the top rated debut from the 2017. The Netflix usually strikes the gold, and so with this. After so many good reviews, I wanted to see it to learn what's that all about. In the end, I did not get disappointed. But it was not that great, except the message, a very important message in the present world. I thought they dragged it. The whole season. I think it should have been only half of those total episodes. So the plots would have got tighter and faster narration. That suicide scene really terrified me. It was too strong, definitely I'm against showing that to youngsters.

It was about a boy who receive a box of tapes from the dead girl. The girl who committed suicide, so she has recorded these tapes telling what made her to take this terrible decision. All those influenced in her life to her death gets the tape and finally how it all ends is the mystery told in the final episode. But before that, how the tale develops among the guys who are involved in it decides to stop this attempt. It's not that easily stopped and reasons are revealed.

Initially I thought it was one season thing, but now after the final episode, I think definitely season two is on. They have announced it as well now. Well acted and made with the production. Many actors you can point out, but Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford topped the list. There's more to come or I'm expected in the following season than what this season has revealed. So I think I'm going like that more than this. It's too early, but there's a very little it to get wrong. I hope that's where it ends, but they could be tempted to extend the series. Anyway, a nice watch. It will remain one of the best from the streaming giant! So watch it sooner than later!

_7.5/10_ | 13 Reasons Why does indeed make suicide seem glamorous. It's a dangerous message. Hannah Baker made a lot of bad choices throughout the series. She was attracted to dangerous, selfish boys, she dismissed the nice ones, and failed to help her friend as she was being violated just a few feet away in the same room. She drank herself silly, put importance in stupid, shallow things and then decided the best place to strip down to her bra and panties was in the hot tub of the very same boy who she just watched rape her friend. As she is taking it deep in her sniz from behind, is she really surprised? Of course, there is never an excuse to rape. However, a female must be aware of risky situations. If you are prone to getting black-out drunk or stoned or you commonly end up nude or semi-nude in rapists' hot tubs, your odds of being taken advantage of go up exponentially.

Season 2 is even more maddening than the 1st. Why? Because it goes out of its way to paint all females as natural born victims who are at the mercy of evil boys and men... ALL THE TIME.  Nothing is a girl's fault. Ever. As if that message isn't bad enough, Hannah gets to take a break from Heaven so she can return to Earth as a ghost and see how completely devastated people are without her. This will inevitably inspire real suicides of narcissistic dummies who feel the world revolves around them and their stupid romance problems. What many dolts don't realize is that when you are dead, YOU ARE DEAD. You don't get to watch everybody melt down because your awesome self is gone. It's over. FOREVER.

In conclusion, ultimately, NOBODY cares about who you are crushing on or who is manipulating your genitalia. Why not do your homework and take some time off from being an annoying idiot? Give it a try! Maybe you can contribute something positive to society rather than polluting the Universe with a bunch of melodramatic BS. | The rollercoaster that started with Hannah Baker and her titular motivations that drove her to suicide has finally come to a full stop. Everyone involved in the infamous tapes are damaged beyond repair, regardless what happinesses they find, and no one more than our protagonist Clay Jensen, whose conflict takes on the most phantasmagorical in the final ten episodes.

For a show that's gone on as long as **_13 Reasons Why_** (and, let's be real, it really didn't need to surpass one season), the melodrama keeps piling on. The first season is not without its faults but it's superior to everything that follows. Season 2 was one long, dragged out snoozer that hit no bumps until the finale, which brought us what is singlehandedly the most uncomfortable scene in the entire series (perhaps even Netflix overall). Yes, even more than the (now removed) bathtub suicide at the end of season 1.

While season 3 was a marked improvement over 2, ignoring the question of ""why the hell is this still on?"", at least new character Ani came in with something resembling a backstory, because that can't be said for any other new characters, although her use becomes extremely problematic (I'll give you a hint, it involves redeeming a rapist). A number of supporting players come into play in the second and third seasons, and then vanish with next to no explanation.

The writers room seem to have little idea how contemporary teenagers act, peppering every other word with an F bomb and their lives is one giant soap opera. This may be how some Gen Z'ers see their existence but **_13RW_** is next level. Bullying that leads to suicide is all too unfortunately common, yet has anyone (prior to the show's release) actually gone out of their way to record who they blame for the ultimate decision?

One thing I will credit the series as a whole is the committed performances of its young actors (_young_ is a strong word, considering the actor behind sociopathic school bully Montgomery is in his early thirties). With the material they're given, Katherine Langford (Hannah), Miles Heizer (Alex), Alisha Boe (Jessica), Brandon Flynn (Justin), Timothy Granaderos (Monty)--especially come season 4--really play out their strengths. But the most notable performance has to go to Devin Druid as the ambiguously disordered yearbook photographer Tyler.

Tyler's journey is, without a doubt, the most harrowing and heartbreaking arc, because he may as well be one of the realest depictions of a teenager--regardless of generation--on TV. He's a nice enough kid but he's singled out by everyone around him as weird and--in the case of the aforementioned tapes--seen as one of the worst subjects (his offense being a stalker), despite said tapes including a serial rapist, a pathological liar, a cowardly educator, a backstabbing friend and a slut-shamer.

The character development award goes to Brandon Flynn, who brings Justin Foley, a troubled boy from a broken and abusive home life, to life. The book that the series is based on doesn't go into that much detail but Flynn's downtrodden demeanor plays perfect to Justin's addiction storyline. He goes from gaslighting his girlfriend about being raped and solving problems with vague threats of violence to someone the audience really roots for, a protective and caring adopted brother to Clay. That is, until his life on the streets catches up to him and he's revealed to have contracted AIDS somewhere down the line. This is given a passing comment somewhere mid-season 4 and brought up in the extended length series finale.

Not sure who to pin that on, I guess the showrunners wanted to go out on something big. And nothing says big like offing a major and well-developed character (who's played by a gay man) with outdated representations of a controversially depicted disease in the final 90 minutes of your show.

Season 1: 86% | Season 2: 22% | Season 3: 42% | Season 4: 36% | Average: 46.5% | So, what we have here is a game of blame. A blame game that pushes the responsibility for a suicide from the individual to everyone else, almost saying that the decision to off oneself is made by others.

And then, as if to draw the biggest difference between Millennials and everyone else, it almost goes out of its way to say that people don't base their views on what everyone else thinks are wrong for being independently minded.

The message is clear, let others think for you unto your death. | **Short Summery: TV show started good, but turned into crap woke political show.**

**_Before you continue reading, be aware my review will contain spoilers._**

I watched first season and this is the conclusion I made from these series: Hannah Baker (girl who killed herself) was a drama queen who made a lot of mistakes, weren't very bright in her head and instead of making things right, she decided to end her own life and blame others. She was definitely a stupid girl. Who doesn't get bullied in school? I got bullied too when I was a kid. I'm pretty sure lots of you got bullied too, but it doesn't mean you need to kill yourself. You move on and concentrate on more important things like your future and study instead of those moron teenagers. From everything that I saw in a first season I saw crime only twice: Raping and sexual harrasment. Hannah saw how her classmate got raped by other classmate. She got harrased several times sexually by the same person and another person (Marcus, in a restaurant), yet instead of telling parents and going to Police station, she kept it quite. But what's most stupid thing she did was going at night to the rapist's house party & getting half naked in his hot tub which apparently she ended up being raped by him. Seriously, what did you expect? You know that, this guy is a rapist, yet you go to his house party at night, get in his hot tub half naked and end up with him alone in the tub? How dumb you must be to do that? But her stupidity doesn't end up there. After she gets raped by that guy, instead of finally going to Police station, again she keeps it as a secret and acts like nothing happens. Later she visits school council and tries to tell him about it, but she doesn't. She just gives him some puzzled answers when council is asking the right questions. Eventually he tells her that ""either you speak up about it and we will try to help, either you move on"", because if victim doesn't speak out about it, then no one can help them. It's the only way. And as always, Hannah fails here too and refuses to admit what happened and instead decides to kill herself and then records audio cassettes where she blames a lots of kids for her suicide, even good kids that didn't deserve it. For example, Ryan publishes her poem without her consent because he thinks whatever she wrote was beautiful (it's clear his intentions are good), yet Hannah gets upset and puts his name on the list of her bullies. Yeah, these kids are teenagers, they're not perfect, they will make mistakes, it's normal. All in all, I think Hannah was just a suicidal girl who would still kill herself soon or later in her life because she was too much sensitive snowflake + dumb and usually those two things don't mix well. If not this school, I'm pretty sure somewhere something else would still provoke her to end her life, maybe her coworker would say something mean or etc... Bottom line is that: Life's not perfect. Teenagers aren't perfect. Kids can be mean and bullies, but you move on and if you encounter any serious crime like rape, you go to Police station and speak about it! Things that Hannah didn't do. In general, she was a stupid girl who made lots of mistakes.

Second season is better. Not much to say about it, but it's more interesting.

Third season is already showing signs of propaganda. Jessica turns into some feminist crazy person. It's also dragging and slow and they put this new character Ani - African girl as a main character to narrate. Her character is so shallow, boring and uninteresting. She's horrible. Everything about her is annoying, her voice, her personality, her lies, EVERYTHING. She came out of left field, doesn't even fit with the original characters. And her stupid accent doesn't help either. She feels like creators of show just decided to take her and put her in this show because of her stupid accent. She feels like she doesn't belong in this show. God, she's so boring and annoying... Every time I hear her accent I want to turn off this show. Ending is also crap. Alex kills Bryce. Cold-hearted feminist Jessica doesn't help and they let Bryce drown and this stupid African guild covers them and blames on Monty.

Fourth season is worst of all seasons. It's a pure LGBT propaganda! I counted and 12 characters turns out gays! I think it's too much and not even realistic at all. This season is just a pure political agenda. Libtards are pushing it hard here, even making prom king and queen two king gay couples who everyone applaudes even their own parents. And Jessica character still being crappy feminist woke shit. It feels like that some libtard feminist LGBT American teenager wrote this garbage shit. It's a pure crap. I'm giving it 3/10, because story's not that bad, but this woke shit propaganda ruins the show. Lastly, thankfully, we don't have that annoying UK accent girl narrating the story.

Saddest thing is that US used to make best shows and movies in the past, like in 90's and early 2000, but all they make nowadays is a pure garbage propaganda. This country turned into some politically propaganda country with lowest quality for movies and shows. It's just sad.",True

This is partly because there are only two seasons, but mostly because I enjoy cyberpunk, sci-fi, the little details I pick up each time I watch, stories that tackle the human condition, and the overall idea behind the plot.

Even one of the theme songs is hopelessly romantic.

Recently started watching this show and for the first several episodes I was very intrigued. Kilgrave the super-villain (acted insanely well by Tennant), is compelling, and Jones at first is sympathetic, interesting, and supporting characters have promise.

Unfortunately by Episode 7 I had lost quite a bit of interest. After a while Jones - perpetually drunk, unwashed, sullen and angry - grates; she is very one-dimensional. Although what happened to her was terrible, other people have suffered at Kilgrave's hands, but no one takes it to the persistent pity-party levels Jones does, or does as good a job at alienating people. She's not coping, and snarls at anyone who tries to help her. She doesn't want people to get hurt because of her, but she is so emotionally crippled and wound so tightly by what happened it is difficult to trust her judgment and perspective, or sometimes even if she is sane. She can't see that every moment she lives her life in a broken way is a victory for Kilgrave. 

Episode 7 is a good example. After Kilgrave leaves her a terrible 'present', she hatches a wacky, unbelievable plot that she eventually convinces her friends to sort of go along with, against their better judgment. (Just the idea that a 'detective' would THINK you could get locked up immediately in SuperMax is absurd.) It's not even clear that she has really thought this through but her wild ranting and demand that everyone listen to her finally 'wins' people over. You get the feeling after a while any price is okay as long as she beats Kilgrave. Kilgrave is a bloody monster, but I'm not certain Jones wouldn't be okay with the entire world going to Hell if she could finally catch him. 

She's just too one dimensional. Her potential thoughtfulness and complexity is lost in a haze of booze, self-recrimination and self-pity. After a while she doesn't really engender sympathy but encourages eye rolls. 

I also haven't felt the connexion with Luke. Carnally maybe, but there is nothing that gives you a feel for them together, except for one scene at a food truck and protracted interactions in the bedroom. 

Ruben is a wasted character; I thought there would be more to him and his infatuation, but no. Malcolm and Simpson clearly have parts to play and I am still a bit curious what will happen but that is now really tempered. I was excited to see the next episode but I need time to recover after the mess that was 7.

It is not! Truly this would have been the end the show deserved had this been the final episode.

Apparently it was written as such until the show was renewed BUT with most of the cast moving on contractually already! Yes, a wrap around\ tag on scene\tale opens the show up to an all new reset of the beginning, only with a now adult Henry being approached by his unknown to him daughter (about the same age Henry was when he found Emma in ep 1 season 1)! She says he must go with her cause ""his family needs him"". Sound familiar? It would seem Henry, like Emma in that ep, is clueless and so another forgetting spell was cast. Or whatever!

For those who do not know, the next season will no longer have the following characters\actors: Emma Swan, Snow White, Prince Charming, Belle, young Henry, and I am sure I am forgetting one other. The core will be the now adult Henry, Hook, Gold, and the evil queen\not evil anymore.

How the show intends to carry on or explain where everyone missing has gone (yes there was a time jump in the tag on scene of several years) will be interesting to see, but I frankly have little hope for the continued success of the show. It was all about Emma, Snow, Charming, and how everything revolved around them. Without those characters I think it will be a rebooted show trying to be it's old self but simply unable to.

I mean everyone is together, happy, sitting down to a thanksgiving like meal in this ep's natural end! Somehow along the way all that is torn apart? Is the ultimate lesson learned to be that there are no happy endings or happy beginnings because even in a fantasy world life sucks? Crap happens to the best of people regardless of what they have overcome to get to a place of stability?

This should have been the end; a fitting finale. | This SHOULD have been Fables shouldn't it? Or at least it should have been more like Fables, it should have at least ripped the plot off that Bill Willingham gem a little more than it did.

But I think this was Disney related and Warner Brothers own the rights to all things DC. So legally I think they were forced to make something vastly different.

The thing is that it looked like they were going for a Fables story, and because of that some obvious plot threads kind of dropped off in the 1st season when it looked like they were getting too close to the comic for litigious safety

It's not Jessica Jones, but it's also the BEST cinematic version of the Punisher to date, including the 1989 Dolph Lundgren version which is arguably the best movie version to date.

Now, I've seen people on IMDb complain about the lack of super powers and the violence involved in the series and, well, clearly they aren't really familiar with the source material.

Especially since The Punisher is essentially Dexter. That is he's a serial killer tolerated only because he kills the bad guys. But still...serial killer.

And with that in mind, you have a series about a killer that kills a lot of killers worse than he is. Only unlike Dexter, he's killing them with guns and not really concerned about getting caught or the evidence he leaves behind.

He's just a killer. And, well, it works. It's done right. And the characters are perfect.

SEASON TWO:

Season 1 I gave 10 stars. Season 2 did something so anti-Punisher that I had to bring it down to 1.

It did the Jessica Jones thing. The first season was amazing, not Season 1 of Jessica Jones good, but it nailed The Punisher better than even some of the writers in the comics could ever dream of (MAX clearly excluded).

And then it does the political thing and unfortunately the politics were ""Woke.""

Now with Jessica Jones the kind of politics weren't that important...they still killed the show...but at least the politics fit the character.

Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Luke Cage (to an extent) you can introduce far left politics and it would fit their character. Daredevil is defined more by being a Catholic...but even then you can take the character to the left and it would fit (just not as far). They are all essentially liberal characters....but the Punisher is not a liberal character.

The Punisher can't go woke, Jessica can, but The Punisher is essentially a serial killing super conservative authoritarian. He's not a nice person.

The Punisher is slightly right of Atilla the Hun. He makes Trump look like a liberal. That is the essence of his character. He's an authoritarian.

He's a conservative character, that is his personality. He's more of a Neo-Con than Iron Man, he's more conservative than Mr. Fantastic..and Netflix made him woke.

It is a personality trait that brings him into conflict with so many other Marvel characters, especially very liberal characters like Captain America.

And I realize that woke people are also authoritarian...but it's an authoritarianism that is the direct opposite of The Punisher.

So, not only did they inject politics into my escapism again (which I hate) but this time the politics where in direct contrast to the character's personality.

So congratulations Netflix, you messed up a really good show on two levels.

Injecting politics into a show is irritating when you are watching it to escape the bleak reality on the news...but when the politics contrast the essence of the character it's a tragedy.",True

SEASON 01:

I neither read the book nor I knew the story. So this was a surprise mini-series. As far I've heard, this one was the finest adaptation. The best ever cast and the episodes were well split with each one had a great opening and the ending. The suspense kept me alive till the final episode, final scene. Meanwhile, I made some guesses, but most of them did not happen. In my opinion, it should have been a feature film duology. Then it would have been considered one of the best film series, as well as mystery film. And the Oscars, Golden Globes would have poured in. Now it got record 14 Emmy nods and I'm waiting for the result.

Well, it all started as a normal drama about the mothers whose children are in the same school, same class. The real story kick starts when a boy who recently moved into the town with his single mother was accused of bullying a classmate girl. So the mothers gang splits up on that issue, but it seems not much affecting the children, particularly those are involved in the it. As the story progresses and episodes to come, lots of mysteries revealed about those mothers and their personal life, as well as the recent past secrets. But how it all comes to end truck with a sudden and powerful twist.

All the big screen stars foraying into the small screen were the big advantage. That's why I said it should have been a big screen film. Each one had scope for their roles. It was well balanced characters, that makes hard to predict any one direction where the story could head. From the director of 'Dallas Buyers Club' and many awesome flicks. I hope it returns for the second season, which has a very slim chance. From the locations to the musics, I loved it. A perfect mystery-drama. Everyone should see this, even if those are not into the television series. I almost gave it out of out.

A terrifying story of human survival in an apocalyptic world. The show deals with love, loss, zombies (called 'walkers' on the show), death, destruction and zombies!
Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, Melissa McBride and Lauren Cohan are amongst the star studded cast who deliver **OUTSTANDING** performances in every episode. 

_The Walking Dead_ is consistently thrilling and emotionally resonant, with solid character development and enough blood-splattering gore to satisfy anyone! The comic book counterpart has a big influence on the show, so fans of the comic love it too.

Each season gives enough compelling character moments to reward longtime fans, while maintaining the back-breaking tension and suspense that keeps audiences watching again and again.

_The Walking Dead_ puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre, and each season demonstrates why it's one of the best horror shows on television. | The walking Dead is in once sense a metaphor for whats happened to this once great show. 

The originality of the first few seasons has gradually given way to a repetitiousness that tells me the show might still be shuffling along but its long since dead.

<br />Season rating: 8/10
<br />Overall show rating: 10/10

Still my favourite show, even ten seasons in.

This feels like a very long season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant a near twelve-month run from episode one to sixteen. That isn't the show's fault of course. Due to that, I had to refresh my mind as to what happened between E1/16 and a lot does occur in S10. I enjoyed all of it, I particularly love how gory the show is at times while the look of the walkers continues to impress with each episode. I like the S10 storyline, very intrigued to see how the final season goes.

Norman Reedus (Daryl), Danai Gurira (Michonne), Melissa McBride (Carol) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Negan) remain the pick of the show's cast, but you also have the likes of Samantha Morton (Alpha) and Ryan Hurst (Beta) in there too. Cailey Fleming (Judith) is still remarkable, she acts way beyond her young years. There are a few others who are good too.

I'm not saying it's the greatest show ever, but 'The Walking Dead' is my standout show personally. I love it. Bring on S11. | Paul Cantor has spoken well of this series. So at a moment I started binging on this series.

The first season was okay. Not so good, but far better than the crap losers tell people ”you have to watch the first five seasons till the action starts”. Watchable.

The second season got more interesting. One has to get past the unlimited ammo, and the unlimited gas available. After all these are the stupid kids who wanted to make momma proud: I got a college diploma, it's Creative Writing. The interaction was okay.

The third season and things are picking up. Never mind the breeding the specie mission. These are individuals. And they are cooperating to get past the greater obstacles, than they are out, each on their way. Nice.

Negan was annoying. He was over the top. And that was good. After all Negan is the Government: sadistic, ready to destroy anything that doesn't obey his whims, he has rules, and prisons, and reeducation, and justice.

And everything was okay, up to season 8. In season 8, the team slowly turns into a nationalistic bureaucracy. People have to sacrifice, not to save their dear ones, but ”for the tribe”. The good guys turn into monsters, and they are starting to lead politics: they ”civilize” the outsiders, or kill them all, just like Negan. All the characters become toxic: from trying to survive, they are now planning how to massacre ”them” before ”they” ”get” ”us”. Disgusting.

Season 8 was a let down. Season 9 was deplorable. Everybody had a little Negan inside, ready to get out and choke humanity out of any living being.

Season 10, well, I should not have watched it, but you know: National House Arrest. Everything becomes a regular sitcom: more and more characters are injected. They characters are diverse, because god willed it. The story becomes so dull, they have to splice many stories, and blend them together. So Team 1 is about to find out something, switch, Team 2 does something, but… switch, Team 3 is certain that something, switch, Team 1 found out the house is empty, they are planning their next move, when they hear a noise, switch, Team 2.

And now I am watching Season 11. Why? I have no idea. Maybe to say: I have watched it all. At least this is the last one, otherwise I would have waited for the next benevolent lockdown. Not only the boring stories are blended closer together, they are getting way beyond unlimited ammo: they get into a tunnel, to have some action, because they are not looking for anything in the tunnel. There is nobody behind. And in front there are bodies in bags. The zombies, after 12 years in bags, they are quite functional. And like the sensor in the fridge, one has to get close enough so they could start making the noise. And in the train there are zombies. And behind now it's full of zombies. And the missing characters pop up from the other direction? Where there are other zombies. What? Where? Or they raid a military base, Mission Impossible style. Why? Because. Period. Each time they waste bolts and arrows, but if they do the magical sleep, the game will replenish the stock after 8 hours of sleep. | I love this show so much I'm so addicted to what I can watch it read over and over and over and over again this is the best movie I've ever watched in my whole entire life I enjoyed every bit of it I hate to see how this show has to end I hope they still continue to keep going on I loved every character in this movie.",True

An HBO show with an all-star cast, created by the co-creator of the magnificent Lost. How could it all go wrong? And yet, it almost did. Season 1 at first glance was an inconsistent, tumultuous show of middling quality. Moments of genuine quality interspersed with plodding mediocrity. That said, upon a rewatch, my opinion of it significantly improved. It always was a good show, with some truly mesmerising moments (see Holy Wayne hugging Nora). Season 2 is where it really came alive, however. Whereas season 1 might have seemed overly gimmicky and lacking focus, season 2 delivered a truly engaging, engrossing story with the perfect mix of excitement, surreality and detailed characterisation. By season 3, critics were hailing it as one of the greatest shows of all time.

Season 3 introduced the typical Leftovers’ blend of humour, the bizarre (dogs taking over the world?), entertainment and gut-wrenching misery. Like the other magnificent, emotionally driven, character based show of recent times ‘Rectify’, this show could be considered ‘misery porn’. Though I love it! However, I do feel season 3 is something I will need to watch again. It had many moments of great quality, and it was excellent, but it felt almost a bit too chaotic and lacking focus at times. Moving on, whilst the show has a very strong cast, Justin Theroux is the real acting heavyweight. Indeed, the man is an acting God who should be a Hollywood A lister. Scott Glenn was spectacular in season 3 and Carrie Coon, plus Christopher Eccleston, were never anything short of magnificent. Eccleston’s episodes were always great and full of substance; whilst Coon excelled in the finale, signing off with great aplomb.

I have now watched this episode twice and both times I was struck by the exposition early on, where Nora reveals how she was allowed access to the chamber. For a show as adult and intellectual as this, it’s clumsy; however, it’s a minor gripe. The show soon made up for it with one of the first truly emotive scenes in an episode with a plethora of them. Matt and Nora said goodbye - joking at first - then Matt revealed his crisis of faith, and how petrified he was of perishing due to his cancer, leaving his son growing up without a father. It’s all very raw and visceral, and an incredible engagement resonates with the audience, to a level which very few shows have ever been capable of doing. Reminiscing about losing her kids, Nora steps into the chamber and says goodbye to her brother. There’s various flashbacks to old scenes in this episode, and it works as an homage to the show, much like the recent Trainspotting sequel did to the former (see the closing scene teasing the introduction of The Prodigy’s remix of Lust for life, before breaking into the credits, for an education in how to close a movie). It’s all constructed with tremendous finesse.

After getting into the chamber, time skips forward many years into the future, and an aged Nora is now living a new life in Australia. We’re given no explanation regarding what’s transpired since, and initially it’s unclear if she’s even in ‘our’ world. Kevin soon tracks her down, pretending he thinks they never had a relationship, and only briefly knew each other. The new Kevin seems softened, with restrained emotion. The audience is left unclear whether he’s telling the truth and everything is a bit ambiguous. It’s worth pointing out that this episode showcases the startling cinematography and stylistic techniques that illustrates this show’s quality. We see some truly beautiful shots of the Australian landscape and the production values are that of a big budget Hollywood movie.

Nora agrees to take Kevin up on an invitation to attend a ‘dance’, later revealed to be a wedding. Guests at this wedding are expected to wear beads. Nora rejects, and afterwards beads are placed around a goat’s neck, which proves significant later. The best scene of the entire show soon occurs, and one of the most powerful I have ever seen. The soulful, soothing elegance of ‘I’ve Got Dreams to Remember’, by Otis Redding starts playing and both characters proceed to dance. The music plays in harmony with the events construed and it all just blends to perfection in a scene dripping with sentiment. Kevin breaks down in tears of joy, but Nora tells him that this is fake and storms off, just as the crescendo really builds. The melancholic music plays out and Kevin is left standing as a broken man, drowning in misery. The Leftovers isn’t just a TV show, it’s a work of art.

Later on, Nora hears a goat whining in agony up a hill: the goat from the wedding has become tangled in a fence due to the beads. As the empowering, classical theme music builds, thunder roars, and Nora removes the tangled beads, placing them around her neck. She looks to the pitch black sky and the intense music culminates. Now accepting the beads, Nora is finally embracing her sins. The biblical references are obvious and the haunting imagery is incredibly powerful. The characters in The Leftovers are morally ambiguous and that is part of the show’s quality. Nora is capable of doing some quite reprehensible things and can be quite horrible to people. She is a highly flawed, but ultimately good person.

We soon see the real Kevin Garvey. He tracks down Nora again, breaks down and reveals he has spent all these years searching all over Australia for her. The emotion is overpowering. His excuse for his different recollection of events was he wanted to start afresh. The reasoning is a little flimsy, but it makes for an interesting story! The final scene soon plays out and whilst the wedding scene might be the créme de la créme of The Leftovers, this scene couldn’t be more emphatically emotive. The twist is revealed, though it’s of little consequence. This was a show focusing on dialogue and characterisation, with themes of tragedy, redemption and love permeating through it. Nora reveals that she did find her family, but they were happy, and so ultimately she travelled back. She desperately missed Kevin, but couldn’t tell him the truth. I know there’s some theories that Nora is lying, but I prefer to go with the events as they were explained. Kevin tells her he believes her, engulfed in tears, and the emotion displayed is incredible. Having spent a huge chunk of his life searching for her, he now has his woman again.

As the closing credits played out I sat in silence, awestruck by the magnificence I had just watched. While San Junipero was an excellent recent TV episode with similar themes, this obliterated it. The Leftovers was a show that had all manner of bizarre happenings - and a hugely talented ensemble cast - but the finale just focused on two characters and attempted nothing spectacular. And how it succeeded. The show ended on a rare happy note and it’s a real shame a show of this quality only lasted three seasons. Still, if people are happy to sit through 12 seasons of The Big Bang Theory, that’s their prerogative. Farewell to The Leftovers, one of the greatest shows of all time.

**Rating: 10/10**

*Black Sails* is a breathtaking journey into the Golden Age of Piracy, where legends come to life, and the thrills never cease. The creators have done a remarkable job weaving together the stories of various legendary pirates, creating a complex and authentic world filled with tension, betrayal, and intrigue. The show's unique atmosphere, excellent character development, and complex social-political layers make *Black Sails* one of the pinnacles of the genre.

**Story and Atmosphere:**

The story of *Black Sails* is set in the early 18th century in the Caribbean, where infamous pirates struggle for survival and riches. The series masterfully combines real historical figures with literary fiction, creating a unique and exciting narrative. The writers have done a brilliant job interlacing the different pirate legends, crafting a narrative that honors these tales while adding new and unexpected twists.

**Intrigue and Power Struggles:**

*Black Sails* excels at portraying the intrigue surrounding the pursuit of power and wealth. The characters will do anything to stay afloat, gain power, or maintain their positions. The series vividly demonstrates how different social classes view and handle political, commercial, and military situations. The show accurately depicts how knowledge, education, and experience could elevate a person during that time, especially if they were sharp-witted and observant—qualities embodied by characters like Captain Flint and Eleanor Guthrie.

**Characters and Development:**

One of the show's greatest strengths is its well-developed characters. Although most of the actors were relatively unknown, they excelled in their roles, and their character development is clearly visible as the story progresses.

**Captain James Flint (Toby Stephens):** Captain Flint is the central figure of the series, a complex and deeply layered character. Initially presented as a cold and calculating leader, Flint reveals more about his past traumas and motivations as the story unfolds. Toby Stephens' brilliant performance makes Flint a character both to admire and fear.

**John Silver (Luke Arnold):** John Silver is one of the show's biggest surprises. Initially appearing as a mere opportunist, he undergoes significant changes through his alliance with Flint and his own ambitions. Luke Arnold does an excellent job portraying Silver's evolution as he navigates the pirate world and gains increasing influence.

**Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New):** Eleanor, the leader of the trading operation on New Providence Island, is an incredibly intelligent and ambitious woman. Hannah New portrays Eleanor's tough and determined character, who can think strategically while ruthlessly managing her dealings with the pirates. Eleanor's character demonstrates how someone can be a successful leader even in the midst of chaos.

**Charles Vane (Zach McGowan):** Charles Vane is one of the most feared pirates in the series, rising to prominence through his raw strength and ruthless nature. Zach McGowan convincingly portrays this brutal yet dedicated leader with his own unique moral code.

**Jack Rackham (Toby Schmitz) and Anne Bonny (Clara Paget):** Jack and Anne are one of the most intriguing pairs in the series. Jack, the cunning and ambitious pirate always looking for the next big score, and Anne, his fierce and loyal partner, are both highly entertaining and deeply complex characters. Their relationship deepens as the series progresses, and they face the challenges of the pirate world together as true partners.

**Max (Jessica Parker Kennedy):** Max is one of the series' most resilient characters, who rises from working in a brothel to becoming one of the most influential women on the island. Her story excellently illustrates the sacrifices needed for survival and how to find the path to power.

**Social Strata and Political Intrigue:**

*Black Sails* masterfully depicts the contrasts between different social classes and their impact on political and commercial relations. The series shows how knowledge and education played crucial roles at the time and how these traits could quickly elevate someone in the social hierarchy. Those who played the game smartly and shrewdly—like Flint or Eleanor—often succeeded, while others fell victim to their own thirst for power.

**Conclusion:**

*Black Sails* is an exceptional series that brilliantly interweaves pirate legends into a complex and thrilling story. With its outstanding characters, masterful storytelling, and depiction of social and political intrigue, this show is a true gem. *Black Sails* is not just for fans of pirate tales but for anyone looking for a deep, thought-provoking, and exciting drama that excels in every aspect.",True

It was running on a treating service we had, so we started watching it. We liked it enough so that when our service suddenly stopped running The Good Wife we signed up for CBS All Access.

We have seen all seven seasons now and while I still liked it, the plots started to lag for me a bit in later seasons. Their professional relationships between different law firms or them personally kept changing, reminding me of the show Friends, where it felt like the main characters took turns dating each other.

Another element of the plots that struck me was the formula they seem sped to follow. They used a long running plot, usually political, that ran for entire seasons sometimes, and also had cases they handled that wrapped up in one show. Those cases often ran the same course: first one side would do well in court, then the other side would introduce something that helps them, and then the first side would — you get the idea. I called them reversals and got so I expected them every ten minutes or so for each show. Plus their investigators seemed really good at digging up dirt Fast. It isn’t a terrible thing. They only have 40+ minutes for each show and they want to cram drama in where they can. Perhaps I just noticed it more because I write novels and do a lot of plotting myself.

But we watched the entire seven seasons. I won’t be tempted to watch them again, but I don’t regret the time spent on them either. So now, before we give up CBS All Access, we need to try the sequel series, The Good Fig, and a show Alan Cumming is in that sounds good: Instinct.",True

Randy, Paula and Simon, iconic names on their own, but even more when you combine them together. Randy Jackson was a music mogul, an individual who played for Mariah Carey, and a legend in his own right. Paula Abdul music icon from the 80s, one of the biggest selling artist and amazing choreographers ever to step foot on a stage. And then Simon Cowell, the ruthless, aggressive and honest individual that America fell in love with. And has went on to become one of the Biggest Music executive directors in the world.

I’m going to captivate all seasons in this one review, so this is going to be a long one, so enjoy. 

Season one, what an incredible journey, a show that you did not think was going to last let alone become such a mega hit that it became. But more importantly, you had to have the right winner. With America voting did we get the right winner? America selected the quiet yet powerful vocals of Kelly Clarkson. Kelly Clarkson went on to solidify the show as a mega superpower. When she became a Grammy award-winning artist, television actress, movie actress, and she is now has a syndicated talk show. Kelly Clarkson went on to sell millions of albums, worldwide and even placed, second place in Idol against all the other idol competitions around the world.

Season two was the biggest controversial season we saw to date trying to follow up with the success of the first season, we awarded Ruben Studdard, the winner of American idol with a bunch of controversy, whether or not Clay Aiken should’ve been the one to go onto the show. Either way, both men came out of the successful and not only did the two men come out successful. Kimberly called well became in Household, hosting and becoming an actress.

Season three delivered Fantasia Barrino, one of the most underrated incredible voices in the world. Her voice is so unique and iconic. She went onto also become a Grammy award winner and best selling R&B artist. She also stemmed Jennifer Hudson and Oscar winning and Grammy winning artist as well from that season who plays seventh place. This showed American idol was not just focused on the winner, but the people from the top 12 also had an opportunity to become super successful. From the season alone we also got Deanna Degarmo who went to become a Broadway legend.. 

Season four, we got the greatest and legendary country singer in Carrie Underwood. She brought the fire and tore that season apart. She was a young lady who did not know anything and never had been on a plane. To go on and become a multi time, Grammy award winning artist and mega power, and now she sits at the table as one of the judges for American idol. 

Season five became the new controversy, after season two and season three brought us severe controversy season five hit us even harder. Taylor Hicks took home the title of American Idol during this season, and ended up failing as a credible winner. Not being able to hold up to the four before him. All four artists before him either are Grammy winners or Grammy nominated artist. Taylor could not live up to those expectations and standards. His fourth finisher Chris Daughtry went to be a Grammy award-winning rockstar. Which is the person everyone thought was going to win this show. Catherine McVie became an actress and Elliott Yamin pulled out a great singing career as well. we also got the Grammy award winning Christian artist Mandisa, and we got country artist of Bucky Covington and country superstar Kellie Pickler. Season five may have had the wrong winner, but it had the most incredible group of top 12. 

Season six, we got NFL football players, daughter Jordon Sparks as the winner youngest winner at that time. She went on to become also a Grammy nominated artist, keeping the trend alive that success can come from the show. We also got the boxing talents of Blake Lewis, and a few other individuals who stemmed from the show, but didn’t make it to the superstardom level.

Season seven we started to the show out with one of the most incredible finale battles. We’ve seen in a long time David versus David , two different individuals. One rocker and one gospel singer. The older David, David Cook came out on top as he prevailed the rocker of the season. He went on to sell multiple albums, but still never reached the stardom of five of his predecessors. He still had a very successful career, but it was never a megastar career.

During our season, eight journey, American idol decided to spice things up by adding a fourth judge. Kara Diaguardi and she brought a lot of controversy between Simon and herself. After seven years of being the three they are now the four. Kris Allen captured the title of season eight, with one of the most controversial wins of all time. Front runner and expected winner. Adam Lambert went on to become a star in his own right, but was believed to be the actual winner of the show. But America was not ready for an LGBT winner. Especially someone who was completely open about their sexuality. Now American Idol served a little differently than it normally did you may have got a few people to have minor success after the show. But by this time, if you weren’t the winner, you barely got any success afterwards and that didn’t even mean if you got success. Unfortunately, he may have won the competition but he did just as bad as the previous winner from season five.

We move onto season nine still with the same set of judges, Lee Dewyze wins the title in the most forgettable, unsuccessful, and unpopular season ever. America was not fond of the singer, songwriter, crooner season, that transpired from dispatch. The only thing we got from this was gospel singer Colton Dixon, which to be honest with you, he might’ve actually came from a different season, they also attempted to spice things up just a little more, by replacing longtime judge Paula Abdul with Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen did not work out, she hated everything about judging people, and quit the show immediately after.

Season 10, we return to a three judges panel. With Ellen DeGeneres quitting and American idol not renewing Kara‘s contract, and then Simon Cowell exiting the show. We were left up in the air with the judges panel. They brought on Steven Tyler from Aerosmith and Latin legend, Jennifer Lopez. This season saw the winner of Scotty McCreery, who went on to become a country superstar, but not only that he also was the first in a long time where the runner-up went on to be a country superstar in Lauren Alaina. America and American idol were back on top.

We moved into season 11 with the same judges Randy, Jennifer,Steven and what a group they turned out to be, funny and hilarious and great judges. We saw the coronation of Philip Phillips, who went on to have one of the greatest singles of all time. And even had it as the Olympics theme song for that year. Philip had struggled afterwards to captivate and connect with the audience. Which put him in the same boat as Taylor, David, Kris and Lee. But the American Idol team was helpful.

We moved on to season 12 this season saw the departure of Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez as judges. And brought in Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey. Unfortunately, for this season, Nikki and Mariah could not get along. The fighting, the continued arguments and bantering back-and-forth, took away from the contestants, and took away from their singing, and what the competition in the show was all about, and it turned into a dramatic all out mess. This season we got the winner of Candice Glover, who went on to do nothing, she became one of those forgotten winners, and one of the most failed American Idol winner of all time at this moment. She did release an album, but it failed on the charts. And it was because I believe the focus was off of these individuals and more on the dramatics of the judges. So nobody grew to love them like you did the previous winners.

So we went on to season 14 of American Idol. At this time, American Idol did not invite Nick or Mariah back, and Randy Jackson decided to part ways. The company brought back Jennifer Lopez to join Keith Urban and then brought on Harry Connick Junior, these three became the saving Grace of at least the judges panel. But it was too late for the show. The show kept these judges for the next three seasons. This season we saw the winner Caleb Johnson who took Candice‘s spot as the worst American Idol winner of all time. His failed rocker vibe and music did not captivate or grab anyone’s attention. His album flocked American idol continue to go.

Season 14, we got the winner of NickFradiani personally he is one of my favorite winners, because his music is incredible and underrated. But to the general public, he didn’t sell as bad as the other two but he’s definitely in the bottom five. He did continue to go on to perform in local venues and push forward the best he could. But now it was a stain on the American idol winners, and I believe it stems from that toxic judges panel.

We moved onto season 15, the end of American idol. They brought back the winners and some fan favorites, had a huge celebration for all the years the show was on there. The judges all came back and everybody celebrated. As the winner, Trent Harmon took on the final title of American idol. And even though, it is the end, it did not give him the push. He thought he was going to get. And he once again with the American idol winners became a failed champion.

American idol stayed gone for over a year, and the general public did miss the show, so Walt Disney purchases the show and brings it back with a more positive and energetic flare. They brought it back with the worst voting system, date. The judges had more power than America, so they got to choose majority of who they’re putting in, when America is the one that should be choosing because we are the ones that buy the albums. I said since day one, this was going to be a failure, if they do not change it back to single elimination instead of group elimination. But American idol decided it was going to do its own thing and push on.

Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan became the new judges of American Idol season 16 through 22

I’m gonna combine the seasons together for the most part, but I’m going to still give them their due and their credibility. Season 16 we saw the winner of Maddie Poppee who also was the wrong winner, because Gabby Barrett who worked third place in the show went on to be a country superstar and was the front runner the entire time. We finally got some thing from one of those shows, but it wasn’t the winner. Unfortunately, the winner went on to be a failed winner again.

Season 17 we saw Laine Hardy someone from previous season come back and capture the title. The Elvis look-alike young country megastar was going to be born, but American idol sat on his album debut, and sat on his music. To the point lane, then became a failed winner and gotten legal trouble, he’s making a return today as we speak. But it may be too late for the young country artist. 

Season 18 the pandemic season, the season that took place with everybody filming from their living room or their bedrooms. We watched as American idol still tried to keep this show relevant with everybody submitting their videos, the judges were on zoom, the contestants were on zoom and we continued to watch this show as just Sam, a young woman with financial issues captured the title. She had a beautiful voice and an incredible presence for someone who was never on the stage. Yet, American Idol dropped the ball with her completely, and she became the worst winner of all time. 
 
We moved onto season 19 when Chayce Beckham, captured the title, he went on to also be a failed winner and not successful in the world of music. He did have one song that slowly climb the charts, but never quite got anywhere. He was brought back many times on the show, but that was the only time you seen or heard of him. Yet, just Sam was still left off the show. And never took the stage.

Season 20 we got the winner of Noah Thompson, the wrong winner of American idol hands-down no questions asked. He captured the title of the show because he was extremely attractive. There was no way that America actually voted him in as the best singer, except they chose him based on his looks. And where did it get us another failed winner American idol is tarnished, I don’t see the show producing a mega star ever again. We have went through so much and yet we’ve gotten nowhere. 
 
But American idol continue to push forward with season 21, that’s when America finally saw firsthand. We claimed wrong winners in the past, but this was hands-down the wrong winner. Iam Tongi American idol’s first Hawaiian winner, went on to accomplish nothing. No music, no album and definitely no concerts. He was awarded the win on this show simply because of the passing of his parent, there is no way that this man beat half of the people that he was going up against. Unfortunately, the winners are final and they claim America’s vote. But this is the first time I questioned 100% whether or not, the show was rigged. They think they were going to get success from this person, no, they are not thinking, marketing wise, American idol went for a sympathetic run instead.

Season 22 another controversy strikes American Idol as Katy Perry the judge is called out for bullying a woman for having a baby and sex under age. Even though that is not what happened, we’re in a world of cancel culture. We’re in a world where people blow up social media and change things. So this will be the last season for Katie Perry as a judge. we went on to Crown the winner of Abi Carter, American idol, normally by this time has pushed their artist to be close to having an album, to get music out there and to captivate the world. But we have yet to see anything or hear anything from this young lady and it just looks like we’re gonna follow the same train of another failed winner.

Season 23 Carrie Underwood American idol. All they need is one mega star to come forward to reconnect the crowd and the audience and build up the history of these legendary winners from the past. Because we have not seen a single successful winner since season 10 and before season six. American Idol has more failed winners than they do champions.",True
american idol,Reality,The iconic series that revolutionized the television landscape by pioneering the music competition genre is back!,True,16.0,6.8,140.648,28,US,2018-03-11,True,Returning Series,7,131,124.0,"American idol, a season and series juggernaut, one of the most incredible and unique competitions to ever spark the world with the possibility of an unknown person becoming a mega star.

Randy, Paula and Simon, iconic names on their own, but even more when you combine them together. Randy Jackson was a music mogul, an individual who played for Mariah Carey, and a legend in his own right. Paula Abdul music icon from the 80s, one of the biggest selling artist and amazing choreographers ever to step foot on a stage. And then Simon Cowell, the ruthless, aggressive and honest individual that America fell in love with. And has went on to become one of the Biggest Music executive directors in the world.

I’m going to captivate all seasons in this one review, so this is going to be a long one, so enjoy. 

Season one, what an incredible journey, a show that you did not think was going to last let alone become such a mega hit that it became. But more importantly, you had to have the right winner. With America voting did we get the right winner? America selected the quiet yet powerful vocals of Kelly Clarkson. Kelly Clarkson went on to solidify the show as a mega superpower. When she became a Grammy award-winning artist, television actress, movie actress, and she is now has a syndicated talk show. Kelly Clarkson went on to sell millions of albums, worldwide and even placed, second place in Idol against all the other idol competitions around the world.

Season two was the biggest controversial season we saw to date trying to follow up with the success of the first season, we awarded Ruben Studdard, the winner of American idol with a bunch of controversy, whether or not Clay Aiken should’ve been the one to go onto the show. Either way, both men came out of the successful and not only did the two men come out successful. Kimberly called well became in Household, hosting and becoming an actress.

Season three delivered Fantasia Barrino, one of the most underrated incredible voices in the world. Her voice is so unique and iconic. She went onto also become a Grammy award winner and best selling R&B artist. She also stemmed Jennifer Hudson and Oscar winning and Grammy winning artist as well from that season who plays seventh place. This showed American idol was not just focused on the winner, but the people from the top 12 also had an opportunity to become super successful. From the season alone we also got Deanna Degarmo who went to become a Broadway legend.. 

Season four, we got the greatest and legendary country singer in Carrie Underwood. She brought the fire and tore that season apart. She was a young lady who did not know anything and never had been on a plane. To go on and become a multi time, Grammy award winning artist and mega power, and now she sits at the table as one of the judges for American idol. 

Season five became the new controversy, after season two and season three brought us severe controversy season five hit us even harder. Taylor Hicks took home the title of American Idol during this season, and ended up failing as a credible winner. Not being able to hold up to the four before him. All four artists before him either are Grammy winners or Grammy nominated artist. Taylor could not live up to those expectations and standards. His fourth finisher Chris Daughtry went to be a Grammy award-winning rockstar. Which is the person everyone thought was going to win this show. Catherine McVie became an actress and Elliott Yamin pulled out a great singing career as well. we also got the Grammy award winning Christian artist Mandisa, and we got country artist of Bucky Covington and country superstar Kellie Pickler. Season five may have had the wrong winner, but it had the most incredible group of top 12. 

Season six, we got NFL football players, daughter Jordon Sparks as the winner youngest winner at that time. She went on to become also a Grammy nominated artist, keeping the trend alive that success can come from the show. We also got the boxing talents of Blake Lewis, and a few other individuals who stemmed from the show, but didn’t make it to the superstardom level.

Season seven we started to the show out with one of the most incredible finale battles. We’ve seen in a long time David versus David , two different individuals. One rocker and one gospel singer. The older David, David Cook came out on top as he prevailed the rocker of the season. He went on to sell multiple albums, but still never reached the stardom of five of his predecessors. He still had a very successful career, but it was never a megastar career.

During our season, eight journey, American idol decided to spice things up by adding a fourth judge. Kara Diaguardi and she brought a lot of controversy between Simon and herself. After seven years of being the three they are now the four. Kris Allen captured the title of season eight, with one of the most controversial wins of all time. Front runner and expected winner. Adam Lambert went on to become a star in his own right, but was believed to be the actual winner of the show. But America was not ready for an LGBT winner. Especially someone who was completely open about their sexuality. Now American Idol served a little differently than it normally did you may have got a few people to have minor success after the show. But by this time, if you weren’t the winner, you barely got any success afterwards and that didn’t even mean if you got success. Unfortunately, he may have won the competition but he did just as bad as the previous winner from season five.

We move onto season nine still with the same set of judges, Lee Dewyze wins the title in the most forgettable, unsuccessful, and unpopular season ever. America was not fond of the singer, songwriter, crooner season, that transpired from dispatch. The only thing we got from this was gospel singer Colton Dixon, which to be honest with you, he might’ve actually came from a different season, they also attempted to spice things up just a little more, by replacing longtime judge Paula Abdul with Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen did not work out, she hated everything about judging people, and quit the show immediately after.

Season 10, we return to a three judges panel. With Ellen DeGeneres quitting and American idol not renewing Kara‘s contract, and then Simon Cowell exiting the show. We were left up in the air with the judges panel. They brought on Steven Tyler from Aerosmith and Latin legend, Jennifer Lopez. This season saw the winner of Scotty McCreery, who went on to become a country superstar, but not only that he also was the first in a long time where the runner-up went on to be a country superstar in Lauren Alaina. America and American idol were back on top.

We moved into season 11 with the same judges Randy, Jennifer,Steven and what a group they turned out to be, funny and hilarious and great judges. We saw the coronation of Philip Phillips, who went on to have one of the greatest singles of all time. And even had it as the Olympics theme song for that year. Philip had struggled afterwards to captivate and connect with the audience. Which put him in the same boat as Taylor, David, Kris and Lee. But the American Idol team was helpful.

We moved on to season 12 this season saw the departure of Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez as judges. And brought in Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey. Unfortunately, for this season, Nikki and Mariah could not get along. The fighting, the continued arguments and bantering back-and-forth, took away from the contestants, and took away from their singing, and what the competition in the show was all about, and it turned into a dramatic all out mess. This season we got the winner of Candice Glover, who went on to do nothing, she became one of those forgotten winners, and one of the most failed American Idol winner of all time at this moment. She did release an album, but it failed on the charts. And it was because I believe the focus was off of these individuals and more on the dramatics of the judges. So nobody grew to love them like you did the previous winners.

So we went on to season 14 of American Idol. At this time, American Idol did not invite Nick or Mariah back, and Randy Jackson decided to part ways. The company brought back Jennifer Lopez to join Keith Urban and then brought on Harry Connick Junior, these three became the saving Grace of at least the judges panel. But it was too late for the show. The show kept these judges for the next three seasons. This season we saw the winner Caleb Johnson who took Candice‘s spot as the worst American Idol winner of all time. His failed rocker vibe and music did not captivate or grab anyone’s attention. His album flocked American idol continue to go.

Season 14, we got the winner of NickFradiani personally he is one of my favorite winners, because his music is incredible and underrated. But to the general public, he didn’t sell as bad as the other two but he’s definitely in the bottom five. He did continue to go on to perform in local venues and push forward the best he could. But now it was a stain on the American idol winners, and I believe it stems from that toxic judges panel.

We moved onto season 15, the end of American idol. They brought back the winners and some fan favorites, had a huge celebration for all the years the show was on there. The judges all came back and everybody celebrated. As the winner, Trent Harmon took on the final title of American idol. And even though, it is the end, it did not give him the push. He thought he was going to get. And he once again with the American idol winners became a failed champion.

American idol stayed gone for over a year, and the general public did miss the show, so Walt Disney purchases the show and brings it back with a more positive and energetic flare. They brought it back with the worst voting system, date. The judges had more power than America, so they got to choose majority of who they’re putting in, when America is the one that should be choosing because we are the ones that buy the albums. I said since day one, this was going to be a failure, if they do not change it back to single elimination instead of group elimination. But American idol decided it was going to do its own thing and push on.

Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan became the new judges of American Idol season 16 through 22

I’m gonna combine the seasons together for the most part, but I’m going to still give them their due and their credibility. Season 16 we saw the winner of Maddie Poppee who also was the wrong winner, because Gabby Barrett who worked third place in the show went on to be a country superstar and was the front runner the entire time. We finally got some thing from one of those shows, but it wasn’t the winner. Unfortunately, the winner went on to be a failed winner again.

Season 17 we saw Laine Hardy someone from previous season come back and capture the title. The Elvis look-alike young country megastar was going to be born, but American idol sat on his album debut, and sat on his music. To the point lane, then became a failed winner and gotten legal trouble, he’s making a return today as we speak. But it may be too late for the young country artist. 

Season 18 the pandemic season, the season that took place with everybody filming from their living room or their bedrooms. We watched as American idol still tried to keep this show relevant with everybody submitting their videos, the judges were on zoom, the contestants were on zoom and we continued to watch this show as just Sam, a young woman with financial issues captured the title. She had a beautiful voice and an incredible presence for someone who was never on the stage. Yet, American Idol dropped the ball with her completely, and she became the worst winner of all time. 
 
We moved onto season 19 when Chayce Beckham, captured the title, he went on to also be a failed winner and not successful in the world of music. He did have one song that slowly climb the charts, but never quite got anywhere. He was brought back many times on the show, but that was the only time you seen or heard of him. Yet, just Sam was still left off the show. And never took the stage.

Season 20 we got the winner of Noah Thompson, the wrong winner of American idol hands-down no questions asked. He captured the title of the show because he was extremely attractive. There was no way that America actually voted him in as the best singer, except they chose him based on his looks. And where did it get us another failed winner American idol is tarnished, I don’t see the show producing a mega star ever again. We have went through so much and yet we’ve gotten nowhere. 
 
But American idol continue to push forward with season 21, that’s when America finally saw firsthand. We claimed wrong winners in the past, but this was hands-down the wrong winner. Iam Tongi American idol’s first Hawaiian winner, went on to accomplish nothing. No music, no album and definitely no concerts. He was awarded the win on this show simply because of the passing of his parent, there is no way that this man beat half of the people that he was going up against. Unfortunately, the winners are final and they claim America’s vote. But this is the first time I questioned 100% whether or not, the show was rigged. They think they were going to get success from this person, no, they are not thinking, marketing wise, American idol went for a sympathetic run instead.

Season 22 another controversy strikes American Idol as Katy Perry the judge is called out for bullying a woman for having a baby and sex under age. Even though that is not what happened, we’re in a world of cancel culture. We’re in a world where people blow up social media and change things. So this will be the last season for Katie Perry as a judge. we went on to Crown the winner of Abi Carter, American idol, normally by this time has pushed their artist to be close to having an album, to get music out there and to captivate the world. But we have yet to see anything or hear anything from this young lady and it just looks like we’re gonna follow the same train of another failed winner.

The only problem with Marvel's Agents of Shield is the reliance on the MCU, maybe that is why it became popular. But that is the main capping of the shows imagination and possibility. | A series to have a place for in your heart (27 September 2020)

It's not many series that age well. This did. My ratings for this series started around 6 or 7 and pushed their way through to almost perfect score. Is it objectively comparable to other 9's or 10's? I am not sure. Is it, subjectively? Hell yeah.

I finished the series thinking that I will miss them all. You love the characters and you stay engaged no matter what. They all grow, they all feel and they all live the part. In this final season more than the rest, it is crystal clear that they love the show as well. They have their fun with it and that's something really precious for any viewer.

The show touches upon almost if not all the ""big"" hot sci-fi and science subjects. And it does so gracefully. Does it not have cheesy or ""no-sense"" parts? Well yeah it has, how could it not? But who cares? You learn to love even these small drivels as in the grant scheme of the show, they are even funny.

The simple truth is that they rocked it on. Both the actors from the first pilot, to anyone else than joined in the later seasons. This is not a masterpiece series and it doesn't need to be. This is not a filming/acting/etc. crew. It's a family. And I am happy to have spent time with them all. To their ups and their downs.

Yes, this is a review of a fan so it maybe doesn't ring as objective. But this show got from winning my respect to winning my love, keeping my excitement topped along 7 bloody years, making it difficult for me to write an objective piece. I couldn't have wished for anything different.

If you, reading this, haven't watched the series yet: do, you are in for a hell of a ride. If you, reading this, were a part of the people working for this series: thank you. Your work will stay with me along the years and that's something you should be proud of.",True

There is a lot of tension and suspense involved. They have cases that go on for a moderator amount of time, but at least one that ranged for over a season. 

In some respects, Bosch is a typical police show detective. He is driven and stubborn, and pushes the line sometimes in what he does. He has an ex-wife, of course, but he doesn’t try to run her life or threaten her new love interests. Also, Bosch has a good relationship (mostly) with his daughter, and that is a good thing.

Still, the ruffians give him a rough way to go, because criminals really are stupid.

Most of prime time network TV is way too adult themed to feel good about letting her watch, and many of the kid shows are just too annoying for my tastes. Along comes iCarly, a show my daughter and I have watched from the beginning. The show is definitely aimed at kids, but there are enough funny moments (often provided by Spencer, played by Jerry Trainor) to keep me interested as well. All of the four main characters (Carly, Sam, Freddy and Spencer) are likable and have good chemistry. You get the feeling that they like each other off the set as well. As the first season is coming to an end, I can only hope they'll continue making more. I recommend this for any Dad (who has a sense of humor and still knows how to be a kid once in a while) to watch with his kid(s). | *A review of ""iCarly: Season One, Volume One,"" written in 2009.*  I will just state it at the outset. Although I am 40 years old, and ""iCarly,"" the hit Nickelodeon sitcom, is meant for my children, I honestly think it is the funniest comedy on television right now.

Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) is a junior high schooler in Seattle, living with her older twenty-something brother, pop artist Spencer (Jerry Trainor). Their father is in the military, stationed overseas, and the two live in a giant three story loft apartment with an elevator. Carly's best friend (and budding juvenile delinquent) is Sam (Jennette McCurdy) who lives with her as yet unseen mom. The two also pal around with Freddie (Nathan Kress), a technical whiz whose love for Carly is well known.

Carly, Sam, and Freddie webcast the internet show ""iCarly,"" and the Nickelodeon series follows their rising popularity, and dealings with everyday life at school and home. The DVD features thirteen episodes from the show's first season, plus some special features. I have listed each episode individually (they were all broadcast in 2007 and 2008), along with a capsule review, and my IMDB.com rating (1-10, with 10 being the best), and favorite line from the episode:

DISC ONE
iPilot (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Steve Hoefer)
Because this is the pilot episode, there is some pretty obvious plot exposition mixed into the story of how Carly, Sam, and Freddie decided to do a webcast. We also get to meet sympathetic school Principal Franklin (Tim Russ) and mean teacher Miss Briggs (a hysterical Mindy Sterling). Despite the newness and some awkwardness (Freddie luckily loses the shrillness after this episode), I laughed all the way through. 7/10.
Favorite line: ""Yeah, except he doesn't have Miss Briggs' crazy pointy boobs.""

iWant More Viewers (written by Steve Holland & Steve Molaro, directed by Adam Weissman)
Freddie and Spencer team up against Carly and Sam to see who can come up with the best idea to get more viewers. Hysterical from start to finish, especially the ""Messin' With Lewbert"" bit. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""Pee on Carl?""

iHatch Chicks (written by Steven Molaro, directed by David Kendall)
A science experiment goes wrong and Carly, Sam, Freddie, Spencer, and Freddie's science project partner Duke must find six baby chicks in the giant three story apartment. Consistently funny, with many memorable lines. My seven year old son's reaction upon seeing Miranda Cosgrove in a swimsuit? ""Carly's hot."" 9/10.
Favorite line (tough call): ""Wow, I've never seen dried beef make a boy so happy.""

iDream of Dance (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Adam Weissman)
The ""iCarly"" team decide to open their site to dance videos from their viewers, and are inundated with over three thousand. The trio slogs through a few hundred, fall asleep, and dream themselves into some nicely choreographed dance routines. The music is fun, the backup dancers are sensational, and Trainor's final dance sealed this as my favorite episode of the first season. 10/10.
Favorite lines (no way I could come up with just one): ""How dare you children boo a dancing Scotsman!,"" ""Because I move my legs in a fiery explosion of flailing limbs and floppy passion, wanna see it?,"" ""If he's a nub, then someday I want to be Mrs. Carly Nub,"" ""Get out of here, Gibby, this is my nightmare!,"" and ""Oh, Juiceboy's got a friend.""

iLike Jake (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Steve Hoefer)
When Jake, the hottest guy in school, breaks up with his girlfriend, Carly books him on the web show so he can sing, not realizing he is terrible. Strong plot and pacing, and nice work from Austin Butler as Jake. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""The internet can distort room size.""

iWanna Stay with Spencer (written by Arthur Gradstein, directed by Adam Weissman)
After Carly almost gets hurt by one of Spencer's nutty sculptures, their grandfather decides Carly needs to come live with him in nearby Yakima. Trainor really gets to shine here. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""What's her next phase? Stealing cars? Swimming with hobos?""

iNevel (written by Steve Holland, directed by Steve Hoefer)
My second favorite episode has Carly meeting Nevel, an eleven year old boy who gives ""iCarly"" a bad review on his hugely popular website after Carly rejects his advances. I don't know if he was eligible, but Reed Alexander is Emmy worthy as Nevel. 10/10.
Favorite line: ""Do you feel the rue? Ya feel it!""

DISC TWO
iScream on Halloween (written by Jake Farrow, directed by Steve Hoefer)
In this Halloween themed episode, Carly, Sam, and Freddie webcast from a haunted apartment in their building while Spencer tries to carve a giant pumpkin and keep trick or treaters at bay (he forgot to buy candy). A lesser episode in the ""iCarly"" canon, but still funny here and there. 6/10.
Favorite line: ""You gotta sick mama!""

iSpy a Mean Teacher (written by Steven Molaro, directed by Steve Hoefer)
Carly and Freddie decide to follow Miss Briggs around with a video camera to see what teachers do outside of school, and end up getting trapped in her apartment. Very, very funny stuff, with the entire cast doing well. 9/10.
Favorite lines (tie): ""My Aunt Maggie's boobs look more real than that, and they're ridiculous,"" and ""You dented my blow stick and punctured my squeeze bag!""

iWant to Date Freddie (written by Steve Holland, directed by Adam Weissman)
Freddie's new girlfriend Valerie wants to do a web show of her own, and tries to steal both Freddie and Sam from ""iCarly."" More fast moving than a network sitcom, with Freddie's first date and Valerie's web show the highlights. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""You won't get respect if your back's not erect.""

iWant a World Record (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Roger Christiansen)
Carly, Sam, and Freddie try to get into the Jonas Book of World Records by continuously streaming their webshow for over twenty-four hours. Typically surreal, and funny, episode with excellent supporting guest cast. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""I'm obsessed with the fattest priest. The chubby ones mean nothing to me.""

iRue the Day (written by Dan Schneider, directed by David Kendall)
Nevel returns to ruin ""iCarly"" just as they are getting the pop group Plain White T's on the webcast. Alexander as Nevel still cracks me up. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""You feel it, Carly? You feel the rue? Ya feel it?!""

iPromise Not to Tell (written by Dicky Murphy, directed by Steve Hoefer)
The final episode of this two disc set has Sam hacking into the school's computer and changing Carly and Freddie's grades. They then lie to family and school administration to cover for Sam. Chock full of funny lines, which make up for a couple of awkwardly played scenes. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""Hobos can't afford cable.""

EXTRAS

""Leave it All to Me"" Music Video
Cosgrove also sings the infectious theme song to the series, with a little help from former ""Drake & Josh"" co-star Drake Bell. The video is kind of meh, but the song will stay with you for days. 7/10.

Extended and Exclusive Making of the Video ""Leave it All to Me""
The ""iCarly"" cast also appears in the music video, and are pretty entertaining behind the scenes, too. 7/10.

Behind-the-Scenes Extras
These video bites are about ninety seconds long, and show the cast goofing off behind the scenes. All of them are naturally funny, although you won't learn any huge insight here. 7/10.

So, what can I say? I am a forty year old man who laughs at junior high antics. Although, the show's creator, Dan Schneider, is a comedic genius. He is about my age, and adds a touch of surrealism, some great running gags, and an excellent cast to Nickelodeon, making an even better show than his last hit- ""Drake & Josh."" My one complaint about the DVD collection is that a couple of the shows are out of order, which makes for some ""huh?"" moments when we meet new characters. I have been keeping up with Season 2, with ""iPie"" quite possibly the funniest sitcom episode in cable television history. I can find nothing bad about the cast, all of them shine, including guest and recurring characters like Freddie's mom (Mary Scheer) and evil doorman Lewbert. Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, and Jerry Trainor have such a great chemistry onscreen, it's creepy.

Sure, you might watch this and not find it that hilarious, and that's okay. I am completely immature. You can have your ""Two and a Half Men"" (which is only funny when that kid is on) or your ""How I Met Your Mother"" (which is only funny when Doogie Howser is on), I will take my ""iCarly: Season 1, Volume 1"" DVD set with its running jokes (Schneider's name appearing here and there, hobo jokes, the word 'nub') and giggle alone, waiting anxiously for Season 1, Volume 2 to come out in a little while. I told everyone at work I bought this set for my kids, and that is partially true, but I think I enjoy it more.",True

The only thing I don't like in Nikita is, that they used the same actors and actresses for different roles throughout the show. Percy's agent who tranquilized the reporter in the 3th episode was also given the role as a bodyguard of Mr. Zoman. He was given so many other roles as well. The bold agent of Percy who lost his key card to Alex in S1, E11 was also given countless of roles. Liza's mother also played as a different character in 2 episodes at least.

To achieve this it has to be original so you don't think the scripts have been written by a computer programming that cuts and pastes the ""best"" bits out of other series or just rehashes something that's already been done but long enough ago that the key audience won't have seen the original. So it's original by creating a lead character that's a serial killer but he has to be a hero as well or it's going to be a villain in a slasher series. So he's given the **code** which only allows him to kill the really bad guys. He's very intelligent but how's he going to get the information he needs so he can be sure he's targeting a real bad guy who deserves what's coming to him or her? So even though he smart enough to become a top doctor he chooses to become a forensic scientist and work for the police.

Well, sadly, this doesn't really deliver at all. Henry VII - the first Tudor king of England - who reigned for almost a quarter of a century doesn't feature at all; therefore we are deprived of any backstory to the real focus character of these 38 episodes. Henry VIII had a reputation as a brute, a violent headstrong man with a penchant for women, power and coupled with his arguably even more ambitious Chancellor Wolsey we ought to have had a belter of a drama with just about nothing off limits! Nope, no chance - we have in the two lead characters the Tudor equivalent of ""Peter Pan"" and ""Wendy"". Jonathan Rhys Meyers is dreadful, and Sam Neill has all the menace of a wet sponge as the scheming Cardinal with designs on the Papacy. Regrettably, these lacklustre opening episodes sets the tone for the remainder of this really lacking drama. The storylines give the faintest of nods to this lively period of English history, but even the Anne Boleyn (the frankly awful Natalie Dormer) scenarios - which are the stuff of novels and dissertations the world over become little more than a fancy dress farce. We rarely see anything of substance emerge - the establishment of the Church of Engand is but a scant moment amongst the pantomime this has quickly become. Henry Cavill provides some eye candy as his best mate ""Suffolk""; Kris Holden Reid as the sexually ambitious ""Compton"" (he of the famous Soho London St, presumably?) - hell, even Peter O'Toole gets in on the act picking up Sir John Gielgud's mantle as the go-to actor for the role of a Pope (Paul III). None of the wives, including the aforementioned Dormer, exude anything by way of chemistry or personality, with Joss Stone far too attractive to be the convincing turn off ""Anne of Cleves"" depicted here. To be fair, a great deal of attention has been paid to the look of the series. The costumes are top drawer and the CGI complimentary rather than intrusive. That said, the whole thing is an hugely disappointing exercise in big budget drama with little focus on the quality of the writing. The casting assumes we would rather have pretty things to look at than actors who could immerse us in this exciting and turbulent period of history - and aside from Ray Winstone's terrible effort with the same character (from 2003) this is easily the worst portrayal of Henry VIII I have ever witnessed.

He has money, toys, and rotating women, but he’s bored. So bored in fact that he has killed off his best-selling character, Derrick Storm, a rogue prone to danger. Castle’s looking for something new.

Enter Kate Beckett, a strong forceful female homicide detective. The fact that she’s also hot is irrelevant to her, but not to Castle. A serial killer is committing murders and staging them to look like kills from Castle’s books, so Beckett needs to interview him. He’s all play, she’s all business. She doesn’t think that he’s likely involved, but she has to interview him anyway.

Castle is hooked. He convinces the mayor to “let” him work the case as a consultant/advisor, much to Beckett’s dismay, and the game is afoot. Castle helps solve the case, and the successful partnership continues so Castle can do research.

As the opening narration reveals, every writer has his muse, and Castle thinks he’s found his. He even bases a new character on her — Nikki Heat. A strong forceful female homicide detective who works with a roguish mystery writer to solve cases. With a small difference — in his books, the two are lovers, which Castle wants to replicate with Beckett. But like I said, she’s all business.

Season 1: Beckett brings the serious, Castle makes it fun. 4/5

Season 2: Season 2 starts with Beckett and Castle on the outs, as she’s pissed at him for looking into her mother’s case at the end of season 1. By the end of the season, Castle is starting to give up the romantic chase, just as Beckett starts to think she likes the chase. 3/5

Season 3: This is the season where Castle hits its stride. Beckett and Castle are in a good place after the first couple of episodes, they’re in their groove, and they’re even making progress on the conspiracy that claimed Beckett’s mother. 4/5

Season 4: Building off Season 3, this season really starts to gel in certain areas. Which is odd, because the characters are written so they are NOT gelling…Castle finished off Season 3 with a big pronouncement, and Beckett says she doesn’t remember it. So they are at odds for most of the season. They have their moments, and then they have stumbling blocks. While a lot of Seasons 1-3 were about Castle growing up a little, finding something to care about besides being a playboy writer, this season is about Beckett growing as a person, finding something to care about other than her job. 4/5

Season 5: I really want to love this season, and there are some seriously good episodes, like Ryan going undercover or the Rear Window episode. And while the average is higher for individual EPs, driving the season up to 4.0 overall, my overall satisfaction was down — the backstory just wasn’t working for me any more around Bracken, 3XK, Beckett’s mom, and the wildside of Castle’s Dad’s story (great premise, not awesomely executed). 4/5

Season 6: The season starts off with Beckett working in Washington, and the whole dynamic just doesn’t work. I like the 3XK stuff, and a Carrie-like prank. I’ll even accept the wedding episode. But not a great season overall, one of the lower average scores so far. 3/5

Season 7: As I watched the episodes, I frequently felt, “Okay, last season”. Quite a few Eps seem like repeats of story ideas they’ve used before or promising ones that go nowhere. I was initially skeptical of the “Castle as P.I.” plot device, but it isn’t completely batty in its execution, and it does work for the most part. Washington? Not so much. 3/5

Season 8: There is an episode near the end (E19) that is one of the best of the series…it is funny, it is interesting, it is vintage Season 1 and 4 all together in a big bowl of mystery with comedy sprinkled on top. A complete palate cleanser from all the Eps filled with Angst. Yet by the time I got there, the first half of the season was almost making me wonder if I would continue watching.

If you like Terminator movies, battlestar Galatia/Caprica then this will be a treat.

I saw bits on TV but never could get the story, that's due to the story arc, you have to watch every episode (except 1). There are slow bits but worth watching for the high bits.

S1 is good story character building, each character has back stories or future stories.

S2 really hits the high mark except for 1crap episode.

S3 never happened just when the show found the Awe-factor.

My only con is due to the fact that it is called Sarah Connor Chronicles, some episodes seems like they wrote her into the story just due to the title. Over 60secs of SC talking was a drag especially when JC started to become the stronger character, some parts seemed to be written to try to make SC relevant, towards the end of S2 that didn't fit the story line. Thats why maybe the title worked against the show and should of been more generic like Terminator: the pre-Judgement-Chronicles.

-Tom | Yeah, I am still bitter that they canceled this.  I mean BITTER, I really got into this.  it was entertaining and it felt like it was only just taking off and CANCELED!!!!  That breaks this heart, I wanted at least 4 seasons and a movie.

But, I guess the good things never last. I am going to blame marketing for this, given that I remember hearing about them making a series...and then I didn't even realize what channel it was on until almost the end of the second and final season. So that could be why, but who knows.

The good news is that Sarah Connor completely and totally disavows T3. The story starts with T2 ending the movie canon and believe me we are all greatful for that.

The fact is that Lena Headey pulls off tough really well in this, almost better than...I feel so dirty saying this...but almost better than Linda Hamilton. At least, I liked Headey more in the role. She seemed to balance the mother and the soldier a lot better than Hamilton did--though she had scarce opportunity to do it in the movies.

Summer Glau is the new good Terminator and, for those of you that haven't seen it, she is threatening in this. She is small and thin and really very ominous in her role and given her size, being as believably threatening as she was is just pure talent. There is no way someone with her figure could pull that off without really knowing how to act.

And the cool thing about this is that John Connor--Thomas Dekker--isn't the savior of humanity yet and that was a big draw because even though the movie focuses on his mother, had the series lasted longer we could have seen how he developed into the man that saves humanity form the machines and I really would have loved to see that.

Alas all we have are two awesome seasons and a lot of angry fans and even though it is incomplete, it is something that is worth watching, it's fantastically entertaining and everyone does a great job.

Years ago I watched ""The Corner"", which was like a prequel to The Wire, and it not only saddened me as to how people live and are dependent on drugs, but it also intrigued me. So much so that I went on to watch The Wire.

What I loved about the show is how it views the misery of drugs from different perspectives. In season 1 it focuses on the on-going battle between the street-corner dealers and the police; season 2 focuses on drug distribution; season 3 the possibility of a drug amnesty; season 4 and school kids and their choices between education, employment and drug dealers; season 5 the media take on drugs.

There is a certain feeling of helplessness running through this show, as you quickly realise that despite the extreme law enforcement the war on drugs is long gone.

""New Amsterdam"" provides a rich and engaging platform for this exploration, offering a glimpse into the intricate workings of society without the real-life pressures.

The series also serves as a fascinating case study in leadership. Max, the hospital director, embodies a cool, honest, and effective leadership style that I find particularly compelling.

It was about two brothers, their iconic Chevy Impala, and the kind of storytelling that digs deep, pulls at your heart, and keeps you hooked until the very end.

At its core, *Supernatural* was a masterclass in blending horror, humor, and raw emotion. It’s no surprise the *SPN Family*remains as passionate as ever—because this show wasn’t just something you watched, it was something you *felt*. Whether the Winchester brothers were fighting demons or angels, it was always about their bond. That’s the heartbeat of *Supernatural*.

So what made *Supernatural* stand out? From the unforgettable chemistry between Sam and Dean to the perfect mix of epic mythology and iconic episodes, *Supernatural* earned its place as one of TV’s greatest—and even after 15 seasons, we still can’t stop talking about it.

## **Sam and Dean: The Unbreakable Bond at Supernatural’s Core**

At the center of *Supernatural* is one undeniable truth: this show is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean Winchester. Sure, they’ve battled everything from shape-shifters to archangels, but the real fight has always been for each other. Their bond goes beyond just being brothers—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and that deep, unspoken connection that keeps them pushing forward no matter the cost.

Sam and Dean aren’t just characters—they’ve become a blueprint for what makes a dynamic duo truly great. Dean, with his tough-as-nails exterior and unshakeable devotion, and Sam, the thoughtful, conflicted younger brother trying to balance family duty with his own desires, are the emotional heartbeat of the series. Together, they aren’t just fighting monsters—they’re fighting fate, destiny, and everything in between.

What makes their relationship so powerful is the constant tug-of-war between their deep love for one another and the weight of the sacrifices they make. Each of them has literally gone to Hell and back for the other, and these moments of sacrifice hit hard because they feel real. It’s the kind of relationship that sticks with you long after the credits roll. No matter how intense the monster hunts get, it’s always the quieter, more intimate moments between Sam and Dean that resonate the most.

The Winchester brothers are the reason we keep coming back. Their chemistry is electric, their struggles are relatable, and their bond is unbreakable. At the end of the day, *Supernatural* isn’t just about saving the world—it’s about saving each other, and that’s what makes it special.

## **A Perfect Blend: Horror, Comedy, Drama, and Heart**

*Supernatural* is a masterclass in genre-blending. This show doesn’t just play in one sandbox—it takes over the entire playground. Horror? Check. Comedy? Absolutely. Drama? You bet. And somehow, it manages to weave all of these elements together without missing a beat.

Let’s start with the horror. We’re talking everything from classic ghost hunts to full-on battles with demons and angels. The scares are real, but *Supernatural* never leans too hard into the gloom. Just when you’re clutching your blanket, Dean drops a snarky one-liner or Castiel gives you that wonderfully deadpan confusion, and suddenly you’re laughing. It’s this perfect pivot between tension and humor that keeps the show fresh and—dare I say it—fun.

But here’s where *Supernatural* really nails it: the heart. Beneath all the monster slaying and apocalyptic drama, this is a show about family and sacrifice. Every episode, no matter how wild the plot gets, is anchored by Sam and Dean’s relationship. They’ll literally go to Hell (and back) for each other, and the emotional depth that brings is what turns a good show into a great one.

The genius of *Supernatural* is that it never lets one genre overpower the others. It’s as comfortable delivering gut-punching emotional moments as it is making you jump out of your seat or burst out laughing. And that balance? That’s why fans keep coming back—because with *Supernatural*, you’re getting the best of every world.

## **The *Supernatural* Mythology: From Urban Legends to Apocalyptic Battles**

If you thought *Supernatural* was just about hunting ghosts and taking down demons, think again. This show goes all-in when it comes to mythology—pulling from urban legends, religious lore, and just about every spooky story you’ve ever heard whispered around a campfire. It’s like a folklore buffet, and *Supernatural* serves it up hot.

The early seasons keep it tight with classic monster-of-the-week vibes: wendigos, shapeshifters, cursed mirrors—you name it, Sam and Dean have faced it. But here’s where the show really flexes its creative muscles. As it grows, so does the mythology, until we’re no longer just talking about salt lines and silver bullets. Suddenly, we’re dealing with fallen angels, biblical prophecies, and—oh yeah—Lucifer himself. This isn’t your average horror show; this is epic, universe-spanning storytelling.

*Supernatural* does what few other shows manage—it constantly raises the stakes without collapsing under the weight of its own lore. It takes bold swings. One season, you’re dealing with a local haunting, the next, you’re questioning the very nature of free will and destiny as Sam and Dean go toe-to-toe with God. Yeah, it gets that big. But no matter how grand the mythology gets, the story never forgets where it started—on the road, in that Impala, with two brothers just trying to survive.

The genius lies in the balance. The show dances between grounded urban legends and sweeping, cosmic battles, and somehow, it all works. The lore isn’t just background noise either—it’s integral to the emotional weight of the series. Every demon exorcised, every angelic encounter adds layers to Sam and Dean’s journey, and by the end, you’re not just watching a TV show—you’re knee-deep in a modern myth.

## **Character Growth and Evolution: From Hunters to Heroes**

Let’s get one thing straight—*Supernatural* wouldn’t be the powerhouse it is without its incredible character work. Sure, the monsters, demons, and angels are fun, but it’s the characters that keep us coming back. Over 15 seasons, these aren’t just hunters—they’re heroes, villains, and everything in between, evolving in ways that make them feel real and raw.

We’ve got Sam and Dean, obviously, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. *Supernatural* thrives because it fills its world with characters who are as complex as they are iconic, whether they’re wielding a blade, throwing a sarcastic quip, or breaking your heart in ways you didn’t see coming.

### **The Winchester Brothers: Heart of the Show**

Let’s start where it all began: Sam and Dean. These two aren’t just brothers—they’re the emotional core of the entire series. From episode one, it’s clear their bond is what makes this show different. Sure, they fight demons and battle the apocalypse on a regular basis, but at the end of the day, *Supernatural* is a story about family.

Dean, the hardened, tough-love protector, grows from a cocky hunter into a deeply vulnerable character, grappling with self-worth and purpose. His bravado might be the surface, but underneath is a man who’d throw himself into Hell (literally) for the people he loves. Dean is a walking paradox: a man who craves love but feels he doesn’t deserve it. By the end, his arc feels like an emotional marathon—you’ve seen him win, lose, and keep fighting even when all hope is gone.

And then there’s Sam. The younger Winchester brother starts out wanting nothing to do with the hunter life, but as the series progresses, we watch him become the moral compass, even when that means making brutal sacrifices. He wrestles with dark powers, addiction, and self-doubt, but somehow, Sam always finds his way back to the fight. His journey from idealistic college kid to seasoned hero with a complicated past makes him one of the most dynamic characters on TV.

### **Bobby Singer: The Reluctant Mentor Turned Father Figure**

Bobby Singer didn’t just help Sam and Dean fight monsters—he taught them how to survive in a world where evil was as constant as the rising sun. From the moment Bobby entered their lives, he wasn’t just another hunter in the background; he became the mentor they needed after losing their father. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural and his no-nonsense approach to hunting, Bobby became the man the brothers could turn to when things got rough, a guiding voice when John Winchester’s strict code of survival wasn’t enough.

What made Bobby stand out was that he wasn’t a stereotypical mentor. He was gruff, stubborn, and unapologetically real. But beneath that tough exterior, Bobby had a heart of gold—and a deep, almost paternal love for Sam and Dean. He didn’t just teach them how to fight; he taught them how to think. Bobby wasn’t afraid to call the boys out on their mistakes, pushing them to be better hunters, better brothers, and better men.

And let’s not forget his intellectual prowess. Bobby was the go-to source for lore, rituals, and all things supernatural. When Sam and Dean were stumped, Bobby had the answers, usually found buried in one of his many old, dusty books. His combination of intellect and heart made him indispensable to the Winchester’s journey.

More than anything, Bobby’s presence grounded Sam and Dean. He was their anchor, the one person who wasn’t afraid to show them tough love while also being the emotional support they so desperately needed. He wasn’t just a hunter or a friend—he was family, shaping the brothers into the heroes they would ultimately become

### **Castiel: The Angel Who Fell (In More Ways Than One)**

Now, let’s talk about *Castiel*, the angel who became so much more than just a celestial being. Castiel starts out as a soldier of Heaven, but his journey quickly takes him down a more human path. He learns about loyalty, sacrifice, and love—not from the angels above, but from Sam and Dean.

Castiel’s evolution is one of the most emotionally satisfying parts of the series. His deadpan humor and awkward attempts to understand human behavior give the show some of its best comedic moments, but it’s his growing humanity that really tugs at the heartstrings. He transforms from a rigid, obedient angel to a fiercely loyal friend, even when it means defying Heaven’s orders. By the end, Castiel isn’t just an angel—he’s family. His ultimate sacrifice, fueled by love, is one of the show’s most heartbreaking and powerful moments, cementing his place as a fan favorite.

### **Crowley: The Demon with a Heart (Maybe)**

Now, enter *Crowley*, the self-proclaimed “King of Hell” who somehow becomes one of the most beloved characters in the show. Crowley isn’t your typical villain—he’s equal parts sinister and hilarious, wielding sarcasm like a weapon. He dances in the grey area between good and evil, forming uneasy alliances with Sam and Dean that blur the lines of morality. Crowley’s evolution is wild: from ruthless demon to someone who shows flashes of loyalty and, dare I say, compassion. He’s the bad guy you hate to love, but can’t stop rooting for. The man makes deals with souls, but still manages to feel like a necessary part of the Winchester family.

### **Lucifer: The Devil in the Details**

And speaking of villains—let’s not forget *Lucifer*. You’d expect the Devil to be all fire and brimstone, but *Supernatural*gives us a version of him that’s sharp-tongued, manipulative, and, oddly enough, a little charismatic. He’s the ultimate Big Bad, but Lucifer’s complexity goes deeper than just being evil incarnate. He’s a character who feels betrayed, cast aside by his own father (God), and, as twisted as it sounds, you almost *get* him. Almost. Lucifer is unpredictable in the best way—one minute, he’s terrifying, and the next, he’s delivering one of the funniest lines in the show. That’s the beauty of *Supernatural*—even the most sinister characters have layers.

### **Rowena: Witch with Ambition**

Let’s talk about *Rowena*. If you thought Crowley was complicated, his mother takes it to another level. Rowena starts out as a cunning, ruthless witch who’s only out for herself. But over time, she evolves into something much more intriguing—a fiercely independent character who eventually shows depth beyond her manipulative facade. Rowena’s growth from power-hungry villain to someone capable of sacrifice gives us one of the richest character arcs in the series. Plus, her sharp tongue and witty one-liners make every scene she’s in a delight. Rowena is the kind of character who proves that even the baddest of witches can change—if only on her own terms.

### **Charlie Bradbury: The Nerdy Hero We Needed**

Charlie Bradbury was the fandom’s heart, the geek girl who jumped into the Winchester world and held her own. A brilliant hacker turned hunter, she brought an infectious energy to the series. Charlie was quirky, brave, and endlessly resourceful. Her relationship with Sam and Dean evolved into something like family—proving that not all bonds in *Supernatural* are forged in blood. Charlie represented the fan in all of us, geeking out over LARPing one minute and slaying monsters the next. Her tragic end hit hard because we saw so much of ourselves in her—a reminder that in *Supernatural*, no one is safe, not even the ones who make us smile the most

*Supernatural*’s genius lies in its characters—each one layered, each one evolving in unexpected ways. Whether it’s Dean battling inner demons, Sam wrestling with impossible choices, or Crowley and Rowena walking the tightrope between villain and ally, every character brings something vital to the table. It’s the humanity behind these larger-than-life figures that makes *Supernatural* more than just a show about monsters—it’s a show about people, family, and the impossible lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.

## **The Classic Rock Soundtrack and Baby: The Heart and Soul of *Supernatural***

Let’s get one thing straight—*Supernatural* wouldn’t be *Supernatural* without its [killer classic rock soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7jbyn1EOcBopLl6SXISNYx?si=ZVoIA0FNTd2Q79YWRyXU4A&pi=u-okiyK605QK6L) and the Impala, better known as “Baby.” These aren’t just fun add-ons; they’re core characters in the show’s DNA. Dean’s love for classic rock and his dedication to Baby go beyond fandom quirks—they’re extensions of who he is, and by extension, what the show is all about.

First, the music. You hear the opening chords of Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” and suddenly, you’re not just watching a show—you’re stepping into an epic, fifteen-season journey. It’s the unofficial anthem of the Winchesters, and it hits with emotional weight every time it plays. But it doesn’t stop there. *Supernatural* treats classic rock like a gospel, with Dean as its faithful preacher. Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bob Seger—it’s all there. Whether it’s “Back in Black” roaring through an Impala montage or the bittersweet notes of Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” during one of those rare reflective moments, the music has always been the show’s soul.

And let’s not forget “Night Moves.” When Dean and Sam share a rare, carefree moment belting out Bob Seger’s iconic track in the car, it’s not just two brothers passing time—it’s a reminder that even in the middle of hunting monsters and fighting the apocalypse, they’re still human. They still *feel*. These songs aren’t just background noise—they’re emotional markers that tell the story as much as the dialogue does.

This soundtrack does more than fill silence—it gives the show its heartbeat. Dean rolling down the highway to “Back in Black” feels like a declaration. This isn’t just a random playlist; it’s a soundtrack with soul. And for the fans who grew up with these songs, it’s a nostalgic goldmine, bringing together the thrill of adventure and the comfort of familiarity in every riff and guitar solo. Whether it’s Rush’s “Working Man” pounding through an action-packed scene or “Renegade” by Styx building up to one of the show’s more tense moments, the music elevates the storytelling every single time.

Now, let’s talk about Baby—the *other* constant in Sam and Dean’s lives. This 1967 Chevy Impala isn’t just a car; she’s a Winchester in her own right. Baby is as much a part of the show as any character. She’s been through every monster hunt, every road trip, and every heartbreak. Dean’s love for her is more than just the pride of owning a classic car—Baby is home. She’s where the brothers retreat when the world gets too heavy, where they talk out their next move or sit in quiet, reflective moments while the radio hums with classic rock.

And then there’s the legendary episode “Baby,” where we get an entire story told from her perspective. It’s genius because it shows us what we’ve always known—Baby isn’t just a backdrop, she’s *central* to the Winchesters’ lives. Every dent, scratch, and repair tells a story. She’s carried them through battles with demons, angels, and even Death itself, and yet, no matter how bad things get, Baby keeps on rolling.

The best moments in *Supernatural* often come when the Impala tears down the road, music blaring, and you realize it’s more than just a scene—it’s the embodiment of freedom. When Bob Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” plays during quieter moments, it adds depth to the boys’ story. These aren’t just two guys saving the world—they’re two guys who’ve lost, who’ve sacrificed, and who still get back in that car and keep driving.

And let’s not forget how integral these two elements—music and Baby—are to the fans. Every time we hear “Carry On Wayward Son” or see the Impala glide through a night-lit highway, it brings us back to the heart of *Supernatural*: family, loyalty, and the idea that no matter how bad things get, you don’t stop fighting. The music and Baby are reminders that the Winchesters always keep moving forward. The music gives the show its pulse, and Baby? She gives it its heart.

Together, Baby and the soundtrack represent more than just cool cars and great music—they symbolize the unbreakable bond between the brothers and the freedom of life on the road. Dean’s devotion to Baby is about more than metal and wheels—it’s about roots, history, and the one constant in a life filled with chaos. And the classic rock soundtrack? It’s the spirit of *Supernatural*, carrying us through every battle, every tear, and every victory.

So yeah, Baby might just be a car and the music might just be a bunch of rock tracks, but in *Supernatural*, they’re everything. Together, they make the Winchesters’ journey more than just a fight against evil—they make it a road trip you never want to end.

## **The Balance Between Monster-of-the-Week, Epic Mythology, and Meta Episodes**

If *Supernatural* had stuck to just one formula, it wouldn’t have lasted 15 seasons. What makes this show work so brilliantly is its ability to walk the line between gripping standalone episodes (the infamous “monster-of-the-week” format), sprawling multi-season myth arcs, and bold, fourth-wall-breaking meta episodes that drag you deeper into the *Supernatural* universe with a wink and a smirk. This is a balancing act most shows can’t pull off—but *Supernatural*makes it look effortless.

The *monster-of-the-week* episodes are where the show leans into its roots. These are the stories that feel like urban legends brought to life: Wendigos, shapeshifters, Bloody Mary—all the creatures you grew up fearing—*Supernatural*served them up with eerie intensity. These episodes kept the show grounded, reminding us that no matter how high the stakes got, at its heart, it was about two brothers solving mysteries in the dark.

But then, *Supernatural* did something even smarter—it built a mythos that stretched far beyond the usual ghost story. As the series unfolded, it cracked open a bigger mythology, introducing demons, angels, Lucifer, and eventually, God Himself. And it wasn’t just expanding the stakes—it was creating an entire universe. That seamless switch from local hauntings to biblical showdowns is what gives the series its epic scale. The transition from “what’s that creepy thing in the dark?” to “oh, we’re fighting the actual apocalypse now” shouldn’t have worked this well. But somehow, it did.

Then came the secret weapon: *Supernatural*’s ability to laugh at itself. The show broke the fourth wall like no other, delivering *meta* episodes that poked fun at its own genre, fandom, and even its actors. These episodes weren’t just gimmicks—they were masterclasses in self-awareness, using humor to not only keep the audience entertained but also to highlight the show’s versatility. Episodes like “The French Mistake,” where Sam and Dean are tossed into an alternate universe where they’re actors in a TV show called *Supernatural*, are the perfect blend of absurdity and cleverness. You’ve got the Winchesters trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki poke fun at their real lives. It’s a ridiculous concept, but it works—and it’s just one example of how the show seamlessly merged its deep, emotional storytelling with moments of pure comedic genius.

But it didn’t stop there. Whether it was “Changing Channels,” which hilariously transported Sam and Dean through various TV show genres (hello, sitcom laugh track), or “Fan Fiction,” which took meta to a whole new level by turning the spotlight on the *Supernatural* fandom, these episodes dared to break the rules of traditional TV. And yet, even while poking fun at itself, the show never lost sight of its core themes: family, destiny, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.

These *meta* episodes gave the show room to breathe between the high-stakes mythology arcs and the creature-hunting adventures, allowing for moments of levity and creativity that kept fans hooked. One week, you’re watching Sam and Dean battle a vengeful spirit, and the next, they’re trapped in a fake version of their own lives or hilariously battling their way through TV parodies. And the best part? It never felt out of place. *Supernatural* had built such a flexible, layered world that even the most outlandish episodes fit into its broader narrative.

The show’s humor and willingness to poke fun at its own genre only strengthened its bond with fans. We weren’t just watching two brothers take on the apocalypse; we were in on the joke, laughing along as the writers playfully deconstructed the show’s own tropes. The fourth-wall-breaking episodes added a new dimension to the series, proving that *Supernatural* wasn’t afraid to take risks, mock itself, or fully embrace the weird.

Whether you’re watching an emotional myth arc about Heaven and Hell, a spooky creature-of-the-week, or a meta episode that leaves you laughing out loud, *Supernatural* mastered the art of keeping its audience on their toes. One moment you’re on the edge of your seat, the next you’re in stitches—but no matter what, you’re invested. That’s the magic of this show: the perfect balance of humor, horror, and heart.

## **Family and Sacrifice: The Heartbeat of *Supernatural***

“Saving people, hunting things—the family business.” It’s more than a catchphrase. For the Winchesters, it’s a creed. Right from the first episode, *Supernatural* drives home the fact that the Winchester family isn’t like most others. They don’t sit down for Sunday dinners or swap happy holiday stories. Their legacy is blood-soaked, hard-earned, and filled with impossible choices. For Sam and Dean, family isn’t just about genetics—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and the willingness to walk into hell (sometimes literally) to save the people you love.

But *Supernatural* doesn’t stop at biological bonds. While the show’s emotional center is Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection, it constantly reminds us that family is about more than blood. From Bobby Singer to Castiel, Charlie Bradbury to Jodie Mills, the Winchesters build a found family around them, one forged in battle and trust.

Bobby isn’t just the grizzled hunter who helps from the sidelines. He’s the father figure the brothers desperately needed after losing their own. And when Bobby sacrifices everything to protect Sam and Dean, it’s not out of duty—it’s love. His gruff “idjits” is always laced with affection, making his inevitable departure one of the series’ most heartbreaking moments. For Bobby, family meant being willing to give everything, even when there was nothing left to give.

Then there’s Castiel. The angel who started off as Heaven’s loyal soldier quickly became something far more complex—a brother in arms, a friend, and ultimately, family. Castiel’s arc is one of the most poignant examples of *Supernatural*‘s exploration of loyalty. His decision to fall from grace, to fight alongside the Winchesters instead of against them, represents the power of chosen family. Castiel’s ultimate sacrifice for Dean—driven by love, not duty—solidifies his place as a Winchester, proving that sometimes, the strongest family ties aren’t the ones we’re born with, but the ones we create.

And who could forget the fierce women of *Supernatural*? Charlie Bradbury might not have been born into the hunter life, but she earned her place through loyalty and guts. As a geeky, fearless hacker turned badass hunter, Charlie shows us that family can be chosen. Her bond with the Winchesters ran deep, and her tragic end still stings because she wasn’t just a friend—she was family. Jodie Mills, on the other hand, stepped into the role of protector, becoming a mother figure to a new generation of hunters. She didn’t have to take these lost girls under her wing, but she did because, in *Supernatural*, family is about showing up when no one else will.

Time and time again, *Supernatural* shows us that family means sacrifice. The Winchesters ask themselves the hard question: how far would you go for the people you love? And the answer is always: further than you think. Whether it’s Dean making deals with demons to save Sam, or Sam risking his life to pull Dean from the brink, their story is one of selflessness—sometimes to a fault.

And that’s where the real beauty of the show lies. It’s not just about hunting monsters or saving the world. It’s about the people you’re willing to stand beside in the fight. It’s about the love, loyalty, and sacrifice that define the Winchester legacy. Because in *Supernatural*, family isn’t just a bond—it’s a battle. And even when the stakes are cosmic, it always comes down to saving people and hunting things, because that’s the family business.

## **The Fandom That Kept It Alive: The Power of the SPN Family**

When we talk about *Supernatural*’s unprecedented 15-season run, there’s one undeniable force that carried the show through every twist, turn, and apocalyptic showdown: the *SPN Family*. It’s more than just a fanbase—this community of devoted viewers, creators, and passionate advocates became the backbone of *Supernatural*, driving its success and influencing the way fandoms interact with television today. From launching fan campaigns to attending conventions, the *SPN Family* didn’t just support the show—they helped shape it.

What makes *Supernatural* unique is how it built this loyal, worldwide following, despite starting off as an under-the-radar series on The WB (remember that network?). Back in 2005, *Supernatural* premiered to modest ratings, with no guarantee it would survive past its first season. The show might have flown under the radar of the mainstream critics, but the fans? They saw something special.

It wasn’t long before the *SPN Family* transformed into a cultural powerhouse, keeping *Supernatural* alive through low ratings, network shifts, and even a writer’s strike. While some shows rely solely on their storylines or cast to stay afloat, *Supernatural* had something extra: a fanbase that wasn’t afraid to fight for it. These weren’t casual viewers tuning in once a week—they were engaged, connected, and fiercely loyal.

Fan conventions were one of the biggest drivers behind this loyalty. Year after year, conventions like *Creation Entertainment’s Salute to Supernatural* became pilgrimage spots for fans to meet their favorite cast members, share their art, theories, and stories, and celebrate their love for the show. For many, these events were more than just photo-ops or autograph sessions—they were community-building hubs. Here, fans bonded over their shared love of all things Winchester, forming friendships and creating memories that transcended the screen.

But what truly sets the *SPN Family* apart is its activism. The fans didn’t just watch and engage—they gave back. From charity drives inspired by the cast to campaigns like *Random Acts* (founded by Misha Collins, the actor behind Castiel), the *SPN Family* showed that they were willing to take their love for the show and channel it into positive real-world change. It’s this deeper level of engagement that sets them apart from your average fandom.

And here’s the thing—the *Supernatural* team *knew* how much the fandom mattered. They weren’t just passive observers—they embraced the *SPN Family*, making them a part of the narrative. Episodes like “Fan Fiction” and “The Monster at the End of This Book” celebrated the fans in a way no other series had done before, blending real-life fandom with the fictional world of the Winchesters. In the meta episodes, the show didn’t just break the fourth wall—it leaned into it, acknowledging fan fiction, fan theories, and even shipping (Dean/Cas, anyone?) with a wink and a nod.

More than once, the *SPN Family* made the impossible happen. After all, it was fan dedication that helped push *Supernatural* into its 15th season, a feat almost unheard of in genre television. And when the show finally aired its last episode, the fandom didn’t just disappear. The community, built over 15 years of love, continues to thrive through fan projects, conventions, and online spaces dedicated to keeping the *Supernatural* spirit alive.

In an age where shows often live and die by network decisions or fluctuating ratings, *Supernatural* proved that the voice of the fans could be louder than any number crunching in a studio boardroom. The *SPN Family* wasn’t just a group of people who liked a show—they were the fuel that kept the engine running, year after year, apocalypse after apocalypse.

So, while the Winchesters may have closed the final chapter of their story, the *SPN Family* ensures that the legacy of *Supernatural* lives on. It’s a testament to the power of community, proving that when fans truly care, they can keep a story alive well beyond its final credits.

## **The Legacy of *Supernatural***

When the curtains finally closed on *Supernatural* after a monumental 15-season run, it was clear the show had left behind more than just a string of successful episodes. It had built a universe, a community, and a legacy that reshaped how genre TV could be experienced. What started as a story about two brothers hunting monsters morphed into a saga that dived deep into mythology, human emotion, and, most importantly, the concept of family—both by blood and by choice.

The show’s impact isn’t just measured by its episode count or ratings—it’s about the lives it touched. For many fans, *Supernatural* became more than just a weekly watch; it was a constant through the ups and downs of their lives. The show’s exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what’s right, even when it’s hard, resonated deeply. It gave viewers more than just entertainment—it offered comfort and a sense of belonging.

And let’s not forget the way *Supernatural* evolved the landscape of TV storytelling. It mixed procedural elements with an ongoing mythology in a way that allowed it to flex between epic apocalyptic plots and intimate character-driven moments. It embraced a *meta* sense of humor that blurred the line between fiction and reality, giving fans episodes that felt like inside jokes shared by a family—fitting for a show that always came back to the theme of familial bonds.

As for the cast, they weren’t just characters on a screen. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and the rest became household names, in no small part due to the accessibility and warmth they showed to their fans. It’s rare for a cast to engage so fully with their audience, and that, perhaps, is *Supernatural*’s real magic. The sense of community fostered between the creators, cast, and audience is something most shows can only dream of achieving. It’s why, even after the final episode aired, the *SPN Family* continues to thrive.

At its core, *Supernatural* was about more than just hunting monsters or saving the world. It was about connection—the connection between characters, the connection between the show and its audience, and the connections it fostered between fans around the globe. For 15 years, *Supernatural* wasn’t just a show; it was a phenomenon. And in that time, it proved one truth above all else: that family doesn’t end in blood | **15 Years of Saving People, Hunting Things: The Supernatural Phenomenon**

**Why Supernatural Endured for 15 Seasons**
Fifteen seasons. Over 300 episodes. That’s not just a show—it’s a legacy. _Supernatural_ wasn’t just about monster hunts or witty one-liners (though it had plenty of those). It was about two brothers, their iconic Chevy Impala, and the kind of storytelling that digs deep, pulls at your heart, and keeps you hooked until the very end.

At its core, _Supernatural_ was a masterclass in blending horror, humor, and raw emotion. It’s no surprise the SPN Family remains as passionate as ever—because this show wasn’t just something you watched, it was something you felt. Whether the Winchester brothers were fighting demons or angels, it was always about their bond. That’s the heartbeat of _Supernatural_.

So what made _Supernatural_ stand out? From the unforgettable chemistry between Sam and Dean to the perfect mix of epic mythology and iconic episodes, _Supernatural_ earned its place as one of TV’s greatest—and even after 15 seasons, we still can’t stop talking about it.

**Sam and Dean: The Unbreakable Bond at Supernatural’s Core**
At the center of _Supernatural_ is one undeniable truth: this show is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean Winchester. Sure, they’ve battled everything from shape-shifters to archangels, but the real fight has always been for each other. Their bond goes beyond just being brothers—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and that deep, unspoken connection that keeps them pushing forward no matter the cost.

Sam and Dean aren’t just characters—they’ve become a blueprint for what makes a dynamic duo truly great. Dean, with his tough-as-nails exterior and unshakeable devotion, and Sam, the thoughtful, conflicted younger brother trying to balance family duty with his own desires, are the emotional heartbeat of the series. Together, they aren’t just fighting monsters—they’re fighting fate, destiny, and everything in between.

What makes their relationship so powerful is the constant tug-of-war between their deep love for one another and the weight of the sacrifices they make. Each of them has literally gone to Hell and back for the other, and these moments of sacrifice hit hard because they feel real. It’s the kind of relationship that sticks with you long after the credits roll. No matter how intense the monster hunts get, it’s always the quieter, more intimate moments between Sam and Dean that resonate the most.

The Winchester brothers are the reason we keep coming back. Their chemistry is electric, their struggles are relatable, and their bond is unbreakable. At the end of the day, _Supernatural_ isn’t just about saving the world—it’s about saving each other, and that’s what makes it special.

**A Perfect Blend: Horror, Comedy, Drama, and Heart**
_Supernatural_ is a masterclass in genre-blending. This show doesn’t just play in one sandbox—it takes over the entire playground. Horror? Check. Comedy? Absolutely. Drama? You bet. And somehow, it manages to weave all of these elements together without missing a beat.

Let’s start with the horror. We’re talking everything from classic ghost hunts to full-on battles with demons and angels. The scares are real, but _Supernatural_ never leans too hard into the gloom. Just when you’re clutching your blanket, Dean drops a snarky one-liner or Castiel gives you that wonderfully deadpan confusion, and suddenly you’re laughing. It’s this perfect pivot between tension and humor that keeps the show fresh and—dare I say it—fun.

But here’s where _Supernatural_ really nails it: the heart. Beneath all the monster slaying and apocalyptic drama, this is a show about family and sacrifice. Every episode, no matter how wild the plot gets, is anchored by Sam and Dean’s relationship. They’ll literally go to Hell (and back) for each other, and the emotional depth that brings is what turns a good show into a great one.

The genius of _Supernatural_ is that it never lets one genre overpower the others. It’s as comfortable delivering gut-punching emotional moments as it is making you jump out of your seat or burst out laughing. And that balance? That’s why fans keep coming back—because with _Supernatural_, you’re getting the best of every world.

**The Supernatural Mythology: From Urban Legends to Apocalyptic Battles**
If you thought _Supernatural_ was just about hunting ghosts and taking down demons, think again. This show goes all-in when it comes to mythology—pulling from urban legends, religious lore, and just about every spooky story you’ve ever heard whispered around a campfire. It’s like a folklore buffet, and _Supernatural_ serves it up hot.

The early seasons keep it tight with classic monster-of-the-week vibes: wendigos, shapeshifters, cursed mirrors—you name it, Sam and Dean have faced it. But here’s where the show really flexes its creative muscles. As it grows, so does the mythology, until we’re no longer just talking about salt lines and silver bullets. Suddenly, we’re dealing with fallen angels, biblical prophecies, and—oh yeah—Lucifer himself. This isn’t your average horror show; this is epic, universe-spanning storytelling.

_Supernatural_ does what few other shows manage—it constantly raises the stakes without collapsing under the weight of its own lore. It takes bold swings. One season, you’re dealing with a local haunting, the next, you’re questioning the very nature of free will and destiny as Sam and Dean go toe-to-toe with God. Yeah, it gets that big. But no matter how grand the mythology gets, the story never forgets where it started—on the road, in that Impala, with two brothers just trying to survive.

The genius lies in the balance. The show dances between grounded urban legends and sweeping, cosmic battles, and somehow, it all works. The lore isn’t just background noise either—it’s integral to the emotional weight of the series. Every demon exorcised, every angelic encounter adds layers to Sam and Dean’s journey, and by the end, you’re not just watching a TV show—you’re knee-deep in a modern myth.

**Character Growth and Evolution: From Hunters to Heroes**
Let’s get one thing straight—_Supernatural_ wouldn’t be the powerhouse it is without its incredible character work. Sure, the monsters, demons, and angels are fun, but it’s the characters that keep us coming back. Over 15 seasons, these aren’t just hunters—they’re heroes, villains, and everything in between, evolving in ways that make them feel real and raw.

We’ve got Sam and Dean, obviously, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. _Supernatural_ thrives because it fills its world with characters who are as complex as they are iconic, whether they’re wielding a blade, throwing a sarcastic quip, or breaking your heart in ways you didn’t see coming.

**The Winchester Brothers: Heart of the Show**
Let’s start where it all began: Sam and Dean. These two aren’t just brothers—they’re the emotional core of the entire series. From episode one, it’s clear their bond is what makes this show different. Sure, they fight demons and battle the apocalypse on a regular basis, but at the end of the day, Supernatural is a story about family.

Dean, the hardened, tough-love protector, grows from a cocky hunter into a deeply vulnerable character, grappling with self-worth and purpose. His bravado might be the surface, but underneath is a man who’d throw himself into Hell (literally) for the people he loves. Dean is a walking paradox: a man who craves love but feels he doesn’t deserve it. By the end, his arc feels like an emotional marathon—you’ve seen him win, lose, and keep fighting even when all hope is gone.

And then there’s Sam. The younger Winchester brother starts out wanting nothing to do with the hunter life, but as the series progresses, we watch him become the moral compass, even when that means making brutal sacrifices. He wrestles with dark powers, addiction, and self-doubt, but somehow, Sam always finds his way back to the fight. His journey from idealistic college kid to seasoned hero with a complicated past makes him one of the most dynamic characters on TV.

**Bobby Singer: The Reluctant Mentor Turned Father Figure**
Bobby Singer didn’t just help Sam and Dean fight monsters—he taught them how to survive in a world where evil was as constant as the rising sun. From the moment Bobby entered their lives, he wasn’t just another hunter in the background; he became the mentor they needed after losing their father. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural and his no-nonsense approach to hunting, Bobby became the man the brothers could turn to when things got rough, a guiding voice when John Winchester’s strict code of survival wasn’t enough.

What made Bobby stand out was that he wasn’t a stereotypical mentor. He was gruff, stubborn, and unapologetically real. But beneath that tough exterior, Bobby had a heart of gold—and a deep, almost paternal love for Sam and Dean. He didn’t just teach them how to fight; he taught them how to think. Bobby wasn’t afraid to call the boys out on their mistakes, pushing them to be better hunters, better brothers, and better men.

And let’s not forget his intellectual prowess. Bobby was the go-to source for lore, rituals, and all things supernatural. When Sam and Dean were stumped, Bobby had the answers, usually found buried in one of his many old, dusty books. His combination of intellect and heart made him indispensable to the Winchester’s journey.

More than anything, Bobby’s presence grounded Sam and Dean. He was their anchor, the one person who wasn’t afraid to show them tough love while also being the emotional support they so desperately needed. He wasn’t just a hunter or a friend—he was family, shaping the brothers into the heroes they would ultimately become.

**Castiel: The Angel Who Fell (In More Ways Than One)**
Now, let’s talk about _Castiel_, the angel who became so much more than just a celestial being. Castiel starts out as a soldier of Heaven, but his journey quickly takes him down a more human path. He learns about loyalty, sacrifice, and love—not from the angels above, but from Sam and Dean.

Castiel’s evolution is one of the most emotionally satisfying parts of the series. His deadpan humor and awkward attempts to understand human behavior give the show some of its best comedic moments, but it’s his growing humanity that really tugs at the heartstrings. He transforms from a rigid, obedient angel to a fiercely loyal friend, even when it means defying Heaven’s orders. By the end, Castiel isn’t just an angel—he’s family. His ultimate sacrifice, fueled by love, is one of the show’s most heartbreaking and powerful moments, cementing his place as a fan favorite.

**Crowley: The Demon with a Heart (Maybe)**
Now, enter _Crowley_, the self-proclaimed “King of Hell” who somehow becomes one of the most beloved characters in the show. Crowley isn’t your typical villain—he’s equal parts sinister and hilarious, wielding sarcasm like a weapon. He dances in the grey area between good and evil, forming uneasy alliances with Sam and Dean that blur the lines of morality. Crowley’s evolution is wild: from ruthless demon to someone who shows flashes of loyalty and, dare I say, compassion. He’s the bad guy you hate to love, but can’t stop rooting for. The man makes deals with souls, but still manages to feel like a necessary part of the Winchester family.

**Lucifer: The Devil in the Details**
And speaking of villains—let’s not forget _Lucifer_. You’d expect the Devil to be all fire and brimstone, but Supernatural gives us a version of him that’s sharp-tongued, manipulative, and, oddly enough, a little charismatic. He’s the ultimate Big Bad, but Lucifer’s complexity goes deeper than just being evil incarnate. He’s a character who feels betrayed, cast aside by his own father (God), and, as twisted as it sounds, you almost get him. Almost. Lucifer is unpredictable in the best way—one minute, he’s terrifying, and the next, he’s delivering one of the funniest lines in the show. That’s the beauty of _Supernatural_—even the most sinister characters have layers.

**Rowena: Witch with Ambition**
Let’s talk about _Rowena_. If you thought Crowley was complicated, his mother takes it to another level. Rowena starts out as a cunning, ruthless witch who’s only out for herself. But over time, she evolves into something much more intriguing—a fiercely independent character who eventually shows depth beyond her manipulative facade. Rowena’s growth from power-hungry villain to someone capable of sacrifice gives us one of the richest character arcs in the series. Plus, her sharp tongue and witty one-liners make every scene she’s in a delight. Rowena is the kind of character who proves that even the baddest of witches can change—if only on her own terms.

**Charlie Bradbury: The Nerdy Hero We Needed**
_Charlie Bradbury_ was the fandom’s heart, the geek girl who jumped into the Winchester world and held her own. A brilliant hacker turned hunter, she brought an infectious energy to the series. Charlie was quirky, brave, and endlessly resourceful. Her relationship with Sam and Dean evolved into something like family—proving that not all bonds in _Supernatural_ are forged in blood. Charlie represented the fan in all of us, geeking out over LARPing one minute and slaying monsters the next. Her tragic end hit hard because we saw so much of ourselves in her—a reminder that in Supernatural, no one is safe, not even the ones who make us smile the most.

_Supernatural’s_ genius lies in its characters—each one layered, each one evolving in unexpected ways. Whether it’s Dean battling inner demons, Sam wrestling with impossible choices, or Crowley and Rowena walking the tightrope between villain and ally, every character brings something vital to the table. It’s the humanity behind these larger-than-life figures that makes _Supernatural_ more than just a show about monsters—it’s a show about people, family, and the impossible lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.

**The Classic Rock Soundtrack and Baby: The Heart and Soul of Supernatural**
Let’s get one thing straight—_Supernatural_ wouldn’t be _Supernatural_ without its killer classic rock soundtrack and the Impala, better known as “Baby.” These aren’t just fun add-ons; they’re core characters in the show’s DNA. Dean’s love for classic rock and his dedication to Baby go beyond fandom quirks—they’re extensions of who he is, and by extension, what the show is all about.

First, the music. You hear the opening chords of Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” and suddenly, you’re not just watching a show—you’re stepping into an epic, fifteen-season journey. It’s the unofficial anthem of the Winchesters, and it hits with emotional weight every time it plays. But it doesn’t stop there. Supernatural treats classic rock like a gospel, with Dean as its faithful preacher. Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bob Seger—it’s all there. Whether it’s “Back in Black” roaring through an Impala montage or the bittersweet notes of Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” during one of those rare reflective moments, the music has always been the show’s soul.

And let’s not forget “Night Moves.” When Dean and Sam share a rare, carefree moment belting out Bob Seger’s iconic track in the car, it’s not just two brothers passing time—it’s a reminder that even in the middle of hunting monsters and fighting the apocalypse, they’re still human. They still feel. These songs aren’t just background noise—they’re emotional markers that tell the story as much as the dialogue does.

This soundtrack does more than fill silence—it gives the show its heartbeat. Dean rolling down the highway to “Back in Black” feels like a declaration. This isn’t just a random playlist; it’s a soundtrack with soul. And for the fans who grew up with these songs, it’s a nostalgic goldmine, bringing together the thrill of adventure and the comfort of familiarity in every riff and guitar solo. Whether it’s Rush’s “Working Man” pounding through an action-packed scene or “Renegade” by Styx building up to one of the show’s more tense moments, the music elevates the storytelling every single time.

Now, let’s talk about _Baby_—the other constant in Sam and Dean’s lives. This 1967 Chevy Impala isn’t just a car; she’s a Winchester in her own right. Baby is as much a part of the show as any character. She’s been through every monster hunt, every road trip, and every heartbreak. Dean’s love for her is more than just the pride of owning a classic car—Baby is home. She’s where the brothers retreat when the world gets too heavy, where they talk out their next move or sit in quiet, reflective moments while the radio hums with classic rock.

And then there’s the legendary episode “Baby,” where we get an entire story told from her perspective. It’s genius because it shows us what we’ve always known—Baby isn’t just a backdrop, she’s _central_ to the Winchesters’ lives. Every dent, scratch, and repair tells a story. She’s carried them through battles with demons, angels, and even Death itself, and yet, no matter how bad things get, Baby keeps on rolling.

The best moments in _Supernatural_ often come when the Impala tears down the road, music blaring, and you realize it’s more than just a scene—it’s the embodiment of freedom. When Bob Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” plays during quieter moments, it adds depth to the boys’ story. These aren’t just two guys saving the world—they’re two guys who’ve lost, who’ve sacrificed, and who still get back in that car and keep driving.

And let’s not forget how integral these two elements—music and Baby—are to the fans. Every time we hear “Carry On Wayward Son” or see the Impala glide through a night-lit highway, it brings us back to the heart of _Supernatural_: family, loyalty, and the idea that no matter how bad things get, you don’t stop fighting. The music and Baby are reminders that the Winchesters always keep moving forward. The music gives the show its pulse, and Baby? She gives it its heart.

Together, Baby and the soundtrack represent more than just cool cars and great music—they symbolize the unbreakable bond between the brothers and the freedom of life on the road. Dean’s devotion to Baby is about more than metal and wheels—it’s about roots, history, and the one constant in a life filled with chaos. And the classic rock soundtrack? It’s the spirit of _Supernatural_, carrying us through every battle, every tear, and every victory.

So yeah, Baby might just be a car and the music might just be a bunch of rock tracks, but in _Supernatural_, they’re everything. Together, they make the Winchesters’ journey more than just a fight against evil—they make it a road trip you never want to end.

**The Balance Between Monster-of-the-Week, Epic Mythology, and Meta Episodes**
If _Supernatural_ had stuck to just one formula, it wouldn’t have lasted 15 seasons. What makes this show work so brilliantly is its ability to walk the line between gripping standalone episodes (the infamous “monster-of-the-week” format), sprawling multi-season myth arcs, and bold, fourth-wall-breaking meta episodes that drag you deeper into the _Supernatural_ universe with a wink and a smirk. This is a balancing act most shows can’t pull off—but _Supernatural_ makes it look effortless.

The monster-of-the-week episodes are where the show leans into its roots. These are the stories that feel like urban legends brought to life: Wendigos, shapeshifters, Bloody Mary—all the creatures you grew up fearing—_Supernatural_ served them up with eerie intensity. These episodes kept the show grounded, reminding us that no matter how high the stakes got, at its heart, it was about two brothers solving mysteries in the dark.

But then, _Supernatural_ did something even smarter—it built a mythos that stretched far beyond the usual ghost story. As the series unfolded, it cracked open a bigger mythology, introducing demons, angels, Lucifer, and eventually, God Himself. And it wasn’t just expanding the stakes—it was creating an entire universe. That seamless switch from local hauntings to biblical showdowns is what gives the series its epic scale. The transition from “what’s that creepy thing in the dark?” to “oh, we’re fighting the actual apocalypse now” shouldn’t have worked this well. But somehow, it did.

Then came the secret weapon: _Supernatural’s_ ability to laugh at itself. The show broke the fourth wall like no other, delivering meta episodes that poked fun at its own genre, fandom, and even its actors. These episodes weren’t just gimmicks—they were masterclasses in self-awareness, using humor to not only keep the audience entertained but also to highlight the show’s versatility. Episodes like “The French Mistake,” where Sam and Dean are tossed into an alternate universe where they’re actors in a TV show called _Supernatural_, are the perfect blend of absurdity and cleverness. You’ve got the Winchesters trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki poke fun at their real lives. It’s a ridiculous concept, but it works—and it’s just one example of how the show seamlessly merged its deep, emotional storytelling with moments of pure comedic genius.

But it didn’t stop there. Whether it was “Changing Channels,” which hilariously transported Sam and Dean through various TV show genres (hello, sitcom laugh track), or “Fan Fiction,” which took meta to a whole new level by turning the spotlight on the _Supernatural_ fandom, these episodes dared to break the rules of traditional TV. And yet, even while poking fun at itself, the show never lost sight of its core themes: family, destiny, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.

These meta episodes gave the show room to breathe between the high-stakes mythology arcs and the creature-hunting adventures, allowing for moments of levity and creativity that kept fans hooked. One week, you’re watching Sam and Dean battle a vengeful spirit, and the next, they’re trapped in a fake version of their own lives or hilariously battling their way through TV parodies. And the best part? It never felt out of place. _Supernatural_ had built such a flexible, layered world that even the most outlandish episodes fit into its broader narrative.

The show’s humor and willingness to poke fun at its own genre only strengthened its bond with fans. We weren’t just watching two brothers take on the apocalypse; we were in on the joke, laughing along as the writers playfully deconstructed the show’s own tropes. The fourth-wall-breaking episodes added a new dimension to the series, proving that _Supernatural_ wasn’t afraid to take risks, mock itself, or fully embrace the weird.

Whether you’re watching an emotional myth arc about Heaven and Hell, a spooky creature-of-the-week, or a meta episode that leaves you laughing out loud, _Supernatural_ mastered the art of keeping its audience on their toes. One moment you’re on the edge of your seat, the next you’re in stitches—but no matter what, you’re invested. That’s the magic of this show: the perfect balance of humor, horror, and heart.

**Family and Sacrifice: The Heartbeat of Supernatural**
“Saving people, hunting things—the family business.” It’s more than a catchphrase. For the Winchesters, it’s a creed. Right from the first episode, _Supernatural_ drives home the fact that the Winchester family isn’t like most others. They don’t sit down for Sunday dinners or swap happy holiday stories. Their legacy is blood-soaked, hard-earned, and filled with impossible choices. For Sam and Dean, family isn’t just about genetics—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and the willingness to walk into hell (sometimes literally) to save the people you love.

But _Supernatural_ doesn’t stop at biological bonds. While the show’s emotional center is Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection, it constantly reminds us that family is about more than blood. From Bobby Singer to Castiel, Charlie Bradbury to Jodie Mills, the Winchesters build a found family around them, one forged in battle and trust.

Bobby isn’t just the grizzled hunter who helps from the sidelines. He’s the father figure the brothers desperately needed after losing their own. And when Bobby sacrifices everything to protect Sam and Dean, it’s not out of duty—it’s love. His gruff “idjits” is always laced with affection, making his inevitable departure one of the series’ most heartbreaking moments. For Bobby, family meant being willing to give everything, even when there was nothing left to give.

Then there’s Castiel. The angel who started off as Heaven’s loyal soldier quickly became something far more complex—a brother in arms, a friend, and ultimately, family. Castiel’s arc is one of the most poignant examples of _Supernatural’s_ exploration of loyalty. His decision to fall from grace, to fight alongside the Winchesters instead of against them, represents the power of chosen family. Castiel’s ultimate sacrifice for Dean—driven by love, not duty—solidifies his place as a Winchester, proving that sometimes, the strongest family ties aren’t the ones we’re born with, but the ones we create.

And who could forget the fierce women of _Supernatural_? Charlie Bradbury might not have been born into the hunter life, but she earned her place through loyalty and guts. As a geeky, fearless hacker turned badass hunter, Charlie shows us that family can be chosen. Her bond with the Winchesters ran deep, and her tragic end still stings because she wasn’t just a friend—she was family. Jodie Mills, on the other hand, stepped into the role of protector, becoming a mother figure to a new generation of hunters. She didn’t have to take these lost girls under her wing, but she did because, in _Supernatural_, family is about showing up when no one else will.

Time and time again, _Supernatural_ shows us that family means sacrifice. The Winchesters ask themselves the hard question: how far would you go for the people you love? And the answer is always: further than you think. Whether it’s Dean making deals with demons to save Sam, or Sam risking his life to pull Dean from the brink, their story is one of selflessness—sometimes to a fault.

And that’s where the real beauty of the show lies. It’s not just about hunting monsters or saving the world. It’s about the people you’re willing to stand beside in the fight. It’s about the love, loyalty, and sacrifice that define the Winchester legacy. Because in _Supernatural_, family isn’t just a bond—it’s a battle. And even when the stakes are cosmic, it always comes down to saving people and hunting things, because that’s the family business.

**The Fandom That Kept It Alive: The Power of the SPN Family**
When we talk about _Supernatural_ unprecedented 15-season run, there’s one undeniable force that carried the show through every twist, turn, and apocalyptic showdown: the SPN Family. It’s more than just a fanbase—this community of devoted viewers, creators, and passionate advocates became the backbone of _Supernatural_, driving its success and influencing the way fandoms interact with television today. From launching fan campaigns to attending conventions, the SPN Family didn’t just support the show—they helped shape it.

What makes _Supernatural_ unique is how it built this loyal, worldwide following, despite starting off as an under-the-radar series on The WB (remember that network?). Back in 2005, _Supernatural_ premiered to modest ratings, with no guarantee it would survive past its first season. The show might have flown under the radar of the mainstream critics, but the fans? They saw something special.

It wasn’t long before the SPN Family transformed into a cultural powerhouse, keeping _Supernatural_ alive through low ratings, network shifts, and even a writer’s strike. While some shows rely solely on their storylines or cast to stay afloat, _Supernatural_ had something extra: a fanbase that wasn’t afraid to fight for it. These weren’t casual viewers tuning in once a week—they were engaged, connected, and fiercely loyal.

Fan conventions were one of the biggest drivers behind this loyalty. Year after year, conventions like Creation Entertainment’s Salute to Supernatural became pilgrimage spots for fans to meet their favorite cast members, share their art, theories, and stories, and celebrate their love for the show. For many, these events were more than just photo-ops or autograph sessions—they were community-building hubs. Here, fans bonded over their shared love of all things Winchester, forming friendships and creating memories that transcended the screen.
But what truly sets the SPN Family apart is its activism. The fans didn’t just watch and engage—they gave back. From charity drives inspired by the cast to campaigns like Random Acts (founded by Misha Collins, the actor behind Castiel), the SPN Family showed that they were willing to take their love for the show and channel it into positive real-world change. It’s this deeper level of engagement that sets them apart from your average fandom.

And here’s the thing—the _Supernatural_ team knew how much the fandom mattered. They weren’t just passive observers—they embraced the SPN Family, making them a part of the narrative. Episodes like “Fan Fiction” and “The Monster at the End of This Book” celebrated the fans in a way no other series had done before, blending real-life fandom with the fictional world of the Winchesters. In the meta episodes, the show didn’t just break the fourth wall—it leaned into it, acknowledging fan fiction, fan theories, and even shipping (Dean/Cas, anyone?) with a wink and a nod.

More than once, the SPN Family made the impossible happen. After all, it was fan dedication that helped push _Supernatural_ into its 15th season, a feat almost unheard of in genre television. And when the show finally aired its last episode, the fandom didn’t just disappear. The community, built over 15 years of love, continues to thrive through fan projects, conventions, and online spaces dedicated to keeping the _Supernatural_ spirit alive.

In an age where shows often live and die by network decisions or fluctuating ratings, _Supernatural_ proved that the voice of the fans could be louder than any number crunching in a studio boardroom. The SPN Family wasn’t just a group of people who liked a show—they were the fuel that kept the engine running, year after year, apocalypse after apocalypse.

So, while the Winchesters may have closed the final chapter of their story, the SPN Family ensures that the legacy of _Supernatural_ lives on. It’s a testament to the power of community, proving that when fans truly care, they can keep a story alive well beyond its final credits.

**The Legacy of Supernatural**
When the curtains finally closed on _Supernatural_ after a monumental 15-season run, it was clear the show had left behind more than just a string of successful episodes. It had built a universe, a community, and a legacy that reshaped how genre TV could be experienced. What started as a story about two brothers hunting monsters morphed into a saga that dived deep into mythology, human emotion, and, most importantly, the concept of family—both by blood and by choice.

The show’s impact isn’t just measured by its episode count or ratings—it’s about the lives it touched. For many fans, _Supernatural_ became more than just a weekly watch; it was a constant through the ups and downs of their lives. The show’s exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what’s right, even when it’s hard, resonated deeply. It gave viewers more than just entertainment—it offered comfort and a sense of belonging.

And let’s not forget the way _Supernatural_ evolved the landscape of TV storytelling. It mixed procedural elements with an ongoing mythology in a way that allowed it to flex between epic apocalyptic plots and intimate character-driven moments. It embraced a _meta_ sense of humor that blurred the line between fiction and reality, giving fans episodes that felt like inside jokes shared by a family—fitting for a show that always came back to the theme of familial bonds.

As for the cast, they weren’t just characters on a screen. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and the rest became household names, in no small part due to the accessibility and warmth they showed to their fans. It’s rare for a cast to engage so fully with their audience, and that, perhaps, is _Supernatural’s_ real magic. The sense of community fostered between the creators, cast, and audience is something most shows can only dream of achieving. It’s why, even after the final episode aired, the SPN Family continues to thrive.

Despite its rather liberal happy-clappy perspective with most of its secondary storylines, TWW is exceptionally well-written and very rarely fails to deliver some rather thought-provoking episodes. 

I have had many boxset marathons with this show over the years, and I must admit my adulation for certain seasons has changed somewhat in that time. Back then I adored the first 4 seasons, while dismissing season 5 outright, and only having a grudging respect for seasons 6 & 7. But these days I much prefer 6&7 over 1, 3 and 4. No idea why but there you go!

As for the acting, well other than Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe and John Spencer the first few seasons were a cast of relative unknowns, but come the middle of S1 it doesn't matter because the likes of Alison Janey's CJ, Bradley Whitford's wonderful Josh Lyman and Richard Schiff's brooding Toby Ziegler play their roles exceptionally well.

Of course the greatest aspect of this show is the writing, especially for the first four seasons when Aaron Sorkin was directly involved. And even after he left under a cloud the writing for season 5 and beyond was still very good, if a little uneven.

It has been awhile since I last picked up on this show. So come the winter months I might just snuggle down and enjoy the walk & talk with these guys once again. | If every program on TV was this good I'd never leave the house.

I have to agree with the reviewers who call this the best drama show ever, at least for entertainment value. Of course, it gets panned often for political reasons by people who perhaps don't watch it enough to see that, yes, it is a liberal administration being represented here, but they often make mistakes and fail in their efforts, so it is hardly a progressive utopia. 

I write novels in my spare tome, and I like to think my dialogue is a strong point, so I have nothing but admiration for the fast and witty conversations in this show. You may literally have to watch the series a second time to catch everything thrown at you in their quick back and forth banter, often delivered as they pace around the West Wing set. But that is no hardship either. Much has been made about Aaron Sorkin's departure from the show, and perhaps there was a slight drop in quality because of it, but it was still well worth watching. It was so good, the new kids couldn't break it. | The first edition, indeed season, of this political drama is as good as it gets. Aaron Sorkin has created a monster - in just about every sense - and the cast led by Martin Sheen (""President Bartlet"") consistently deliver well as the senior advisors in his administration - alongside some sadly infrequent appearances from his no-nonsense wife (Stockard Channing) - guide us through the daily trials and tribulations accompanying American government. For the most part, the pace is hectic, controlled (sometimes) by the calming, sagacious influence of his Chief of Staff ""Leo"" (John Spencer) and deals with just about every sort of scenario - domestic, foreign, familial and collegiate that comes across the paths of the Director of Communications (Richard Schiff), his deputy (Rob Lowe), the Press Secretary (Allison Janney) as well as ""Josh Lyman"" (Bradley Whitford) - the passionate but occasional liability that is the deputy Chief of Staff. Sorkin and the cast manage, effortlessly, to create a series of scenarios that reminded me of both ""Yes, Minister"" and the original (British) ""House of Cards"" - comedy and humour expertly mixed with politicking on a grand, yet personal, scale. Nothing is off limits insofar as the subjects covered and it presents as authentic a depiction of government as we are ever likely to see. Personally, I though Stockard Channing added loads to this as the First Lady and Janney and Spencer's characters gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, someone in there knew what the hell was going on. Of course it takes an hugely American perspective on things, which as a non-American grated a bit on occasion with an intermingling of fact and fiction that sometimes compromised the integrity of the stories; but in the main it is one hell of a watch. Unfortunately, around about the start of series four, the writing starts to slide and the cast - fresh and vibrant at the beginning of the run - begin to take too great a role behind the camera; the plots become too personal (even romantic) and far-fetched. The original stars feature a bit less and it loses much of it's potency and it's plausibility. Certainly, the last two series which focus on presidential succession and sidelined many of the cast we had followed since day one left me cold and disinterested. By the conclusion I felt there had been maybe two series too many... At it's best, it is great, thought-provoking, entertainment though and well worth binging on. | Pepa the Pig for Adult Liberals. Or maybe, ""Mickey Mouse Takes Office."" I can't decide.

Perhaps I'm hyper sensitive, having been what equates to an American liberal for most of my life (I'm Danish, and here being liberal puts you on the right, but I've been a lefty for more than forty years), but trying to watch this show instantly fatigues me. Not because of the acting, which is above average, the dialog, which is well-written if overly verbose, not even the stories, which seem implausible but entertaining, and this IS fiction, so you need to allow for unrealistic and entertaining things happening 24/7. Otherwise it'd get boring.

No, what drains my energy is the way it treats me as a mental toddler. It's the way the resentment for people with opposing views (conservatives, religious people, etc.) is matched only by the self-righteousness and the conviction of having the moral high ground and superior intelligence. The ease with which people are divided into moral and immoral boxes based on their religious views, political affiliation, or even demography. And isn't it nice, because we all agree that religious zealots are terrible, right? That conservatives are immoral, right? That Texans are stupid, right? Lucky we have our club, where we're educated, virtuous and bearers of The Right Morals™. 

Episode one present a religiously based conflict that is so overly constructed that it borders on pathetic (hence my Pepa the Pig reference). The conflict is resolved not through discussion or discourse, but by president Mickey Mouse turning up and revealing how the religious group is in cahoots with people sending his twelve-year-old daughter a death threat in the form of basically a voodoo doll. How convenient. Such lazy writing. I wonder how a diplomatic person with some deep rhetorical skills might have solved that conflict in lieu of one side basically declaring moral bankruptcy. I don't know, maybe some kind of political figure, like a head of state or something. Guess that's for another show. This show has trumpets blaring instead, while the camera pans across our great imaginary president Highground. 

Just for the record, even though my father was a priest and I was raised Christian, today I think religion is garbage and I've been an atheist for about 25 years. But that's my opinion and it says nothing about my moral values, and what anyone else believes doesn't either. I just don't appreciate this lazy and presumptuous ""religious conservative therefore bad, amirite?"" fallacy. 

I quit at the beginning of episode two, when President Mouse basically says they didn't lose Texas in the primaries because of a joke about cowboy hats, but because Texans are stupid, or ""when the president learned Latin,"" as it puts it. One has to wonder if the writers just don't care about alienating an entire state of potential viewers, or if they think Texans are so stupid they didn't catch that insult. Either way, the club that you're supposed to be in to be able to watch something like this and think it's okay to disrespect your opponent's intelligence and points of view in this manner is not one I want to be a member of. Not anymore. 

I'm done with this restrictive and divisive club of supposedly morally superior intelligencia, with the undercurrent of resentment and obnoxious entitlement. I'm sick and tired of having echo chamber ""discussions"" where you constantly fear stepping out of line lest you be called a bigot, or a racist, or a misogynist, or a Nazi, or whatever is the most efficient card you can use to shut down even the slightest sign of dissent from the implicit party line. 

And yes, as I said, I'm probably hyper sensitive because this to me is such a large problem right now, but that's why I can't watch this. I'm surprised a show from 1999 is this blatantly and unapologetically biased, but maybe that's because I've been liberal myself all that time and it just seemed okay. I mean, the religious and conservatives ARE wrong, and mostly idiots, right? To my religious and conservative friends who watch this and get rightfully offended, from a former liberal who thought this was okay, even truth, and behalf of my other liberal friends who still think like this but aren't bad people, I apologize. 

And think of it like this: With shows like these being made, and much worse media content being released currently,  some people, like me, get increasingly turned off by the divisiveness and implicit brainwashing, to the point where they simply stop being liberals. I don't know what I'm gonna vote next time, but it won't be left. If I were American, I wouldn't vote Democrat. But then, there'd have to be a candidate other than Trump, because I don't think that guy has America's interests at heart, only his own.",True

My wife watched the entire set of series without me as it seemed we already had a lot to watch together. She enjoyed it and at some point I decided to watch it and she elected to watch it again with me. 

It is very witty and intelligent and, if you don’t mind every episode using the same wit and rapid fire word association and social references on and on, it is great fun. Once in a while they take it a bit too far and a character who has not shown great wit and humor comes out with a jewel. I can understand the writers wouldn’t want to waste the line.

They have two Sam and Diane characters (Lorelai and Luke) as a “will they or won’t they” romance — you know, from the tv show Cheers where they bend every script to bring them close to a romance, but oh, not quite. A lot of shows have done it since then (and probably before also. I mean they kept Mary Tyler Moore single as Mary Richards because she had dome the housewife thing in the Dick Van Dyke Show).

The show does really well at staying consistent, especially considering how many episodes there were each season. So even when it wears a bit thin for me, (for example, the Kurt character really gets old for me as they seem to have him do absolutely everything a minor guess character could do better. Did they not want to pay character actors?) it is still better than most shows out there. 

I feel I should add that I usually wait until I have watched the entire run of a show before reviewing it, because sometimes even good programs deteriorate or jump the shark. You know, when  show does something totally out of character or unbelievable to boost ratings or juice it up. Apparently the term came from the long-running Happy Days when the Fonz was water skiing and literally jumped over a shark. He almost took on super powers, it seemed.

I mean it unfortunately came out in 97 and ended in '03 which was really the worst possible time for me. That was going to HS and working full time to save for college and then going to college and working two jobs to avoid debt time.

So when it came out I was vaguely aware of it and some people who's opinions on things like this I still trust absolutely loved it... and some actually hated it. Which to me made it a controversial must see for me... but 97-03 was just not the time.

I didn't get to watch it until life calmed down a bit and that was around '09. And, of course, by then NO ONE wanted to talk about i and everyone had moved on to other shows. So I was left in my own Buffy Bubble and it became a sort of private love affair.

So... what you have here is a television series based on B-Movie tropes that then turns them upside down in a way that you will absolutely love... if you love B-Movies and all their tropes.

The cast is across the board hysterical. It's not really a comedy, but you're going to at least chuckle in every episode.

And the pretty blond ditz that dies in every B horror movie is the kick-butt savior. Which is problematic in 2020 because you aren't supposed to acknowledge that women were ever portrayed as heroic before 2016, and, as a result, any mention of this will get you the N , M, and F word labels by people want to say that they are fighting for equality and thus Buffy doesn't fit in their timelines....

... so even today it's controversial... but this time it is controversial by the people that SHOULD like it... because it was made before 2016 so they don't.

Point being, it is awesome from start to finish... I'm one of the freaks that didn't take any issue with Dawn...and if you have one of the better teachers you are going to learn all about how it forever changed the English language... so there you go, if the title is the reason you don't like it, you got that academia link.

One of the few series that stuck in your head even a week after you've finish them.
Highly recommended. | Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/fO2DgMc97Q8

It's almost hard to believe, but it has been nearly 20 years since _Band of Brothers_ was released on HBO. _Band of Brothers_ is one of those rare examples of near perfection in a television series. In fact it to me this is not really a TV series, it's more like an incredible ten hour movie.

Based on a book of the same name written by Stephen Ambrose, this follows the real life exploits of the men of E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne. We go from their formation and training to their jump into Normandy on D-Day and stay with them right through to Germany's surrender. Over the course of ten episodes we get to know several members of the Company, and experience the horrors and brotherhood of war all the way through.

Apart from the movie level budget, cinematography, visual and make up effects, what makes it so good is that it’s not just a birds eye view of each step of their journey. In each episode we get that wider view but we also get to spend some time with a member of the Company. Whether it’s Bull getting stranded in an occupied village, Doc Roe scrounging for medical supplies in Bastogne, or Lipton narrating an entire episode, each episode brings some sort of variety from the one previous. Likewise not every episode is full of combat, across all of it there is a good balance of personal moments, tension, and all out combat action. Each of those three aspects are skilfully executed too, so the show never gets boring, there aren't any lulls.

I recently watched the movie _Midway_ and in my review of it I said that part of its downfall was trying to do too much by jamming seven months of war into two hours. _Band of Brothers_ is the perfect example of what can be done when there is more time to tell the story. It never feels rushed, it's paced perfectly and its pretty easy to keep track of who's who all the way through.

Speaking of ""who's who"" this has so many “OMG it’s that guy” moments. Given that this was made 20 years ago there are a whole bunch of now-established actors making early forays into their careers, or whom you recognise now for completely different work. Of course there's Damien Lewis and Ron Livingstone front and center, but there's also Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, James McAvoy, David Schwimmer, Simon Pegg, Jimmy Fallon, Colin Hanks, Donnie Wahlberg, and Michael Cudlitz. There are of course many more, and each episode I found myself looking up online to see if that person I spotted was the person I thought it was.

I could go on and on and on about this show. I absolutely love it, it's a masterpiece and may well be my favourite mini-series of all time. Even now, 20 years later this remains a stunning achievement in television history and it is, in my opinion, must see TV. | There are a few haters....and I mean FEW. And mostly they are of the political bend, and lets be honest, people that see politics in everything are going to hate everything.

For the rest of the world it's a really great story, very well done, very well directed, and it's segmented enough and switches focus enough to allow everyone a taste of the different characters while still focusing on the leads.

And of course the reveals the people that the actors are portraying, at the end of the miniseries, is worth all the time you devoted to it. | An amazing series which is incredibly harrowing to watch. Even more so when you consider this is based on real events and real people. This thing will turn you inside out, and it should. An excellent reminder of what so many seem to pay no mind to these days. ""Lest we forget."" | It's the journey of ordinary men who accomplished remarkable successes and left an indelible mark on history. It spans the training period that commenced in 1942 and culminated in the American triumph in World War II. What struck me profoundly was the cinematography, particularly the exquisite quality of the visuals, which allows viewers to experience the intense emotions of soldiers bracing for the next engagement. It brings you amidst the battlefield, with adrenaline and fear coursing through their and your veins. The music and sound effects are so immersive that they evoke a palpable sense of anxiety about the possibility of being shot. The Band of Brothers made significant sacrifices to forge a better world, and although they succeeded in their mission, our generation has likely fallen short in honoring their legacy. The narrative includes minimal references to the political landscape, leaving the viewer uncertain about the moral standings of the opposing sides. However, the primary focus remains on the lives of these heroes and the grim realities of war. It is conceivable that Germans and Americans could have formed lasting friendships absent the influence of their politicians. It is imperative that we do not allow our governments to stray from their intended purposes; it is our responsibility to safeguard our freedom and democracy. It's a must-watch that serves as a poignant reminder that the ""freedom"" we enjoy today was purchased at the cost of countless lives lost due to the folly of political leaders. A tragic lesson that we seem unable to learn.",True

An unusual choice for the hero of an adventure show; in fact her name is Greek for ""the strange woman"".

The show was bizarre for its sheer lack of consistency.

In particular, Kes (the Ocampan) evolves and grants the Voyager crew a 10-year short-cut... (now *only* 55K light-years from Earth).


And then.... | Wow, I mean 75 years away? Stuck in a hostile environment, with a leader like Janeway at the helm?

... well, that is an adventure isn't it?

I mean, I love TNG, I really do... but Voyager should have gotten the movies right. Those would have been a trip to watch.

Farscape meets Star Trek for those of you who have never seen it. Lost in Space meets Star Trek only they know where they are so.... Farscape meets Star Trek.

OK, if you are going to be a Star Trek purest, it isn't as Star Trek as Star Trek can be.... but it is SUPER fun. It is a cool show and the best of the 80s and 90s bunch....

.... maybe behind DS9.... Maybe. | I'm not a Star Trek fan when it comes to TV, but Voyager is the one huge exception. I love this series, even to this very day. I collected them all on VHS, and still own them for posterity, now I have them all on DVD too. Obviously, some episodes are pretty bad, like with any series, but overall it's great. Enjoyable characters, villains and situations. And The Voyager herself rocks!",True

At the heart, it was a show about a relationship, and one marred by the pitfalls of.... living with a super hero. That was a good pitch right there, that added something to the genre that you never really saw before, and Clark was excellent for the role.

He likes to kill human pests and he does it in front of an audience. Now that's entertainment hahahaha. So hang onto your hats kiddies, this one's a real shocker.

Niles Talbot (William Sadler) is a prison executioner that is just a little too good for his job. He works the electric chair. One of his favorite things in life is pulling the switch and watching the life dissipate from his victims. When the state does away with capital punishment and Talbot is let go from his job. He decides to keep the execution game going and hunts down criminals and doling out punishments on his own. 

This is the first ever Tales from the Crypt episode and that makes it pretty interesting. Our main character, Niles Talbot introduces a dark humor to the story when he breaks the fourth wall and conversates with the audience. It's executed really well and it sets the tone for the entire series. | Since Brandon covered episode one, I'll cover episode two!

Plot: A greedy philandering wife (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her second husband (Marshall Bell) for his insurance money. Upon getting rid of the body, she is unexpectedly attacked by a hideous escaped mental patient (Larry Drake) dressed as Santa Claus who has been going around killing women. She soon realizes that her own young daughter is in complete danger from within the horrific situation.

American Horror Story tires to do it, only on a much larger scale with a new story each season that is supposed to be connected in a grandiose way...and that is fine but...

Tales From the Crypt just offered a new and unique story each week, written and directed and acted by some very talented people. Some are science fiction, some were westerns, some were monster stories, some were comedies, but all were exceptionally well crafted.

Part of the draw to it was that missing a week didn't mean you had to catch up at all. And part of it was that, if you didn't like a particular episode you could come back next week and see something entirely different.

Calling a show Quantum Leap, isn't a magic totem,  it doesn't make the show automatically work. 

Such is the case with this ""new"", old series. The original series starring Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell worked in large part, because of the great chemistry and wry humour, these two shared, as much as it was, the shows time travelling adventures.

The reinvention isn't utterly awful but its a long way from being the original.Indeed, aside from the name this show could have been called anything. It bears only a superficial semblance in terms of overriding story.

To my mind, its not helped either by this incessant need, on the part of contemporary entertainment, to push social justice and woke ideologies on the viewing audience. Its not as if we don't notice and speaking for myself and no doubt many others, its tiresome.

There were hilarious moments, and there were serious, heart wrenching moments.
We said goodbye to Henry Blake and hello to Sherman Potter, goodbye to Trapper and hello to BJ, and goodbye (and good riddance) to Frank Burns and hello to Charles Winchester. And we had a definite goodbye to Radar.

But there will always be iconic moments from drinking spirits in ""the swamp"" to Klinger in dresses!

M*A*S*H was a truly fantastic and brilliant sitcom.
Glad I got the whole series on boxset DVD! | This Korean War medical team unit is really two shows.
So, it's rated in two parts.
MASH is sort of four different shows. I've read the book. I've seen the movie, and I've seen the two different formats of the TV show.
The book was much like the first show, where Major Burns is a total scapegoat. There's no way to believe that Hawkeye is a god and Burns is responsible for every terrible thing that ever happened. 
That's the book and the Larry Linville portion of the series. Linville himself knew this was a career ending role, and that the character of Burns was ridiculous.
It did make for funny moments, but the same funny moments that Nazis endorsed when they made Jews their scapegoats.
The first part of MASH is simply an instruction manual for choosing a scapegoat. 
When people watch something like this, they aren't concerned with ""reality"". They're being taught a more. The more being taught isn't to blame the creepy guy for creepy things that he does. That's because no one really knows that much about anyone else.
What is being taught, and the writers and directors of all books and TV shows and movies know this, is the surface view. What is being taught in MASH before Stiers is to just pick a scapegoat. That's all. That's the message.
So, even though the slapstick humor is funny, I give the first era of the TV show a 1/10. It's teaching discrimination and hate without a cause. 
During the first portion, the surgical army unit doctors do perform in a realistic setting, so to speak, and that makes it worse, because it can't be laughed away when they teach people to be modern day Nazis looking for the modern day Jew. Totally worse. 
It's also very dated, because it doesn't take into account the date. Being ""dated"" is misunderstood by ""fan boys"". It doesn't mean what they think. They think it means people from 1952 who act like characters from 1953 are dated. They think a character from 1952 should know about eight track tapes, DVDs, Donald Trump, etc. 
Being ""dated"" actually means that someone from 1952 does know about eight track tapes, DVDs, and Donald Trump. That's ""dated"".
That's the problem with MASH. The ""liberal"" from 1952 would be more like Trapper John. He would be the very far left. Hawkeye would be shot as a traitor, no matter how good of a doctor he claimed he was.
Which is another thing. The MASH book and the Linville era of MASH is like listening to Sinbad tell Hindbad of his voyages. You know he's lying. There's no credibility of character.
Now, the later MASH sees the writers realizing what they've done. Stiers as Winchester is the most credible character of the entire series. This is what a doctor in 1952 would be. Also Honeycutt and Potter. The characters became much more credible, though the humor became drier.
The later part of the series was 9/10. There were still some bits of contrived propaganda, but it was much subtler.
The character of Nurse Hot Lips was worse than that of Burns. She was a worse monster than he was. She had no allegiance at all, and couldn't be trusted. She tried to make underlings nervous in a war zone where being nervous could kill or cripple you, and that cannot be an accident from a major. I kept hoping she would be fragged. There is no way you could trust that monster to be on your side.
The character of Father Mulcahy was also out of touch with the era. He was the epitome of ""dated"", being a 1990 liberal preacher in 1942. As far as credibility goes, he was as bad as Burns.
It was later in the series when the four non coms got more notice. There was always Radar and Klinger, but they were extreme polar opposites. The Rizzo and Igor were added, and they were a bit extreme, even for 1942. Still, they gave more of a balance. Especially Igor, although his character should have been written better, since he was the ""moderate"" enlisted man. As a moderate, for instance, he shouldn't have been from the New York-New Jersey area. That was too contrived to please that area.
The ""scapegoat"" era was so corrupt that it took the rating down for this more than just 1 and 9 equals 10 for an average of 5. Thus, it gets a 4/10 rating.",True

Yes it is Science Fiction, but really it is Social Commentary. | Before Star Wars, this was a fan favorite for sci fi fans alike!

It was campy, cheesy, entertaining, and a little bit pervy!
I mean, C'mon, there were scandidly clad women in the show, even for the 60s! And don't get me started on the Starfleet women's short skirts!
Probably my best highlight of the show! 😅

The writing, directing, and cinematography of Star Trek are top-notch, even by today's standards. On par with more recent series like Battlestar 2004. 

From the top writers and directors of science fiction of that era, sophisticated storylines across the series deal with challenging topics that are risqué even today. Star Trek was radically ahead of its time in the 60’s having a multi-racial main cast including things like non-white character’s and women holding officer positions in Starfleet (unheard of at that time and for decades after)

Warning: Some female characters wear mini-skirts (a fade in the 60’s). Some creatures had campy costumes (state of the art in the 60’s). I would recommend checking out “The Original Series Remastered Project” which has the series remastered at 1080p with updated CGI graphics. | I  think I am required by law to like this the most, right?

He was just brilliant. Spock was just brilliant... and the show was a Star Trek first, it established the franchise, and.... like ALL great science fiction shows, it got canceled too soon.

Then there were some comedies. One in which he purposely made it predictable that a ""dining club"" was eating its members when they got fat enough. The dark comedy was funny because of how oblivious the member was for being the next meal, even though everything pointed to it.

The radio series debuted November 23, 1958.

The television show is presently shown on the Encore-Western channel.

Have Gun – Will Travel was created by Sam Rolfe and Herb Meadow and produced by Frank Pierson, Don Ingalls, Robert Sparks, and Julian Claman.

Richard Boone stars as Palladin, the gunman with a card saying ""Have Gun, Will Travel"".
In the days when this was made, he was seen as a forward thinking liberal gunman, even into the sixties and seventies, and especially today.
It was like most TV series in that all the corrupt people were white males, and especially so in this one. A lot of people today don't realize this, but this was how nearly every Western was in the fifties, even on TV. 
The problem with Palladin was that he never minded his own business, even when he made it his business. He always wanted to play God.
In the show, he's always right, but his philosophy led too much to the modern day ""scapegoating"". | Have Gun, Will Travel offers, in the character of Paladin, a protagonist who was atypical amongst the lineup of 1950's western drama heroes. He was the erudite gunslinger, the gentleman-bounty hunter, the fixer of situations gone bad and a constrained vigilante. Contrary to what has been written in another review, Paladin didn't seek to play ""god""; however, his line of work may have required that he play any of the roles of judge, jury and executioner, depending on the situation. While not pretending to the status of ""god,"" Paladin could quote with ease passages from the King James Bible or Shakespeare, prior to dispatching the villain at hand. It would also be impossible for Paladin to engage in extensive moralizing, as the show made no pretenses about Paladin's choice to be a gun-for-hire to support his lavish lifestyle and other predilections. Contrary to what has been written in another review, villains were not limited to ""corrupt white men,"" and the series made no off-putting political statements of that ilk. Here, the reader should be reminded that 1950's westerns did feature villainous white men, as well as armed conflict with Indians, Mexican banditos and Comancheros. These were the bread and butter of TV western stories but were not political statements in themselves. Paladin was a considerable thinker, but this is not synonymous with ""liberal,"" as has been claimed in another review.

Many shows from the bygone era of 1950's westerns have aged out of appeal. Have Gun, Will Travel hangs on to its viewing enjoyment, primarily through the complex character and commanding presence of Paladin (Richard Boone). All fictional shows require some suspension of disbelief to achieve immersion in the story; for 1950's westerns, this is less of a stretch than for the litany of modern series pertaining to witches, zombies, vampires and CSI-type police dramas.
