Randy, Paula and Simon, iconic names on their own, but even more when you combine them together. Randy Jackson was a music mogul, an individual who played for Mariah Carey, and a legend in his own right. Paula Abdul music icon from the 80s, one of the biggest selling artist and amazing choreographers ever to step foot on a stage. And then Simon Cowell, the ruthless, aggressive and honest individual that America fell in love with. And has went on to become one of the Biggest Music executive directors in the world.

I’m going to captivate all seasons in this one review, so this is going to be a long one, so enjoy. 

Season one, what an incredible journey, a show that you did not think was going to last let alone become such a mega hit that it became. But more importantly, you had to have the right winner. With America voting did we get the right winner? America selected the quiet yet powerful vocals of Kelly Clarkson. Kelly Clarkson went on to solidify the show as a mega superpower. When she became a Grammy award-winning artist, television actress, movie actress, and she is now has a syndicated talk show. Kelly Clarkson went on to sell millions of albums, worldwide and even placed, second place in Idol against all the other idol competitions around the world.

Season two was the biggest controversial season we saw to date trying to follow up with the success of the first season, we awarded Ruben Studdard, the winner of American idol with a bunch of controversy, whether or not Clay Aiken should’ve been the one to go onto the show. Either way, both men came out of the successful and not only did the two men come out successful. Kimberly called well became in Household, hosting and becoming an actress.

Season three delivered Fantasia Barrino, one of the most underrated incredible voices in the world. Her voice is so unique and iconic. She went onto also become a Grammy award winner and best selling R&B artist. She also stemmed Jennifer Hudson and Oscar winning and Grammy winning artist as well from that season who plays seventh place. This showed American idol was not just focused on the winner, but the people from the top 12 also had an opportunity to become super successful. From the season alone we also got Deanna Degarmo who went to become a Broadway legend.. 

Season four, we got the greatest and legendary country singer in Carrie Underwood. She brought the fire and tore that season apart. She was a young lady who did not know anything and never had been on a plane. To go on and become a multi time, Grammy award winning artist and mega power, and now she sits at the table as one of the judges for American idol. 

Season five became the new controversy, after season two and season three brought us severe controversy season five hit us even harder. Taylor Hicks took home the title of American Idol during this season, and ended up failing as a credible winner. Not being able to hold up to the four before him. All four artists before him either are Grammy winners or Grammy nominated artist. Taylor could not live up to those expectations and standards. His fourth finisher Chris Daughtry went to be a Grammy award-winning rockstar. Which is the person everyone thought was going to win this show. Catherine McVie became an actress and Elliott Yamin pulled out a great singing career as well. we also got the Grammy award winning Christian artist Mandisa, and we got country artist of Bucky Covington and country superstar Kellie Pickler. Season five may have had the wrong winner, but it had the most incredible group of top 12. 

Season six, we got NFL football players, daughter Jordon Sparks as the winner youngest winner at that time. She went on to become also a Grammy nominated artist, keeping the trend alive that success can come from the show. We also got the boxing talents of Blake Lewis, and a few other individuals who stemmed from the show, but didn’t make it to the superstardom level.

Season seven we started to the show out with one of the most incredible finale battles. We’ve seen in a long time David versus David , two different individuals. One rocker and one gospel singer. The older David, David Cook came out on top as he prevailed the rocker of the season. He went on to sell multiple albums, but still never reached the stardom of five of his predecessors. He still had a very successful career, but it was never a megastar career.

During our season, eight journey, American idol decided to spice things up by adding a fourth judge. Kara Diaguardi and she brought a lot of controversy between Simon and herself. After seven years of being the three they are now the four. Kris Allen captured the title of season eight, with one of the most controversial wins of all time. Front runner and expected winner. Adam Lambert went on to become a star in his own right, but was believed to be the actual winner of the show. But America was not ready for an LGBT winner. Especially someone who was completely open about their sexuality. Now American Idol served a little differently than it normally did you may have got a few people to have minor success after the show. But by this time, if you weren’t the winner, you barely got any success afterwards and that didn’t even mean if you got success. Unfortunately, he may have won the competition but he did just as bad as the previous winner from season five.

We move onto season nine still with the same set of judges, Lee Dewyze wins the title in the most forgettable, unsuccessful, and unpopular season ever. America was not fond of the singer, songwriter, crooner season, that transpired from dispatch. The only thing we got from this was gospel singer Colton Dixon, which to be honest with you, he might’ve actually came from a different season, they also attempted to spice things up just a little more, by replacing longtime judge Paula Abdul with Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen did not work out, she hated everything about judging people, and quit the show immediately after.

Season 10, we return to a three judges panel. With Ellen DeGeneres quitting and American idol not renewing Kara‘s contract, and then Simon Cowell exiting the show. We were left up in the air with the judges panel. They brought on Steven Tyler from Aerosmith and Latin legend, Jennifer Lopez. This season saw the winner of Scotty McCreery, who went on to become a country superstar, but not only that he also was the first in a long time where the runner-up went on to be a country superstar in Lauren Alaina. America and American idol were back on top.

We moved into season 11 with the same judges Randy, Jennifer,Steven and what a group they turned out to be, funny and hilarious and great judges. We saw the coronation of Philip Phillips, who went on to have one of the greatest singles of all time. And even had it as the Olympics theme song for that year. Philip had struggled afterwards to captivate and connect with the audience. Which put him in the same boat as Taylor, David, Kris and Lee. But the American Idol team was helpful.

We moved on to season 12 this season saw the departure of Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez as judges. And brought in Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey. Unfortunately, for this season, Nikki and Mariah could not get along. The fighting, the continued arguments and bantering back-and-forth, took away from the contestants, and took away from their singing, and what the competition in the show was all about, and it turned into a dramatic all out mess. This season we got the winner of Candice Glover, who went on to do nothing, she became one of those forgotten winners, and one of the most failed American Idol winner of all time at this moment. She did release an album, but it failed on the charts. And it was because I believe the focus was off of these individuals and more on the dramatics of the judges. So nobody grew to love them like you did the previous winners.

So we went on to season 14 of American Idol. At this time, American Idol did not invite Nick or Mariah back, and Randy Jackson decided to part ways. The company brought back Jennifer Lopez to join Keith Urban and then brought on Harry Connick Junior, these three became the saving Grace of at least the judges panel. But it was too late for the show. The show kept these judges for the next three seasons. This season we saw the winner Caleb Johnson who took Candice‘s spot as the worst American Idol winner of all time. His failed rocker vibe and music did not captivate or grab anyone’s attention. His album flocked American idol continue to go.

Season 14, we got the winner of NickFradiani personally he is one of my favorite winners, because his music is incredible and underrated. But to the general public, he didn’t sell as bad as the other two but he’s definitely in the bottom five. He did continue to go on to perform in local venues and push forward the best he could. But now it was a stain on the American idol winners, and I believe it stems from that toxic judges panel.

We moved onto season 15, the end of American idol. They brought back the winners and some fan favorites, had a huge celebration for all the years the show was on there. The judges all came back and everybody celebrated. As the winner, Trent Harmon took on the final title of American idol. And even though, it is the end, it did not give him the push. He thought he was going to get. And he once again with the American idol winners became a failed champion.

American idol stayed gone for over a year, and the general public did miss the show, so Walt Disney purchases the show and brings it back with a more positive and energetic flare. They brought it back with the worst voting system, date. The judges had more power than America, so they got to choose majority of who they’re putting in, when America is the one that should be choosing because we are the ones that buy the albums. I said since day one, this was going to be a failure, if they do not change it back to single elimination instead of group elimination. But American idol decided it was going to do its own thing and push on.

Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan became the new judges of American Idol season 16 through 22

I’m gonna combine the seasons together for the most part, but I’m going to still give them their due and their credibility. Season 16 we saw the winner of Maddie Poppee who also was the wrong winner, because Gabby Barrett who worked third place in the show went on to be a country superstar and was the front runner the entire time. We finally got some thing from one of those shows, but it wasn’t the winner. Unfortunately, the winner went on to be a failed winner again.

Season 17 we saw Laine Hardy someone from previous season come back and capture the title. The Elvis look-alike young country megastar was going to be born, but American idol sat on his album debut, and sat on his music. To the point lane, then became a failed winner and gotten legal trouble, he’s making a return today as we speak. But it may be too late for the young country artist. 

Season 18 the pandemic season, the season that took place with everybody filming from their living room or their bedrooms. We watched as American idol still tried to keep this show relevant with everybody submitting their videos, the judges were on zoom, the contestants were on zoom and we continued to watch this show as just Sam, a young woman with financial issues captured the title. She had a beautiful voice and an incredible presence for someone who was never on the stage. Yet, American Idol dropped the ball with her completely, and she became the worst winner of all time. 
 
We moved onto season 19 when Chayce Beckham, captured the title, he went on to also be a failed winner and not successful in the world of music. He did have one song that slowly climb the charts, but never quite got anywhere. He was brought back many times on the show, but that was the only time you seen or heard of him. Yet, just Sam was still left off the show. And never took the stage.

Season 20 we got the winner of Noah Thompson, the wrong winner of American idol hands-down no questions asked. He captured the title of the show because he was extremely attractive. There was no way that America actually voted him in as the best singer, except they chose him based on his looks. And where did it get us another failed winner American idol is tarnished, I don’t see the show producing a mega star ever again. We have went through so much and yet we’ve gotten nowhere. 
 
But American idol continue to push forward with season 21, that’s when America finally saw firsthand. We claimed wrong winners in the past, but this was hands-down the wrong winner. Iam Tongi American idol’s first Hawaiian winner, went on to accomplish nothing. No music, no album and definitely no concerts. He was awarded the win on this show simply because of the passing of his parent, there is no way that this man beat half of the people that he was going up against. Unfortunately, the winners are final and they claim America’s vote. But this is the first time I questioned 100% whether or not, the show was rigged. They think they were going to get success from this person, no, they are not thinking, marketing wise, American idol went for a sympathetic run instead.

Season 22 another controversy strikes American Idol as Katy Perry the judge is called out for bullying a woman for having a baby and sex under age. Even though that is not what happened, we’re in a world of cancel culture. We’re in a world where people blow up social media and change things. So this will be the last season for Katie Perry as a judge. we went on to Crown the winner of Abi Carter, American idol, normally by this time has pushed their artist to be close to having an album, to get music out there and to captivate the world. But we have yet to see anything or hear anything from this young lady and it just looks like we’re gonna follow the same train of another failed winner.

Season 23 Carrie Underwood American idol. All they need is one mega star to come forward to reconnect the crowd and the audience and build up the history of these legendary winners from the past. Because we have not seen a single successful winner since season 10 and before season six. American Idol has more failed winners than they do champions.","Jennifer Lopez, Ryan Seacrest, Keith Urban, Harry Connick Jr.",1.0,True,8.0,2002.0

**Spoiler for S01E01:**

The characters are extremely shallow, always trotting out the same spiels and back story. They will all talk endlessly about how traumatised they are about the death of their mother decades earlier without a single mention of their other dead family member who died on the show and is seemingly never mentioned again.
***

Ultimately the whole show feels like a badly written soap opera, obscenely implausible scenarios occuring on a ranch with a body count in the hundreds. The characters become caricatures of themselves, dialogue and character development is shallow with the plot falling apart with even the slightest thought. | **Cheesy and bad writing**

“**Spoilers may be inside**”

The first episode starts with a socking scene, followed by good acting and beautiful views of Montana. Soon many characters are introduced and their complex dynamics start to shape in. So far so good.

By the episode 5-6 onwards the show starts to lose its grip. No consistency in behavior, illogical violence, unnecessary screaming/cursing, followed by some lazy cowboy scene, and this becomes monotonous. The writing is so poor, e.g. someone kills somebody, and the next morning he is enjoying some cowboy moments, as if nothing happened. No fear, no remorse, nothing.

The whole show becomes pretty repetitive and cheesy. I am surprised it got 8+.","Luke Grimes, Kelly Reilly, Wes Bentley, Cole Hauser, Kelsey Asbille",0.0,False,0.0,2018.0

I find long running series like this one annoying, in so much as they largely, shore up establishment narratives, rather than exposing them, for what they are.

Acting is reasonable but feels a little forced and unrealistic, at times. Its not helped by rather predictably, formulaic characterisations.

We think it went down the wrong path and ruined the show for us. Go through season 5 and then just read the endings of the next seasons on some blog or something and forget about watching it. This will make your memories of the show stay great. Trust me, don't watch those final seasons. | One of my favorite TV series of all-time, possibly one of the best ever made for a time. The acting, writing, and plot are all so well-done and unique. The only problem is the unreasonable expectations from the first seasons make people hyper-critical of the latter ones. In my opinion, the only ""bad"" season was 8, and a lot of that has to do with the manner in which the writers end the story (no real finality).

Full review here: https://godhatesgeeks.com/invincible-episodes-1-3-review-gore-heavy-superhero-perfection/ | What can be said about _Invincible_?  I know!  ""_The Boys_, it ain't.""  
What does that mean?  It means for this series, unlike like the comic book it's patterned after, is lacking in...backbone.  
I find this series detestable in its lameness.  It's lopsided high swearing ratio to a negative degree of gratuity is the essence of overstepping resulting in underachieving.  It's just like that other Netflix series _Vox Machina_.  The animation series seems like it excessively swears in order to try and overshadow its lack of tits & ass...excitement!  Which is a real shame because that means it's falling under the umbrella of DEI/ESG and represent-tay-shone!  Those cancerous influences on entertainment that just keep on deteriorating any hope of garnishing fans, attracting followers, or achieving some sort of agency.  
No one is looking for this series because there is nothing engaging about it, i.e., there is nothing to hold the male gaze.  We can get our fix of violence playing video games.  If we want to hear swearing, then we can call up those same friends we play online with.  That leaves gratuity (tits & ass).  And since DEI, ESG, and representation hold ""respect of gender, skin color, and sexual orientation in such high regard"" as not to offend anyone, THEN that means there is nothing of interest or going to be anything of interest to engage one's want to view said lameness that is this series.  
Those BS statuettes of wokeness rob and will continue to rob entertainment of anything remotely engaging, anticipatory, or (God forbid) inspiring.  It's just one drama after another and that equates boring, boring, BORRRRRINNGGGG!!!! 
I watched the entire 2nd season, and I can honestly say I felt for this season just like I did for the first.  Nothing.  Not a damn thing.  I don't care if there is a 3rd season or when that season will begin, play or end.  It just doesn't, as a straight adult male, do anything for me.  In fact, if you think this series is woke, you haven't read the comic for comparison. The comic is only slightly better, but not by much. 
If you can stomach bland entertainment, then go for it.  If you have anything else you could be doing or watching, I say do that!!  It will infinitely more productive than vegging out to this shite series.

I stopped watching after Season 1 as I was devastated lol kinda. Only 2015 I decided to continue watching and got addicted like it seemed complicated at first, too many stories and characters. I even used a guide from internet like family tree per house while watching or GOT wiki so I can have more background on the characters. For a TV series, this show can really take you to a different world and never knowing what will happen. It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe). I have never read the books but the show is entertaining and you will really root for your faves and really hate on those you hate. 

Fantasy, action, drama, comedy, love...and lots of surprises! | Cruel, bloody, vulgar, Machiavellian, unrepentant. And that is just the writing. The camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery. 

And all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting I've ever seen. From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery. | LOTR meets House of Cards. Imagine a fantasy novel if all of the beasts and mythologies were transported to the real world. There's no such thing as a happy ending, or an ending for that matter (unless you're dead). So as you watch the show make predictions, draw conspiracy theories, and watch them blow up in your face. This show is that kind of a ride! | This series starts off like some of the best out there. Although it makes some minor adjustments, it follows the story from the books quite faithfully for the first 4 seasons. And adds a twinkle of big budget movies, and great cinematography. Truly awesome. Up until this point, I was in love with the series, a 10/10. I quickly read all the books, and re-watched all seasons before a new one would come out.

However, from season 5 and onwards, it starts going downhill. They ran out of book-material, and it shows. Everything starts focusing on the big set-pieces, characters become extremely bland and predictable. From here all major characters receive plot-armor, which was one of the things it didn't have before, and that made it interesting to watch. Of course they want you to think that they will still kill some of the main characters, but they're just teasing.

The last few seasons I've only been watching to see what the conclusion to this story is, but I cringe and writhe during every episode I watch. What a pitiful way to go out. Hopefully the books finish the story in a more interesting and believable way. | Before watching this TV show I was told that it's best TV show ever. I'm big fan of Vikings TV series and when I asked opinion about GOT to my friend, he said Vikings is nothing compared to GOT. All my coworkers are GOT addicts, so finally I gave it a try. I watched all 8 seasons, so I'm quite qualified to review it: It wasn't bad TV show. Actually it was quite good with interesting characters, but it wasn't as good as I was told and I personally don't agree on that statement that it's better than Vikings. Most interesting parts where around queen Daenerys. This TV show gets tense after season 7, however things don't go like we wanted and ending is awfully bad. Basically, this TV show is ruined by stupidly bad ending which leaves you quite upset. In short, GOT is good TV show (not great), ruined by bad ending. | I admit that I never saw the whole series. That said, on January last year I decided to binge watch all of it.
First 10 minutes of the first episode left me in awe and as I kept watching I finally understood why everybody loved it.
Each episode left me in shock and awe. From shocking character deaths to epic battle scenes. Some of the characters I loved, while a few I hated and glad they finally died.

Series 8, as I've finally catched up. I was honestly left disappointed with the ending - and I'd hoped they would save the Nightwalker battle for the last two episodes. Nevertheless, this series was a decent way to end the franchise.

Your watch has ended. | I decided to give this a try due to all of the acclaim it received. I smile when I remember seeing a review for another great show that had a higher rating than Game of Thrones, and the reviewer said that the other show was a good show but he gave it just one star because he couldn’t believe it was ranked higher than GOT. I thought, I guess I need to watch this Thrones show that has such rabid devotees.

I expected a sort of Lord of the Rings on steroids, but I don’t know what drug it is on. The settings and characters are realistic, and the Machiavellian plot lines seems to make sense to me for a while.  As the series went on, however, my interest began to flag a bit. Some of the characters that seemed complex at the outset, devolved into predictable two-dimensional stereotypes. And my stars, the number of rapes going on. I recognize that in such society rape was probably commonplace, but it was likely so in Ancient Rome also, and yet the great series Rome found other ways to titillate than the one-trick pony of forced entry.

So I confess I didn’t make it to the end of the show, but from what I hear, even big fans of the show were let down by how it all wound down. | **The Greatest Story Ever Filmed**

It's nothing new that HBO always have the most ambitious projects around, but from 2011 to 2019 they gradually built what I consider the epitome of quality television, and made history. The highly talented show-runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss took the unadaptable giant books by George R. R. Martin and transformed them into this beautifully constructed show, that something of it's kind was never done before. There are so many layers to this story, so many characters and story arcs intertwining with each other that it seems impossible to grasp one man came up with it all.

The story Martin created is probably one of the better and most detailed and well-crafted stories of all times, and David and Dan's transformation of the story to the TV medium was beautifully handled. There aren't that many shows when you sit and watch an episode and savor every single scene, if it's the content itself or the many small details that were precisely designed for every frame you watch. It takes a little time to get into the show in the beginning, just because it's very different from what we are generally used to. It's one of those shows that from the very first episode until the last it's just one big story so you just need patience to get used to everything that's going on in there, and after that enjoyment is guaranteed. Above all, the thing the show benefited perhaps the most of is the fact that ever since the day they started writing the first script- the complete story from start to finish was compiled in George's head. Not all the details and specifics of course, but the outline and major plot points were invented years ago when he started working on this huge book series, therefore the production knew exactly where to start, where the story is heading and where it ends, which gave consistency to the story from episode 1 to 73, without getting lost in the way with loose threads.

The show gets plenty of criticism for its deviations from the source material season 5 and onwards, but if you just think for a second how enormous this story is it's pretty easy to realize a lot needed to be altered to fit the TV medium, and David and Dan managed to do so while preserving the original essence of Martin's creation, keep the story well constructed and coherent and keep dozens of millions of viewers satisfied, and not only a handful of hard core followers that wanted it to be a page- to-page adaption of the novels. While I enjoyed all the books and didn't agree with a few of the changes they made for the show as well I can see why a lot had to be cut, things don't work the same in books as in television. Considering they knew the ending from the start and the huge amount of details you have to alter just from omitting one storyline if you want to reach the same final goal as the books, I believe it was overall for the best and they knew what they were doing, the story didn't collapse under their hands- at least as far as I'm concerned.

One of the most prominent aspects of this show in my opinion is Ramin Djawadi's masterful score which must be one of the most brilliantly unique works ever for a series (whether it's a series of movies or TV series) not only because of the compositions themselves, which are exceptionally beautiful, but also for how the music evolves throughout the seasons and builds the world of the show hand to hand with the writing, the characters and the setting as the story progresses. Also, the way each motif of the music identifies with a certain aspect of the story, though mostly noticeable in later seasons, tells a complete story on its own. Never seen anything like it.

All these wordy descriptions couldn't however describe the experience of watching this show live as it aired. The thrill, the off-season anticipation and continuous speculations, the satisfaction of watching a new amazing episode after waiting for so long, the 8-years-long water-cooler talks and the overall influence GoT had on pop culture in the time it was on TV- I'm sure many of us will always remember how it felt, and I'm not sure if we'll get to experience something like that anytime soon. I already watched each season several times, probably more than any other show or movie, and I never get tired of any of it, if it's the well constructed dialogues or blood pumping action sequences. I definitely see myself still constantly revisiting seasons every once in a while from now until further notice.

I think the success of the show speaks for itself- the countless awards, high acclaim from casual viewers and critics alike, the major fan following, it's influences on the television landscape and on culture in general- it's a winner in all fronts. In my personal opinion it's the greatest television series ever made, but generally speaking I think it's safe to say this show is for the ages and I think it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest cinematic works ever produced. Even almost 2 years after the show ended, it still remains one of the most popular and in-demand shows in the world, which I find pretty amazing. I just hope the uproar on social media will calm down eventually so we can once again all enjoy this show together. People tend to use this word too cheaply these days, but I wouldn't say Game of Thrones is anything short of a masterpiece. | Simply the best, except last season. | Starts out exciting and engaging with complicated and likable characters leading the way for the viewer. Lots of sex, lots of nudity, plenty of dragons and magic and gory battles. But as the story goes on, most of the likable characters die off or become emasculated, so you're oddly left rooting for those who were once the loathsome the antagonists to put the ""good chicks,"" whoever they are, out of their misery. From season 3-ish the series takes a wild turn stray of the original book series, the fault of the creator who couldn't keep up with the writing. Did it turn out for the better in the series, or not? That's up for the viewer to decide, that is, if one cares about the leftover matriarchy enough to find out. No spoilers, but the end seemed to leave fans of the series rather underwhelmed. | Well, two thumbs up for the nudity, that holds my interests...honestly. I'm not ashamed to say it.

And the acting was good.

But I have a problem with fantasy. World building, world building, world building, world building, and that is coupled with gibberish, gibberish, gibberish, and, by the time it gets around to the thick, juicy, meat of the plot...it lost me.

I really don't care about the world building, I'd rather jump right in to the plot and not deal with the nonsense. Oh, they have wolves that aren't exactly wolves... I don't care. They have dragons, that's cool but... too much time was spent about why they are so rare and... I don't care, they have dragons, they are rare, just stop the world building and go back to the murder and intrigue.

I honestly preferred Rome, Deadwood, the Sopranos, all the other shows that didn't have to sacrifice so much to world building. | **Game of Thrones: A Cinematic Masterpiece**

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Game of Thrones stands tall as a cinematic marvel, blending intricate storytelling, complex characters, and jaw-dropping visuals. With its epic scale and unpredictable twists, it has rightfully earned its place at the top of my must-watch list.

⚔️👑 #GameofThrones #EpicTV | **A series so massive and absorbing that it seems small on television.**

What can we say about a television series that everyone has said everything about and that, over almost a decade, has collected almost every award it could win? Nothing special. Only that he fully deserved all the awards and public esteem he acquired. Each season deserved, in itself, its own review, but I feel that there is no point in adding more than this small text about the overall work done. Almost everyone has seen the series, and the praise is known to everyone.

The numbers behind this series are overwhelming. With each episode costing millions of dollars to make, a luxurious cast and a script so complex that it requires the public's full attention, we are faced with a work that seems worthy of the cinema and is better than many large-production films we have already seen. . The story told is based on the epic fantasy books written by George R. R. Martin, who actively collaborated on the series and is one of those most responsible for the script, heavily inspired by loose pieces of medieval European history. About this, it is necessary to understand one thing: despite the inspirations and violence and rivalries that were in fact common in medieval times, at no point does the series try to be a portrait of medieval Europe, it is absolutely fiction and should be seen that way : For example, the series pays some attention to heraldry and the genealogy of noble families, but very few heraldic shields were made according to the simpler rules of true heraldry.

The production and visual effects of the series are one of its strong points: the episodes are so good and impactful that it is difficult to imagine how anything better could be done. All the technology used is state of the art today, and no savings were made in the resources made available to creators. Filming took place across Europe, from Ireland to Spain, passing through Morocco, England and Croatia, taking advantage of the best of locations that, in themselves, are entirely worth a visit for any tourist. The sets could not have been designed with greater attention to detail, and the same can be said of the luxurious costumes for the main cast and thousands of extras. The photography, the filming, the editing, everything was thought out on a large scale. The soundtrack, based on the main song and some other magnificent melodies, is one of the best I've ever seen on a television program.

The actors are immense throughout the eight seasons, and we can hardly say anything negative about any of them. We may disagree with the choices in the script, with the way the characters were developed, but the actors were completely up to these challenges and managed them wonderfully. We can also criticize, with some fairness, the graphic brutality of certain scenes, the excessive nudity and the abuse of the sex scenes. This is the negative criticism with which I tend to agree most easily, not least because I don't see anything in these scenes that would be indispensable to the plot in most cases (I would highlight, as one of the exceptions, Cersei's nudity during her punishing walk through the streets of King's Landing).

On a positive note, I would highlight the impeccable effort of Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster Waldau, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Alfie Allen, Isaac Hempstead Wright and Rory McCann. Not only did they play incredibly well, they gave their characters the dramatic and psychological evolution they needed. It is also fair to congratulate Sean Bean, Kit Harington, John Bradley, Conleth Hill, Aidan Gillen, Carice van Houten, Charles Dance, Natalie Dormer and Jack Gleeson, who had much more stable and fixed characters in their hands. Some were more cliché (the case of crazy King Joffrey), but each actor deserves praise. | HBO's sprawling fantasy epic, Game of Thrones (2011), isn't for the faint of heart. It plunges viewers into the harsh, mysterious world of Westeros, a land steeped in ancient traditions and brutal power struggles. What truly elevates the series, however, is its ability to leverage this captivating setting to explore complex, often disturbing, facets of humanity.

The series excels at world-building. Westeros feels tangible, its vast landscapes and intricate political machinations drawing you in. There's a constant sense of unease, a feeling that something dark lurks beneath the surface. This unsettling atmosphere is masterfully used as a backdrop to explore very real, contemporary issues – the lust for power, the devastating consequences of war, and the depths of human cruelty.

Be prepared, however, for characters who are rarely one-dimensional heroes or villains. Game of Thrones thrives on moral ambiguity. You'll encounter characters who are capable of immense kindness and horrific acts in equal measure. This can be a harsh and even disgusting reality to grapple with, but it's a testament to the show's writing and acting that it can evoke such strong emotions. You'll find yourself feeling deeply invested in the characters' fates, celebrating their victories and mourning their losses.

The emotional rollercoaster is a defining aspect of Game of Thrones. It's a series that demands your full attention, rewarding viewers who stay the course with an unforgettable journey filled with heart-pounding battles, shocking twists, and moments of genuine beauty. While the later seasons may not have lived up to the sky-high expectations set by the early installments, the overall experience remains undeniably gripping.

In conclusion, Game of Thrones is a landmark television achievement. With its rich setting, unflinching portrayal of human nature, and ability to evoke a wide range of emotions, it's a series that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Just be prepared for a wild ride, filled with both exhilarating highs and soul-crushing lows.","Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke",1.0,True,59.0,2011.0

One to enjoy with a beer or two and some chips. 8/10 from me. | I think it's athe best serial in past 5 years. I recommend it | 1st 6 maybe 5 seasons is all u need to watch!, after that no originality!! | # **15 Years of Saving People, Hunting Things: The Supernatural Phenomenon**

## **Why Supernatural Endured for 15 Seasons**

Fifteen seasons. Over 300 episodes. That’s not just a show—it’s a legacy. *Supernatural* wasn’t just about monster hunts or witty one-liners (though it had plenty of those). It was about two brothers, their iconic Chevy Impala, and the kind of storytelling that digs deep, pulls at your heart, and keeps you hooked until the very end.

At its core, *Supernatural* was a masterclass in blending horror, humor, and raw emotion. It’s no surprise the *SPN Family*remains as passionate as ever—because this show wasn’t just something you watched, it was something you *felt*. Whether the Winchester brothers were fighting demons or angels, it was always about their bond. That’s the heartbeat of *Supernatural*.

So what made *Supernatural* stand out? From the unforgettable chemistry between Sam and Dean to the perfect mix of epic mythology and iconic episodes, *Supernatural* earned its place as one of TV’s greatest—and even after 15 seasons, we still can’t stop talking about it.

---

## **Sam and Dean: The Unbreakable Bond at Supernatural’s Core**

At the center of *Supernatural* is one undeniable truth: this show is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean Winchester. Sure, they’ve battled everything from shape-shifters to archangels, but the real fight has always been for each other. Their bond goes beyond just being brothers—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and that deep, unspoken connection that keeps them pushing forward no matter the cost.

Sam and Dean aren’t just characters—they’ve become a blueprint for what makes a dynamic duo truly great. Dean, with his tough-as-nails exterior and unshakeable devotion, and Sam, the thoughtful, conflicted younger brother trying to balance family duty with his own desires, are the emotional heartbeat of the series. Together, they aren’t just fighting monsters—they’re fighting fate, destiny, and everything in between.

What makes their relationship so powerful is the constant tug-of-war between their deep love for one another and the weight of the sacrifices they make. Each of them has literally gone to Hell and back for the other, and these moments of sacrifice hit hard because they feel real. It’s the kind of relationship that sticks with you long after the credits roll. No matter how intense the monster hunts get, it’s always the quieter, more intimate moments between Sam and Dean that resonate the most.

The Winchester brothers are the reason we keep coming back. Their chemistry is electric, their struggles are relatable, and their bond is unbreakable. At the end of the day, *Supernatural* isn’t just about saving the world—it’s about saving each other, and that’s what makes it special.

## **A Perfect Blend: Horror, Comedy, Drama, and Heart**

*Supernatural* is a masterclass in genre-blending. This show doesn’t just play in one sandbox—it takes over the entire playground. Horror? Check. Comedy? Absolutely. Drama? You bet. And somehow, it manages to weave all of these elements together without missing a beat.

Let’s start with the horror. We’re talking everything from classic ghost hunts to full-on battles with demons and angels. The scares are real, but *Supernatural* never leans too hard into the gloom. Just when you’re clutching your blanket, Dean drops a snarky one-liner or Castiel gives you that wonderfully deadpan confusion, and suddenly you’re laughing. It’s this perfect pivot between tension and humor that keeps the show fresh and—dare I say it—fun.

But here’s where *Supernatural* really nails it: the heart. Beneath all the monster slaying and apocalyptic drama, this is a show about family and sacrifice. Every episode, no matter how wild the plot gets, is anchored by Sam and Dean’s relationship. They’ll literally go to Hell (and back) for each other, and the emotional depth that brings is what turns a good show into a great one.

The genius of *Supernatural* is that it never lets one genre overpower the others. It’s as comfortable delivering gut-punching emotional moments as it is making you jump out of your seat or burst out laughing. And that balance? That’s why fans keep coming back—because with *Supernatural*, you’re getting the best of every world.

## **The *Supernatural* Mythology: From Urban Legends to Apocalyptic Battles**

If you thought *Supernatural* was just about hunting ghosts and taking down demons, think again. This show goes all-in when it comes to mythology—pulling from urban legends, religious lore, and just about every spooky story you’ve ever heard whispered around a campfire. It’s like a folklore buffet, and *Supernatural* serves it up hot.

The early seasons keep it tight with classic monster-of-the-week vibes: wendigos, shapeshifters, cursed mirrors—you name it, Sam and Dean have faced it. But here’s where the show really flexes its creative muscles. As it grows, so does the mythology, until we’re no longer just talking about salt lines and silver bullets. Suddenly, we’re dealing with fallen angels, biblical prophecies, and—oh yeah—Lucifer himself. This isn’t your average horror show; this is epic, universe-spanning storytelling.

*Supernatural* does what few other shows manage—it constantly raises the stakes without collapsing under the weight of its own lore. It takes bold swings. One season, you’re dealing with a local haunting, the next, you’re questioning the very nature of free will and destiny as Sam and Dean go toe-to-toe with God. Yeah, it gets that big. But no matter how grand the mythology gets, the story never forgets where it started—on the road, in that Impala, with two brothers just trying to survive.

The genius lies in the balance. The show dances between grounded urban legends and sweeping, cosmic battles, and somehow, it all works. The lore isn’t just background noise either—it’s integral to the emotional weight of the series. Every demon exorcised, every angelic encounter adds layers to Sam and Dean’s journey, and by the end, you’re not just watching a TV show—you’re knee-deep in a modern myth.

## **Character Growth and Evolution: From Hunters to Heroes**

Let’s get one thing straight—*Supernatural* wouldn’t be the powerhouse it is without its incredible character work. Sure, the monsters, demons, and angels are fun, but it’s the characters that keep us coming back. Over 15 seasons, these aren’t just hunters—they’re heroes, villains, and everything in between, evolving in ways that make them feel real and raw.

We’ve got Sam and Dean, obviously, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. *Supernatural* thrives because it fills its world with characters who are as complex as they are iconic, whether they’re wielding a blade, throwing a sarcastic quip, or breaking your heart in ways you didn’t see coming.

### **The Winchester Brothers: Heart of the Show**

Let’s start where it all began: Sam and Dean. These two aren’t just brothers—they’re the emotional core of the entire series. From episode one, it’s clear their bond is what makes this show different. Sure, they fight demons and battle the apocalypse on a regular basis, but at the end of the day, *Supernatural* is a story about family.

Dean, the hardened, tough-love protector, grows from a cocky hunter into a deeply vulnerable character, grappling with self-worth and purpose. His bravado might be the surface, but underneath is a man who’d throw himself into Hell (literally) for the people he loves. Dean is a walking paradox: a man who craves love but feels he doesn’t deserve it. By the end, his arc feels like an emotional marathon—you’ve seen him win, lose, and keep fighting even when all hope is gone.

And then there’s Sam. The younger Winchester brother starts out wanting nothing to do with the hunter life, but as the series progresses, we watch him become the moral compass, even when that means making brutal sacrifices. He wrestles with dark powers, addiction, and self-doubt, but somehow, Sam always finds his way back to the fight. His journey from idealistic college kid to seasoned hero with a complicated past makes him one of the most dynamic characters on TV.

### **Bobby Singer: The Reluctant Mentor Turned Father Figure**

Bobby Singer didn’t just help Sam and Dean fight monsters—he taught them how to survive in a world where evil was as constant as the rising sun. From the moment Bobby entered their lives, he wasn’t just another hunter in the background; he became the mentor they needed after losing their father. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural and his no-nonsense approach to hunting, Bobby became the man the brothers could turn to when things got rough, a guiding voice when John Winchester’s strict code of survival wasn’t enough.

What made Bobby stand out was that he wasn’t a stereotypical mentor. He was gruff, stubborn, and unapologetically real. But beneath that tough exterior, Bobby had a heart of gold—and a deep, almost paternal love for Sam and Dean. He didn’t just teach them how to fight; he taught them how to think. Bobby wasn’t afraid to call the boys out on their mistakes, pushing them to be better hunters, better brothers, and better men.

And let’s not forget his intellectual prowess. Bobby was the go-to source for lore, rituals, and all things supernatural. When Sam and Dean were stumped, Bobby had the answers, usually found buried in one of his many old, dusty books. His combination of intellect and heart made him indispensable to the Winchester’s journey.

More than anything, Bobby’s presence grounded Sam and Dean. He was their anchor, the one person who wasn’t afraid to show them tough love while also being the emotional support they so desperately needed. He wasn’t just a hunter or a friend—he was family, shaping the brothers into the heroes they would ultimately become

### **Castiel: The Angel Who Fell (In More Ways Than One)**

Now, let’s talk about *Castiel*, the angel who became so much more than just a celestial being. Castiel starts out as a soldier of Heaven, but his journey quickly takes him down a more human path. He learns about loyalty, sacrifice, and love—not from the angels above, but from Sam and Dean.

Castiel’s evolution is one of the most emotionally satisfying parts of the series. His deadpan humor and awkward attempts to understand human behavior give the show some of its best comedic moments, but it’s his growing humanity that really tugs at the heartstrings. He transforms from a rigid, obedient angel to a fiercely loyal friend, even when it means defying Heaven’s orders. By the end, Castiel isn’t just an angel—he’s family. His ultimate sacrifice, fueled by love, is one of the show’s most heartbreaking and powerful moments, cementing his place as a fan favorite.

### **Crowley: The Demon with a Heart (Maybe)**

Now, enter *Crowley*, the self-proclaimed “King of Hell” who somehow becomes one of the most beloved characters in the show. Crowley isn’t your typical villain—he’s equal parts sinister and hilarious, wielding sarcasm like a weapon. He dances in the grey area between good and evil, forming uneasy alliances with Sam and Dean that blur the lines of morality. Crowley’s evolution is wild: from ruthless demon to someone who shows flashes of loyalty and, dare I say, compassion. He’s the bad guy you hate to love, but can’t stop rooting for. The man makes deals with souls, but still manages to feel like a necessary part of the Winchester family.

### **Lucifer: The Devil in the Details**

And speaking of villains—let’s not forget *Lucifer*. You’d expect the Devil to be all fire and brimstone, but *Supernatural*gives us a version of him that’s sharp-tongued, manipulative, and, oddly enough, a little charismatic. He’s the ultimate Big Bad, but Lucifer’s complexity goes deeper than just being evil incarnate. He’s a character who feels betrayed, cast aside by his own father (God), and, as twisted as it sounds, you almost *get* him. Almost. Lucifer is unpredictable in the best way—one minute, he’s terrifying, and the next, he’s delivering one of the funniest lines in the show. That’s the beauty of *Supernatural*—even the most sinister characters have layers.

### **Rowena: Witch with Ambition**

Let’s talk about *Rowena*. If you thought Crowley was complicated, his mother takes it to another level. Rowena starts out as a cunning, ruthless witch who’s only out for herself. But over time, she evolves into something much more intriguing—a fiercely independent character who eventually shows depth beyond her manipulative facade. Rowena’s growth from power-hungry villain to someone capable of sacrifice gives us one of the richest character arcs in the series. Plus, her sharp tongue and witty one-liners make every scene she’s in a delight. Rowena is the kind of character who proves that even the baddest of witches can change—if only on her own terms.

### **Charlie Bradbury: The Nerdy Hero We Needed**

Charlie Bradbury was the fandom’s heart, the geek girl who jumped into the Winchester world and held her own. A brilliant hacker turned hunter, she brought an infectious energy to the series. Charlie was quirky, brave, and endlessly resourceful. Her relationship with Sam and Dean evolved into something like family—proving that not all bonds in *Supernatural* are forged in blood. Charlie represented the fan in all of us, geeking out over LARPing one minute and slaying monsters the next. Her tragic end hit hard because we saw so much of ourselves in her—a reminder that in *Supernatural*, no one is safe, not even the ones who make us smile the most

*Supernatural*’s genius lies in its characters—each one layered, each one evolving in unexpected ways. Whether it’s Dean battling inner demons, Sam wrestling with impossible choices, or Crowley and Rowena walking the tightrope between villain and ally, every character brings something vital to the table. It’s the humanity behind these larger-than-life figures that makes *Supernatural* more than just a show about monsters—it’s a show about people, family, and the impossible lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.

## **The Classic Rock Soundtrack and Baby: The Heart and Soul of *Supernatural***

Let’s get one thing straight—*Supernatural* wouldn’t be *Supernatural* without its [killer classic rock soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7jbyn1EOcBopLl6SXISNYx?si=ZVoIA0FNTd2Q79YWRyXU4A&pi=u-okiyK605QK6L) and the Impala, better known as “Baby.” These aren’t just fun add-ons; they’re core characters in the show’s DNA. Dean’s love for classic rock and his dedication to Baby go beyond fandom quirks—they’re extensions of who he is, and by extension, what the show is all about.

First, the music. You hear the opening chords of Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” and suddenly, you’re not just watching a show—you’re stepping into an epic, fifteen-season journey. It’s the unofficial anthem of the Winchesters, and it hits with emotional weight every time it plays. But it doesn’t stop there. *Supernatural* treats classic rock like a gospel, with Dean as its faithful preacher. Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bob Seger—it’s all there. Whether it’s “Back in Black” roaring through an Impala montage or the bittersweet notes of Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” during one of those rare reflective moments, the music has always been the show’s soul.

And let’s not forget “Night Moves.” When Dean and Sam share a rare, carefree moment belting out Bob Seger’s iconic track in the car, it’s not just two brothers passing time—it’s a reminder that even in the middle of hunting monsters and fighting the apocalypse, they’re still human. They still *feel*. These songs aren’t just background noise—they’re emotional markers that tell the story as much as the dialogue does.

This soundtrack does more than fill silence—it gives the show its heartbeat. Dean rolling down the highway to “Back in Black” feels like a declaration. This isn’t just a random playlist; it’s a soundtrack with soul. And for the fans who grew up with these songs, it’s a nostalgic goldmine, bringing together the thrill of adventure and the comfort of familiarity in every riff and guitar solo. Whether it’s Rush’s “Working Man” pounding through an action-packed scene or “Renegade” by Styx building up to one of the show’s more tense moments, the music elevates the storytelling every single time.

Now, let’s talk about Baby—the *other* constant in Sam and Dean’s lives. This 1967 Chevy Impala isn’t just a car; she’s a Winchester in her own right. Baby is as much a part of the show as any character. She’s been through every monster hunt, every road trip, and every heartbreak. Dean’s love for her is more than just the pride of owning a classic car—Baby is home. She’s where the brothers retreat when the world gets too heavy, where they talk out their next move or sit in quiet, reflective moments while the radio hums with classic rock.

And then there’s the legendary episode “Baby,” where we get an entire story told from her perspective. It’s genius because it shows us what we’ve always known—Baby isn’t just a backdrop, she’s *central* to the Winchesters’ lives. Every dent, scratch, and repair tells a story. She’s carried them through battles with demons, angels, and even Death itself, and yet, no matter how bad things get, Baby keeps on rolling.

The best moments in *Supernatural* often come when the Impala tears down the road, music blaring, and you realize it’s more than just a scene—it’s the embodiment of freedom. When Bob Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” plays during quieter moments, it adds depth to the boys’ story. These aren’t just two guys saving the world—they’re two guys who’ve lost, who’ve sacrificed, and who still get back in that car and keep driving.

And let’s not forget how integral these two elements—music and Baby—are to the fans. Every time we hear “Carry On Wayward Son” or see the Impala glide through a night-lit highway, it brings us back to the heart of *Supernatural*: family, loyalty, and the idea that no matter how bad things get, you don’t stop fighting. The music and Baby are reminders that the Winchesters always keep moving forward. The music gives the show its pulse, and Baby? She gives it its heart.

Together, Baby and the soundtrack represent more than just cool cars and great music—they symbolize the unbreakable bond between the brothers and the freedom of life on the road. Dean’s devotion to Baby is about more than metal and wheels—it’s about roots, history, and the one constant in a life filled with chaos. And the classic rock soundtrack? It’s the spirit of *Supernatural*, carrying us through every battle, every tear, and every victory.

So yeah, Baby might just be a car and the music might just be a bunch of rock tracks, but in *Supernatural*, they’re everything. Together, they make the Winchesters’ journey more than just a fight against evil—they make it a road trip you never want to end.

## **The Balance Between Monster-of-the-Week, Epic Mythology, and Meta Episodes**

If *Supernatural* had stuck to just one formula, it wouldn’t have lasted 15 seasons. What makes this show work so brilliantly is its ability to walk the line between gripping standalone episodes (the infamous “monster-of-the-week” format), sprawling multi-season myth arcs, and bold, fourth-wall-breaking meta episodes that drag you deeper into the *Supernatural* universe with a wink and a smirk. This is a balancing act most shows can’t pull off—but *Supernatural*makes it look effortless.

The *monster-of-the-week* episodes are where the show leans into its roots. These are the stories that feel like urban legends brought to life: Wendigos, shapeshifters, Bloody Mary—all the creatures you grew up fearing—*Supernatural*served them up with eerie intensity. These episodes kept the show grounded, reminding us that no matter how high the stakes got, at its heart, it was about two brothers solving mysteries in the dark.

But then, *Supernatural* did something even smarter—it built a mythos that stretched far beyond the usual ghost story. As the series unfolded, it cracked open a bigger mythology, introducing demons, angels, Lucifer, and eventually, God Himself. And it wasn’t just expanding the stakes—it was creating an entire universe. That seamless switch from local hauntings to biblical showdowns is what gives the series its epic scale. The transition from “what’s that creepy thing in the dark?” to “oh, we’re fighting the actual apocalypse now” shouldn’t have worked this well. But somehow, it did.

Then came the secret weapon: *Supernatural*’s ability to laugh at itself. The show broke the fourth wall like no other, delivering *meta* episodes that poked fun at its own genre, fandom, and even its actors. These episodes weren’t just gimmicks—they were masterclasses in self-awareness, using humor to not only keep the audience entertained but also to highlight the show’s versatility. Episodes like “The French Mistake,” where Sam and Dean are tossed into an alternate universe where they’re actors in a TV show called *Supernatural*, are the perfect blend of absurdity and cleverness. You’ve got the Winchesters trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki poke fun at their real lives. It’s a ridiculous concept, but it works—and it’s just one example of how the show seamlessly merged its deep, emotional storytelling with moments of pure comedic genius.

But it didn’t stop there. Whether it was “Changing Channels,” which hilariously transported Sam and Dean through various TV show genres (hello, sitcom laugh track), or “Fan Fiction,” which took meta to a whole new level by turning the spotlight on the *Supernatural* fandom, these episodes dared to break the rules of traditional TV. And yet, even while poking fun at itself, the show never lost sight of its core themes: family, destiny, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.

These *meta* episodes gave the show room to breathe between the high-stakes mythology arcs and the creature-hunting adventures, allowing for moments of levity and creativity that kept fans hooked. One week, you’re watching Sam and Dean battle a vengeful spirit, and the next, they’re trapped in a fake version of their own lives or hilariously battling their way through TV parodies. And the best part? It never felt out of place. *Supernatural* had built such a flexible, layered world that even the most outlandish episodes fit into its broader narrative.

The show’s humor and willingness to poke fun at its own genre only strengthened its bond with fans. We weren’t just watching two brothers take on the apocalypse; we were in on the joke, laughing along as the writers playfully deconstructed the show’s own tropes. The fourth-wall-breaking episodes added a new dimension to the series, proving that *Supernatural* wasn’t afraid to take risks, mock itself, or fully embrace the weird.

Whether you’re watching an emotional myth arc about Heaven and Hell, a spooky creature-of-the-week, or a meta episode that leaves you laughing out loud, *Supernatural* mastered the art of keeping its audience on their toes. One moment you’re on the edge of your seat, the next you’re in stitches—but no matter what, you’re invested. That’s the magic of this show: the perfect balance of humor, horror, and heart.

## **Family and Sacrifice: The Heartbeat of *Supernatural***

“Saving people, hunting things—the family business.” It’s more than a catchphrase. For the Winchesters, it’s a creed. Right from the first episode, *Supernatural* drives home the fact that the Winchester family isn’t like most others. They don’t sit down for Sunday dinners or swap happy holiday stories. Their legacy is blood-soaked, hard-earned, and filled with impossible choices. For Sam and Dean, family isn’t just about genetics—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and the willingness to walk into hell (sometimes literally) to save the people you love.

But *Supernatural* doesn’t stop at biological bonds. While the show’s emotional center is Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection, it constantly reminds us that family is about more than blood. From Bobby Singer to Castiel, Charlie Bradbury to Jodie Mills, the Winchesters build a found family around them, one forged in battle and trust.

Bobby isn’t just the grizzled hunter who helps from the sidelines. He’s the father figure the brothers desperately needed after losing their own. And when Bobby sacrifices everything to protect Sam and Dean, it’s not out of duty—it’s love. His gruff “idjits” is always laced with affection, making his inevitable departure one of the series’ most heartbreaking moments. For Bobby, family meant being willing to give everything, even when there was nothing left to give.

Then there’s Castiel. The angel who started off as Heaven’s loyal soldier quickly became something far more complex—a brother in arms, a friend, and ultimately, family. Castiel’s arc is one of the most poignant examples of *Supernatural*‘s exploration of loyalty. His decision to fall from grace, to fight alongside the Winchesters instead of against them, represents the power of chosen family. Castiel’s ultimate sacrifice for Dean—driven by love, not duty—solidifies his place as a Winchester, proving that sometimes, the strongest family ties aren’t the ones we’re born with, but the ones we create.

And who could forget the fierce women of *Supernatural*? Charlie Bradbury might not have been born into the hunter life, but she earned her place through loyalty and guts. As a geeky, fearless hacker turned badass hunter, Charlie shows us that family can be chosen. Her bond with the Winchesters ran deep, and her tragic end still stings because she wasn’t just a friend—she was family. Jodie Mills, on the other hand, stepped into the role of protector, becoming a mother figure to a new generation of hunters. She didn’t have to take these lost girls under her wing, but she did because, in *Supernatural*, family is about showing up when no one else will.

Time and time again, *Supernatural* shows us that family means sacrifice. The Winchesters ask themselves the hard question: how far would you go for the people you love? And the answer is always: further than you think. Whether it’s Dean making deals with demons to save Sam, or Sam risking his life to pull Dean from the brink, their story is one of selflessness—sometimes to a fault.

And that’s where the real beauty of the show lies. It’s not just about hunting monsters or saving the world. It’s about the people you’re willing to stand beside in the fight. It’s about the love, loyalty, and sacrifice that define the Winchester legacy. Because in *Supernatural*, family isn’t just a bond—it’s a battle. And even when the stakes are cosmic, it always comes down to saving people and hunting things, because that’s the family business.

## **The Fandom That Kept It Alive: The Power of the SPN Family**

When we talk about *Supernatural*’s unprecedented 15-season run, there’s one undeniable force that carried the show through every twist, turn, and apocalyptic showdown: the *SPN Family*. It’s more than just a fanbase—this community of devoted viewers, creators, and passionate advocates became the backbone of *Supernatural*, driving its success and influencing the way fandoms interact with television today. From launching fan campaigns to attending conventions, the *SPN Family* didn’t just support the show—they helped shape it.

What makes *Supernatural* unique is how it built this loyal, worldwide following, despite starting off as an under-the-radar series on The WB (remember that network?). Back in 2005, *Supernatural* premiered to modest ratings, with no guarantee it would survive past its first season. The show might have flown under the radar of the mainstream critics, but the fans? They saw something special.

It wasn’t long before the *SPN Family* transformed into a cultural powerhouse, keeping *Supernatural* alive through low ratings, network shifts, and even a writer’s strike. While some shows rely solely on their storylines or cast to stay afloat, *Supernatural* had something extra: a fanbase that wasn’t afraid to fight for it. These weren’t casual viewers tuning in once a week—they were engaged, connected, and fiercely loyal.

Fan conventions were one of the biggest drivers behind this loyalty. Year after year, conventions like *Creation Entertainment’s Salute to Supernatural* became pilgrimage spots for fans to meet their favorite cast members, share their art, theories, and stories, and celebrate their love for the show. For many, these events were more than just photo-ops or autograph sessions—they were community-building hubs. Here, fans bonded over their shared love of all things Winchester, forming friendships and creating memories that transcended the screen.

But what truly sets the *SPN Family* apart is its activism. The fans didn’t just watch and engage—they gave back. From charity drives inspired by the cast to campaigns like *Random Acts* (founded by Misha Collins, the actor behind Castiel), the *SPN Family* showed that they were willing to take their love for the show and channel it into positive real-world change. It’s this deeper level of engagement that sets them apart from your average fandom.

And here’s the thing—the *Supernatural* team *knew* how much the fandom mattered. They weren’t just passive observers—they embraced the *SPN Family*, making them a part of the narrative. Episodes like “Fan Fiction” and “The Monster at the End of This Book” celebrated the fans in a way no other series had done before, blending real-life fandom with the fictional world of the Winchesters. In the meta episodes, the show didn’t just break the fourth wall—it leaned into it, acknowledging fan fiction, fan theories, and even shipping (Dean/Cas, anyone?) with a wink and a nod.

More than once, the *SPN Family* made the impossible happen. After all, it was fan dedication that helped push *Supernatural* into its 15th season, a feat almost unheard of in genre television. And when the show finally aired its last episode, the fandom didn’t just disappear. The community, built over 15 years of love, continues to thrive through fan projects, conventions, and online spaces dedicated to keeping the *Supernatural* spirit alive.

In an age where shows often live and die by network decisions or fluctuating ratings, *Supernatural* proved that the voice of the fans could be louder than any number crunching in a studio boardroom. The *SPN Family* wasn’t just a group of people who liked a show—they were the fuel that kept the engine running, year after year, apocalypse after apocalypse.

So, while the Winchesters may have closed the final chapter of their story, the *SPN Family* ensures that the legacy of *Supernatural* lives on. It’s a testament to the power of community, proving that when fans truly care, they can keep a story alive well beyond its final credits.

## **The Legacy of *Supernatural***

When the curtains finally closed on *Supernatural* after a monumental 15-season run, it was clear the show had left behind more than just a string of successful episodes. It had built a universe, a community, and a legacy that reshaped how genre TV could be experienced. What started as a story about two brothers hunting monsters morphed into a saga that dived deep into mythology, human emotion, and, most importantly, the concept of family—both by blood and by choice.

The show’s impact isn’t just measured by its episode count or ratings—it’s about the lives it touched. For many fans, *Supernatural* became more than just a weekly watch; it was a constant through the ups and downs of their lives. The show’s exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what’s right, even when it’s hard, resonated deeply. It gave viewers more than just entertainment—it offered comfort and a sense of belonging.

And let’s not forget the way *Supernatural* evolved the landscape of TV storytelling. It mixed procedural elements with an ongoing mythology in a way that allowed it to flex between epic apocalyptic plots and intimate character-driven moments. It embraced a *meta* sense of humor that blurred the line between fiction and reality, giving fans episodes that felt like inside jokes shared by a family—fitting for a show that always came back to the theme of familial bonds.

As for the cast, they weren’t just characters on a screen. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and the rest became household names, in no small part due to the accessibility and warmth they showed to their fans. It’s rare for a cast to engage so fully with their audience, and that, perhaps, is *Supernatural*’s real magic. The sense of community fostered between the creators, cast, and audience is something most shows can only dream of achieving. It’s why, even after the final episode aired, the *SPN Family* continues to thrive.

At its core, *Supernatural* was about more than just hunting monsters or saving the world. It was about connection—the connection between characters, the connection between the show and its audience, and the connections it fostered between fans around the globe. For 15 years, *Supernatural* wasn’t just a show; it was a phenomenon. And in that time, it proved one truth above all else: that family doesn’t end in blood | **15 Years of Saving People, Hunting Things: The Supernatural Phenomenon**

**Why Supernatural Endured for 15 Seasons**
Fifteen seasons. Over 300 episodes. That’s not just a show—it’s a legacy. _Supernatural_ wasn’t just about monster hunts or witty one-liners (though it had plenty of those). It was about two brothers, their iconic Chevy Impala, and the kind of storytelling that digs deep, pulls at your heart, and keeps you hooked until the very end.

At its core, _Supernatural_ was a masterclass in blending horror, humor, and raw emotion. It’s no surprise the SPN Family remains as passionate as ever—because this show wasn’t just something you watched, it was something you felt. Whether the Winchester brothers were fighting demons or angels, it was always about their bond. That’s the heartbeat of _Supernatural_.

So what made _Supernatural_ stand out? From the unforgettable chemistry between Sam and Dean to the perfect mix of epic mythology and iconic episodes, _Supernatural_ earned its place as one of TV’s greatest—and even after 15 seasons, we still can’t stop talking about it.

**Sam and Dean: The Unbreakable Bond at Supernatural’s Core**
At the center of _Supernatural_ is one undeniable truth: this show is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean Winchester. Sure, they’ve battled everything from shape-shifters to archangels, but the real fight has always been for each other. Their bond goes beyond just being brothers—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and that deep, unspoken connection that keeps them pushing forward no matter the cost.

Sam and Dean aren’t just characters—they’ve become a blueprint for what makes a dynamic duo truly great. Dean, with his tough-as-nails exterior and unshakeable devotion, and Sam, the thoughtful, conflicted younger brother trying to balance family duty with his own desires, are the emotional heartbeat of the series. Together, they aren’t just fighting monsters—they’re fighting fate, destiny, and everything in between.

What makes their relationship so powerful is the constant tug-of-war between their deep love for one another and the weight of the sacrifices they make. Each of them has literally gone to Hell and back for the other, and these moments of sacrifice hit hard because they feel real. It’s the kind of relationship that sticks with you long after the credits roll. No matter how intense the monster hunts get, it’s always the quieter, more intimate moments between Sam and Dean that resonate the most.

The Winchester brothers are the reason we keep coming back. Their chemistry is electric, their struggles are relatable, and their bond is unbreakable. At the end of the day, _Supernatural_ isn’t just about saving the world—it’s about saving each other, and that’s what makes it special.

**A Perfect Blend: Horror, Comedy, Drama, and Heart**
_Supernatural_ is a masterclass in genre-blending. This show doesn’t just play in one sandbox—it takes over the entire playground. Horror? Check. Comedy? Absolutely. Drama? You bet. And somehow, it manages to weave all of these elements together without missing a beat.

Let’s start with the horror. We’re talking everything from classic ghost hunts to full-on battles with demons and angels. The scares are real, but _Supernatural_ never leans too hard into the gloom. Just when you’re clutching your blanket, Dean drops a snarky one-liner or Castiel gives you that wonderfully deadpan confusion, and suddenly you’re laughing. It’s this perfect pivot between tension and humor that keeps the show fresh and—dare I say it—fun.

But here’s where _Supernatural_ really nails it: the heart. Beneath all the monster slaying and apocalyptic drama, this is a show about family and sacrifice. Every episode, no matter how wild the plot gets, is anchored by Sam and Dean’s relationship. They’ll literally go to Hell (and back) for each other, and the emotional depth that brings is what turns a good show into a great one.

The genius of _Supernatural_ is that it never lets one genre overpower the others. It’s as comfortable delivering gut-punching emotional moments as it is making you jump out of your seat or burst out laughing. And that balance? That’s why fans keep coming back—because with _Supernatural_, you’re getting the best of every world.

**The Supernatural Mythology: From Urban Legends to Apocalyptic Battles**
If you thought _Supernatural_ was just about hunting ghosts and taking down demons, think again. This show goes all-in when it comes to mythology—pulling from urban legends, religious lore, and just about every spooky story you’ve ever heard whispered around a campfire. It’s like a folklore buffet, and _Supernatural_ serves it up hot.

The early seasons keep it tight with classic monster-of-the-week vibes: wendigos, shapeshifters, cursed mirrors—you name it, Sam and Dean have faced it. But here’s where the show really flexes its creative muscles. As it grows, so does the mythology, until we’re no longer just talking about salt lines and silver bullets. Suddenly, we’re dealing with fallen angels, biblical prophecies, and—oh yeah—Lucifer himself. This isn’t your average horror show; this is epic, universe-spanning storytelling.

_Supernatural_ does what few other shows manage—it constantly raises the stakes without collapsing under the weight of its own lore. It takes bold swings. One season, you’re dealing with a local haunting, the next, you’re questioning the very nature of free will and destiny as Sam and Dean go toe-to-toe with God. Yeah, it gets that big. But no matter how grand the mythology gets, the story never forgets where it started—on the road, in that Impala, with two brothers just trying to survive.

The genius lies in the balance. The show dances between grounded urban legends and sweeping, cosmic battles, and somehow, it all works. The lore isn’t just background noise either—it’s integral to the emotional weight of the series. Every demon exorcised, every angelic encounter adds layers to Sam and Dean’s journey, and by the end, you’re not just watching a TV show—you’re knee-deep in a modern myth.

**Character Growth and Evolution: From Hunters to Heroes**
Let’s get one thing straight—_Supernatural_ wouldn’t be the powerhouse it is without its incredible character work. Sure, the monsters, demons, and angels are fun, but it’s the characters that keep us coming back. Over 15 seasons, these aren’t just hunters—they’re heroes, villains, and everything in between, evolving in ways that make them feel real and raw.

We’ve got Sam and Dean, obviously, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. _Supernatural_ thrives because it fills its world with characters who are as complex as they are iconic, whether they’re wielding a blade, throwing a sarcastic quip, or breaking your heart in ways you didn’t see coming.

**The Winchester Brothers: Heart of the Show**
Let’s start where it all began: Sam and Dean. These two aren’t just brothers—they’re the emotional core of the entire series. From episode one, it’s clear their bond is what makes this show different. Sure, they fight demons and battle the apocalypse on a regular basis, but at the end of the day, Supernatural is a story about family.

Dean, the hardened, tough-love protector, grows from a cocky hunter into a deeply vulnerable character, grappling with self-worth and purpose. His bravado might be the surface, but underneath is a man who’d throw himself into Hell (literally) for the people he loves. Dean is a walking paradox: a man who craves love but feels he doesn’t deserve it. By the end, his arc feels like an emotional marathon—you’ve seen him win, lose, and keep fighting even when all hope is gone.

And then there’s Sam. The younger Winchester brother starts out wanting nothing to do with the hunter life, but as the series progresses, we watch him become the moral compass, even when that means making brutal sacrifices. He wrestles with dark powers, addiction, and self-doubt, but somehow, Sam always finds his way back to the fight. His journey from idealistic college kid to seasoned hero with a complicated past makes him one of the most dynamic characters on TV.

**Bobby Singer: The Reluctant Mentor Turned Father Figure**
Bobby Singer didn’t just help Sam and Dean fight monsters—he taught them how to survive in a world where evil was as constant as the rising sun. From the moment Bobby entered their lives, he wasn’t just another hunter in the background; he became the mentor they needed after losing their father. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural and his no-nonsense approach to hunting, Bobby became the man the brothers could turn to when things got rough, a guiding voice when John Winchester’s strict code of survival wasn’t enough.

What made Bobby stand out was that he wasn’t a stereotypical mentor. He was gruff, stubborn, and unapologetically real. But beneath that tough exterior, Bobby had a heart of gold—and a deep, almost paternal love for Sam and Dean. He didn’t just teach them how to fight; he taught them how to think. Bobby wasn’t afraid to call the boys out on their mistakes, pushing them to be better hunters, better brothers, and better men.

And let’s not forget his intellectual prowess. Bobby was the go-to source for lore, rituals, and all things supernatural. When Sam and Dean were stumped, Bobby had the answers, usually found buried in one of his many old, dusty books. His combination of intellect and heart made him indispensable to the Winchester’s journey.

More than anything, Bobby’s presence grounded Sam and Dean. He was their anchor, the one person who wasn’t afraid to show them tough love while also being the emotional support they so desperately needed. He wasn’t just a hunter or a friend—he was family, shaping the brothers into the heroes they would ultimately become.

**Castiel: The Angel Who Fell (In More Ways Than One)**
Now, let’s talk about _Castiel_, the angel who became so much more than just a celestial being. Castiel starts out as a soldier of Heaven, but his journey quickly takes him down a more human path. He learns about loyalty, sacrifice, and love—not from the angels above, but from Sam and Dean.

Castiel’s evolution is one of the most emotionally satisfying parts of the series. His deadpan humor and awkward attempts to understand human behavior give the show some of its best comedic moments, but it’s his growing humanity that really tugs at the heartstrings. He transforms from a rigid, obedient angel to a fiercely loyal friend, even when it means defying Heaven’s orders. By the end, Castiel isn’t just an angel—he’s family. His ultimate sacrifice, fueled by love, is one of the show’s most heartbreaking and powerful moments, cementing his place as a fan favorite.

**Crowley: The Demon with a Heart (Maybe)**
Now, enter _Crowley_, the self-proclaimed “King of Hell” who somehow becomes one of the most beloved characters in the show. Crowley isn’t your typical villain—he’s equal parts sinister and hilarious, wielding sarcasm like a weapon. He dances in the grey area between good and evil, forming uneasy alliances with Sam and Dean that blur the lines of morality. Crowley’s evolution is wild: from ruthless demon to someone who shows flashes of loyalty and, dare I say, compassion. He’s the bad guy you hate to love, but can’t stop rooting for. The man makes deals with souls, but still manages to feel like a necessary part of the Winchester family.

**Lucifer: The Devil in the Details**
And speaking of villains—let’s not forget _Lucifer_. You’d expect the Devil to be all fire and brimstone, but Supernatural gives us a version of him that’s sharp-tongued, manipulative, and, oddly enough, a little charismatic. He’s the ultimate Big Bad, but Lucifer’s complexity goes deeper than just being evil incarnate. He’s a character who feels betrayed, cast aside by his own father (God), and, as twisted as it sounds, you almost get him. Almost. Lucifer is unpredictable in the best way—one minute, he’s terrifying, and the next, he’s delivering one of the funniest lines in the show. That’s the beauty of _Supernatural_—even the most sinister characters have layers.

**Rowena: Witch with Ambition**
Let’s talk about _Rowena_. If you thought Crowley was complicated, his mother takes it to another level. Rowena starts out as a cunning, ruthless witch who’s only out for herself. But over time, she evolves into something much more intriguing—a fiercely independent character who eventually shows depth beyond her manipulative facade. Rowena’s growth from power-hungry villain to someone capable of sacrifice gives us one of the richest character arcs in the series. Plus, her sharp tongue and witty one-liners make every scene she’s in a delight. Rowena is the kind of character who proves that even the baddest of witches can change—if only on her own terms.

**Charlie Bradbury: The Nerdy Hero We Needed**
_Charlie Bradbury_ was the fandom’s heart, the geek girl who jumped into the Winchester world and held her own. A brilliant hacker turned hunter, she brought an infectious energy to the series. Charlie was quirky, brave, and endlessly resourceful. Her relationship with Sam and Dean evolved into something like family—proving that not all bonds in _Supernatural_ are forged in blood. Charlie represented the fan in all of us, geeking out over LARPing one minute and slaying monsters the next. Her tragic end hit hard because we saw so much of ourselves in her—a reminder that in Supernatural, no one is safe, not even the ones who make us smile the most.

_Supernatural’s_ genius lies in its characters—each one layered, each one evolving in unexpected ways. Whether it’s Dean battling inner demons, Sam wrestling with impossible choices, or Crowley and Rowena walking the tightrope between villain and ally, every character brings something vital to the table. It’s the humanity behind these larger-than-life figures that makes _Supernatural_ more than just a show about monsters—it’s a show about people, family, and the impossible lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.

**The Classic Rock Soundtrack and Baby: The Heart and Soul of Supernatural**
Let’s get one thing straight—_Supernatural_ wouldn’t be _Supernatural_ without its killer classic rock soundtrack and the Impala, better known as “Baby.” These aren’t just fun add-ons; they’re core characters in the show’s DNA. Dean’s love for classic rock and his dedication to Baby go beyond fandom quirks—they’re extensions of who he is, and by extension, what the show is all about.

First, the music. You hear the opening chords of Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” and suddenly, you’re not just watching a show—you’re stepping into an epic, fifteen-season journey. It’s the unofficial anthem of the Winchesters, and it hits with emotional weight every time it plays. But it doesn’t stop there. Supernatural treats classic rock like a gospel, with Dean as its faithful preacher. Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bob Seger—it’s all there. Whether it’s “Back in Black” roaring through an Impala montage or the bittersweet notes of Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” during one of those rare reflective moments, the music has always been the show’s soul.

And let’s not forget “Night Moves.” When Dean and Sam share a rare, carefree moment belting out Bob Seger’s iconic track in the car, it’s not just two brothers passing time—it’s a reminder that even in the middle of hunting monsters and fighting the apocalypse, they’re still human. They still feel. These songs aren’t just background noise—they’re emotional markers that tell the story as much as the dialogue does.

This soundtrack does more than fill silence—it gives the show its heartbeat. Dean rolling down the highway to “Back in Black” feels like a declaration. This isn’t just a random playlist; it’s a soundtrack with soul. And for the fans who grew up with these songs, it’s a nostalgic goldmine, bringing together the thrill of adventure and the comfort of familiarity in every riff and guitar solo. Whether it’s Rush’s “Working Man” pounding through an action-packed scene or “Renegade” by Styx building up to one of the show’s more tense moments, the music elevates the storytelling every single time.

Now, let’s talk about _Baby_—the other constant in Sam and Dean’s lives. This 1967 Chevy Impala isn’t just a car; she’s a Winchester in her own right. Baby is as much a part of the show as any character. She’s been through every monster hunt, every road trip, and every heartbreak. Dean’s love for her is more than just the pride of owning a classic car—Baby is home. She’s where the brothers retreat when the world gets too heavy, where they talk out their next move or sit in quiet, reflective moments while the radio hums with classic rock.

And then there’s the legendary episode “Baby,” where we get an entire story told from her perspective. It’s genius because it shows us what we’ve always known—Baby isn’t just a backdrop, she’s _central_ to the Winchesters’ lives. Every dent, scratch, and repair tells a story. She’s carried them through battles with demons, angels, and even Death itself, and yet, no matter how bad things get, Baby keeps on rolling.

The best moments in _Supernatural_ often come when the Impala tears down the road, music blaring, and you realize it’s more than just a scene—it’s the embodiment of freedom. When Bob Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” plays during quieter moments, it adds depth to the boys’ story. These aren’t just two guys saving the world—they’re two guys who’ve lost, who’ve sacrificed, and who still get back in that car and keep driving.

And let’s not forget how integral these two elements—music and Baby—are to the fans. Every time we hear “Carry On Wayward Son” or see the Impala glide through a night-lit highway, it brings us back to the heart of _Supernatural_: family, loyalty, and the idea that no matter how bad things get, you don’t stop fighting. The music and Baby are reminders that the Winchesters always keep moving forward. The music gives the show its pulse, and Baby? She gives it its heart.

Together, Baby and the soundtrack represent more than just cool cars and great music—they symbolize the unbreakable bond between the brothers and the freedom of life on the road. Dean’s devotion to Baby is about more than metal and wheels—it’s about roots, history, and the one constant in a life filled with chaos. And the classic rock soundtrack? It’s the spirit of _Supernatural_, carrying us through every battle, every tear, and every victory.

So yeah, Baby might just be a car and the music might just be a bunch of rock tracks, but in _Supernatural_, they’re everything. Together, they make the Winchesters’ journey more than just a fight against evil—they make it a road trip you never want to end.

**The Balance Between Monster-of-the-Week, Epic Mythology, and Meta Episodes**
If _Supernatural_ had stuck to just one formula, it wouldn’t have lasted 15 seasons. What makes this show work so brilliantly is its ability to walk the line between gripping standalone episodes (the infamous “monster-of-the-week” format), sprawling multi-season myth arcs, and bold, fourth-wall-breaking meta episodes that drag you deeper into the _Supernatural_ universe with a wink and a smirk. This is a balancing act most shows can’t pull off—but _Supernatural_ makes it look effortless.

The monster-of-the-week episodes are where the show leans into its roots. These are the stories that feel like urban legends brought to life: Wendigos, shapeshifters, Bloody Mary—all the creatures you grew up fearing—_Supernatural_ served them up with eerie intensity. These episodes kept the show grounded, reminding us that no matter how high the stakes got, at its heart, it was about two brothers solving mysteries in the dark.

But then, _Supernatural_ did something even smarter—it built a mythos that stretched far beyond the usual ghost story. As the series unfolded, it cracked open a bigger mythology, introducing demons, angels, Lucifer, and eventually, God Himself. And it wasn’t just expanding the stakes—it was creating an entire universe. That seamless switch from local hauntings to biblical showdowns is what gives the series its epic scale. The transition from “what’s that creepy thing in the dark?” to “oh, we’re fighting the actual apocalypse now” shouldn’t have worked this well. But somehow, it did.

Then came the secret weapon: _Supernatural’s_ ability to laugh at itself. The show broke the fourth wall like no other, delivering meta episodes that poked fun at its own genre, fandom, and even its actors. These episodes weren’t just gimmicks—they were masterclasses in self-awareness, using humor to not only keep the audience entertained but also to highlight the show’s versatility. Episodes like “The French Mistake,” where Sam and Dean are tossed into an alternate universe where they’re actors in a TV show called _Supernatural_, are the perfect blend of absurdity and cleverness. You’ve got the Winchesters trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki poke fun at their real lives. It’s a ridiculous concept, but it works—and it’s just one example of how the show seamlessly merged its deep, emotional storytelling with moments of pure comedic genius.

But it didn’t stop there. Whether it was “Changing Channels,” which hilariously transported Sam and Dean through various TV show genres (hello, sitcom laugh track), or “Fan Fiction,” which took meta to a whole new level by turning the spotlight on the _Supernatural_ fandom, these episodes dared to break the rules of traditional TV. And yet, even while poking fun at itself, the show never lost sight of its core themes: family, destiny, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.

These meta episodes gave the show room to breathe between the high-stakes mythology arcs and the creature-hunting adventures, allowing for moments of levity and creativity that kept fans hooked. One week, you’re watching Sam and Dean battle a vengeful spirit, and the next, they’re trapped in a fake version of their own lives or hilariously battling their way through TV parodies. And the best part? It never felt out of place. _Supernatural_ had built such a flexible, layered world that even the most outlandish episodes fit into its broader narrative.

The show’s humor and willingness to poke fun at its own genre only strengthened its bond with fans. We weren’t just watching two brothers take on the apocalypse; we were in on the joke, laughing along as the writers playfully deconstructed the show’s own tropes. The fourth-wall-breaking episodes added a new dimension to the series, proving that _Supernatural_ wasn’t afraid to take risks, mock itself, or fully embrace the weird.

Whether you’re watching an emotional myth arc about Heaven and Hell, a spooky creature-of-the-week, or a meta episode that leaves you laughing out loud, _Supernatural_ mastered the art of keeping its audience on their toes. One moment you’re on the edge of your seat, the next you’re in stitches—but no matter what, you’re invested. That’s the magic of this show: the perfect balance of humor, horror, and heart.

**Family and Sacrifice: The Heartbeat of Supernatural**
“Saving people, hunting things—the family business.” It’s more than a catchphrase. For the Winchesters, it’s a creed. Right from the first episode, _Supernatural_ drives home the fact that the Winchester family isn’t like most others. They don’t sit down for Sunday dinners or swap happy holiday stories. Their legacy is blood-soaked, hard-earned, and filled with impossible choices. For Sam and Dean, family isn’t just about genetics—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and the willingness to walk into hell (sometimes literally) to save the people you love.

But _Supernatural_ doesn’t stop at biological bonds. While the show’s emotional center is Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection, it constantly reminds us that family is about more than blood. From Bobby Singer to Castiel, Charlie Bradbury to Jodie Mills, the Winchesters build a found family around them, one forged in battle and trust.

Bobby isn’t just the grizzled hunter who helps from the sidelines. He’s the father figure the brothers desperately needed after losing their own. And when Bobby sacrifices everything to protect Sam and Dean, it’s not out of duty—it’s love. His gruff “idjits” is always laced with affection, making his inevitable departure one of the series’ most heartbreaking moments. For Bobby, family meant being willing to give everything, even when there was nothing left to give.

Then there’s Castiel. The angel who started off as Heaven’s loyal soldier quickly became something far more complex—a brother in arms, a friend, and ultimately, family. Castiel’s arc is one of the most poignant examples of _Supernatural’s_ exploration of loyalty. His decision to fall from grace, to fight alongside the Winchesters instead of against them, represents the power of chosen family. Castiel’s ultimate sacrifice for Dean—driven by love, not duty—solidifies his place as a Winchester, proving that sometimes, the strongest family ties aren’t the ones we’re born with, but the ones we create.

And who could forget the fierce women of _Supernatural_? Charlie Bradbury might not have been born into the hunter life, but she earned her place through loyalty and guts. As a geeky, fearless hacker turned badass hunter, Charlie shows us that family can be chosen. Her bond with the Winchesters ran deep, and her tragic end still stings because she wasn’t just a friend—she was family. Jodie Mills, on the other hand, stepped into the role of protector, becoming a mother figure to a new generation of hunters. She didn’t have to take these lost girls under her wing, but she did because, in _Supernatural_, family is about showing up when no one else will.

Time and time again, _Supernatural_ shows us that family means sacrifice. The Winchesters ask themselves the hard question: how far would you go for the people you love? And the answer is always: further than you think. Whether it’s Dean making deals with demons to save Sam, or Sam risking his life to pull Dean from the brink, their story is one of selflessness—sometimes to a fault.

And that’s where the real beauty of the show lies. It’s not just about hunting monsters or saving the world. It’s about the people you’re willing to stand beside in the fight. It’s about the love, loyalty, and sacrifice that define the Winchester legacy. Because in _Supernatural_, family isn’t just a bond—it’s a battle. And even when the stakes are cosmic, it always comes down to saving people and hunting things, because that’s the family business.

**The Fandom That Kept It Alive: The Power of the SPN Family**
When we talk about _Supernatural_ unprecedented 15-season run, there’s one undeniable force that carried the show through every twist, turn, and apocalyptic showdown: the SPN Family. It’s more than just a fanbase—this community of devoted viewers, creators, and passionate advocates became the backbone of _Supernatural_, driving its success and influencing the way fandoms interact with television today. From launching fan campaigns to attending conventions, the SPN Family didn’t just support the show—they helped shape it.

What makes _Supernatural_ unique is how it built this loyal, worldwide following, despite starting off as an under-the-radar series on The WB (remember that network?). Back in 2005, _Supernatural_ premiered to modest ratings, with no guarantee it would survive past its first season. The show might have flown under the radar of the mainstream critics, but the fans? They saw something special.

It wasn’t long before the SPN Family transformed into a cultural powerhouse, keeping _Supernatural_ alive through low ratings, network shifts, and even a writer’s strike. While some shows rely solely on their storylines or cast to stay afloat, _Supernatural_ had something extra: a fanbase that wasn’t afraid to fight for it. These weren’t casual viewers tuning in once a week—they were engaged, connected, and fiercely loyal.

Fan conventions were one of the biggest drivers behind this loyalty. Year after year, conventions like Creation Entertainment’s Salute to Supernatural became pilgrimage spots for fans to meet their favorite cast members, share their art, theories, and stories, and celebrate their love for the show. For many, these events were more than just photo-ops or autograph sessions—they were community-building hubs. Here, fans bonded over their shared love of all things Winchester, forming friendships and creating memories that transcended the screen.
But what truly sets the SPN Family apart is its activism. The fans didn’t just watch and engage—they gave back. From charity drives inspired by the cast to campaigns like Random Acts (founded by Misha Collins, the actor behind Castiel), the SPN Family showed that they were willing to take their love for the show and channel it into positive real-world change. It’s this deeper level of engagement that sets them apart from your average fandom.

And here’s the thing—the _Supernatural_ team knew how much the fandom mattered. They weren’t just passive observers—they embraced the SPN Family, making them a part of the narrative. Episodes like “Fan Fiction” and “The Monster at the End of This Book” celebrated the fans in a way no other series had done before, blending real-life fandom with the fictional world of the Winchesters. In the meta episodes, the show didn’t just break the fourth wall—it leaned into it, acknowledging fan fiction, fan theories, and even shipping (Dean/Cas, anyone?) with a wink and a nod.

More than once, the SPN Family made the impossible happen. After all, it was fan dedication that helped push _Supernatural_ into its 15th season, a feat almost unheard of in genre television. And when the show finally aired its last episode, the fandom didn’t just disappear. The community, built over 15 years of love, continues to thrive through fan projects, conventions, and online spaces dedicated to keeping the _Supernatural_ spirit alive.

In an age where shows often live and die by network decisions or fluctuating ratings, _Supernatural_ proved that the voice of the fans could be louder than any number crunching in a studio boardroom. The SPN Family wasn’t just a group of people who liked a show—they were the fuel that kept the engine running, year after year, apocalypse after apocalypse.

So, while the Winchesters may have closed the final chapter of their story, the SPN Family ensures that the legacy of _Supernatural_ lives on. It’s a testament to the power of community, proving that when fans truly care, they can keep a story alive well beyond its final credits.

**The Legacy of Supernatural**
When the curtains finally closed on _Supernatural_ after a monumental 15-season run, it was clear the show had left behind more than just a string of successful episodes. It had built a universe, a community, and a legacy that reshaped how genre TV could be experienced. What started as a story about two brothers hunting monsters morphed into a saga that dived deep into mythology, human emotion, and, most importantly, the concept of family—both by blood and by choice.

The show’s impact isn’t just measured by its episode count or ratings—it’s about the lives it touched. For many fans, _Supernatural_ became more than just a weekly watch; it was a constant through the ups and downs of their lives. The show’s exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what’s right, even when it’s hard, resonated deeply. It gave viewers more than just entertainment—it offered comfort and a sense of belonging.

And let’s not forget the way _Supernatural_ evolved the landscape of TV storytelling. It mixed procedural elements with an ongoing mythology in a way that allowed it to flex between epic apocalyptic plots and intimate character-driven moments. It embraced a _meta_ sense of humor that blurred the line between fiction and reality, giving fans episodes that felt like inside jokes shared by a family—fitting for a show that always came back to the theme of familial bonds.

As for the cast, they weren’t just characters on a screen. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and the rest became household names, in no small part due to the accessibility and warmth they showed to their fans. It’s rare for a cast to engage so fully with their audience, and that, perhaps, is _Supernatural’s_ real magic. The sense of community fostered between the creators, cast, and audience is something most shows can only dream of achieving. It’s why, even after the final episode aired, the SPN Family continues to thrive.

At its core, Supernatural was about more than just hunting monsters or saving the world. It was about connection—the connection between characters, the connection between the show and its audience, and the connections it fostered between fans around the globe. For 15 years, Supernatural wasn’t just a show; it was a phenomenon. And in that time, it proved one truth above all else: that family doesn’t end in blood.","Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Misha Collins",1.0,False,0.0,2005.0

If you one of the few, who has been living under a rock, go see an episode. | I don’t think this is the best episode of the Simpsons, it’s not even in the period most consider the best seasons (4-8), but it’s my favorite episode. It perfectly encapsulates what made the Simpsons amazing in the 90s: right amount of heart, wacky but not balls to the wall, and integrating a celebrity without it seeming like the episode was one long promo for that celebrity – fully understand the irony of that because he’s playing Michael Jackson in the episode. You can read more of my review here: https://imdgflicks.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/throwback-thursday-tv-review-simpsons-s3e01-stark-raving-dad/ | Every now and again you find something hanging around in the back of the fridge or freezer you forgot to throw away. That's how I feel about The Simpsons. 

Its humour is, in my opinion, long past its ""use by"" date, feeling stale and tired. Its a shame it hasn't been shelved as what it did do back in the day, premiering on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" (remember her?) was fantastic, witty and current. 

For myself I'd rather remember The Simpsons for what it was than what I believe its become. 4/10 from me. | The Simpsons is my all time favorite show! I am 13, and I can relate in so many ways since the Simpsons are an average American family! My favorite character is Lisa because even though she feels lonely because of her smarts, she prevails and overcomes so many ... | To address the failing quality:

The Simpsons once mocked and then it became mainstream pop culture. So that is a cause of why it has declined.

And another cause is that there is a new PC comedy trend to laugh at things. As in the audience is expected to laugh at the object itself without having an actual joke behind it. As in, ""This is a computer, Laugh at it!""

Because of that we see a transformation of the jokes. The celebrity guests were once the butt of the joke. Mulder and Scully came on and the Simpsons mocked them. Now the joke is the celebrity guest. As in, ""This is Lady Gaga,"" or ""this is Michelle Obama.""

They aren't spoofed or satirized in any way, the audience is just asked to laugh at the fact that they have a celebrity guest.

And the final reason is the laugh track comedy, in which the Simpsons has none. That is no laugh track. But now the writing sets up the jokes with almost a pause for laughter as if the tracks were there.

In the past the jokes were piled onto one another. There would be several jokes stacked right next to one another in a single event. Now it has become joke, pause to acknowledge the joke, continue.

But no ones really laughing because it's no longer mocking culture, it's no longer spoofing the celebrity guests, and it's lost virtually all of its edge. | Despite a MAJOR decline in Quality, The Simpsons is still one of the greatest Television shows of all time. Its peaks are some of the highest out there, and it has been able to regain its footing as of late.

**SEASON 02:**

When I watched the first season when it was originally aired, it had some serious fan following, but I won't say it was very very famous at the time. Now, after the second season, seems everything has changed. Drastically the votings, rating, reviews have increased. IF one more season with similarly powerful characters, story comes out, then it surely would be among the greatest like 'Dexter', 'Breaking Bad' et cetera. I am confident it will go up to the seventh to set up a perfect finale in the next half decade.

I did not review the first season, because I was not sure it would get better in the following season. I thought it was a one season thing. Now I'm here with awesome progression in the second season. I loved every episode. I've rated a few of them are out of out as they are well deserved. Firstly, for this to get better was the characters. A couple of new ones added. Not some sidekicks, but yes, they were with a stronger hold in the main narration.

I loved Charlotte, the Lucifer's mother. That's the best thing happened here. Particularly the casting for it was the best pick. Tricia Helfer was like never seen before hot. The way the season ended was sad, if you had loved her. I hope she returns none other than as Charlotte in the future. Aimee Garcia was another highlitable cast. Her inclusion makes the crime fighting more interesting. She's a mini Dexter, without the dark desires.

Each episode was unique, but the overall story flow was excellent, unlike the previous season where each episode has one crime to solve. Here too with the same style, but some time extended further for the next part. There was an aim for story to head, but the way it was presented was good. Shared it all throughout the season, while each episode had its own agenda. Lots of humours, as well as actions, adventures, suspense and a bit romantic.

So, if you haven't started, it's time to do so, because as I said it will be one of the best television programme on making that you should not miss while you have chance to follow from the beginning itself. All the actors were great, a well written and shot series. The season's finale and its final scene created more curiosity in me going to the third. I'm hoping for another magnificent season, which is due in a couple of months at the end of the year (2017). Highly recommended!

_9/10_ | It's trash..Just like other 98.5% of Netflix shows. | This show started in 2016 and has six seasons, ending(?) 2021.  It turned to trash around the end of the 2nd or 3rd seasons.  
The storytelling for the show or premise was a mortal female cop having to work with the Devil to solve crimes.  The Devil is on earth because he became fed up with his role as Hell's Ruler.  And the writers did very well with the Lucifer character.  Many aspects to the Devil being supernatural came through wonderfully for the audience, one profound trait being _Lucifer_ (**Tom Ellis**) refusing, or being under an angel geas, to be unable to speak a lie; so he goes around telling people the truth about who he is.  Not fighting this, or speaking around the truth makes the facet a very comically astute trait to the character for the show.  The way other mortal characters react to the news which is either to dismiss the claim outright or gloss over it as ramblings completes the humor; especially when they realize the truth through some supernatural display from the Devil himself.  And ofcourse the female detective, _Chloe Decker_ (**Lauren German**) also does not believe him, her job being based solely in proof and fact--evidence.  While there are numerous instances producing evidence to Lucifer's claim on who is, the detective still (ofcourse) can't believe it.  That is until Lucifer insist on proving it to Chloe directly.  To both their surprise, he finds out he can be injured when she is within close proximity to the Prince of Hell. 

The show did very well, even if one could foresee where hetero partnerships in tv shows eventually go.  That is foregone.  It's how the show gets the audience there which determines if there will be a following season.  And I will admit, I did not like the show.  I felt it to be a bit contrived, BUT worth giving a chance.  I, personally, thought the devil could be a bit more of a bad-ass; instead of just what the guy appeared to be, a cocktail party pianoist.  
Other aspects of Lucifer's divinity were introduced such as soul-deals being made, other angels, and eventually demons.  The first introduction to Lucifer's astranged family was _Amenidiel_ (**D.B. Woodside**), brother, self-proclaimed greatest warrior of heaven's Silver City, and the right-hand hatchet man for God.  My first ""dark cloud"" of foreboding on the show peeked through when I heard Amenidiel address the Devil with the nick-name: (...jeez) ""Luci.""  Pronounced ""Lucy.""  But I (with effort) dismissed it.  I told myself ""GIVE it a chance.""  I did, and the show did not fail to deliver entertainment.  
Ellis and German's characters have good chemistry in front of the camera, and the plethora of well-known TV stars featured in the episodes, kept everyones' attention and pleased to look forward to the next show.  Other characters to become regulars co-stars include Lucifer's right-hand, the head Executioner of Hell (...sighs) Maze. _Maze_ is played by **Lesley-Ann Brandt** from cable tv's hit NC-17 rated show, _Spartacus_.  Maze's character is easily summed up (in a good way) as kung-fu Biker Bitch with knives and a penchant for extreme BDSM when in a good mood.  When she is in a bad mood she fills the role of Amenidiel's mirror opposite for the Devil.  The two are not on the same power level, with Amenidiel being the top warrior angel, but when earthbound, Maze has the upper hand in dealing with and understanding humans.  
There is _Dan Espenoza_ (**Kevin Alejandro** -- whose credited filmography is very strong in TVseries) as Chloe's ex-crooked detective husband, and their daughter _Trixie Espenoza_ (**Scarlett Estavez**).  Also introduced is Lucifer's psychiatrist, _Dr. Linda Martin_ (**Rachel Harris**), whom which Lucifer constantly misinturpret's her advice she futiley tries to guide him with.  Lastly was the (I think) sudden appearence of character _Ella Lopez_ (**Aimee Garcia**).  The plucky and ""loveable"" forensic specialist.  All these characters make up a pretty good cast and the writers did the show and characters justice.  The show looked promising, until...[que sound bite] >DUNT, DUNT, DUUUUUUUUUUHHHH!!!!!<  The third season began.

**WARNING:** This review gets more personable from here, meaning if you like the show, the following will come off as a bunch of whining & complaining.  If you feel take-it-or-leave-it about the show then there will be some ""Oh yeah"" moments.  If the show had you at a point to where you throw your hands up like a BlackJack dealer leaving the table, then I appreciate the high-fives.  

When the show goes down hill...My most glaring complaint was Amenidiel getting Dr. Linda Martin pregnant.  I mean, c'MON!!!  Woodside is 52 and I would have thought this guy was going _into his 40s_ ; not leaving.  Harris is 54.  And she looks _every bit_ of closing her late fifties!!  When I first saw the woman as the shrink I thought, ""She is too old to be wearing her hair that long.""  And it was a sad attempt, just like later with Lucifer's ""mother"" being introduced, at making a woman not look her age.  When it is sooooo apparent she is the oldest person on the cast.  But this season happened when Liberal-Left thinkers were in full speed ahead and forcing ideals of interracial dating, virtue-signaling, inclusivity of the ""alphabet people"" into the viewing audience's faces as if Gay Judgement Day were at hand.  And along with Dr. Martin's geriatric defience of science (bars) came Maze's sudden ability to kiss women.  It wasn't a big stretch seeing as demons are not known for having a concept of shame, propriety, or morals but the clam-to-clam thing is NOT as endearing as the writers may think.  Girl-on-Girl stuff is exciting IN adult movies and R-rated movies; typically where nudity is involved.  Seen in any other muted venue, and...it's just...ew.  
Next complaint was the shoe-horning in of the forensic specialist, Ella Lopez.  I say it that way because the show goes through an _entire_ season before this character is introduced.  And when she does hit the scene, Garcia's makes her character come across as too personally familiar with the main characters to the point of being overbearing.  It's...off-putting to say the least.  It's like literally _no one_ knows who this chick is, and since she is coming in on the SECOND season after all the other characters are established in the first season,  the vibe leaves the viewer thinking, ""Jeez, this chick is severely un-professional, and a borderline sociopath.  No one (in the viewership) knows you 'Ella!'  You have no previous interactions with the main characters!!  Why are you acting like the three of you had beers two nights earlier??""  She is a stranger to the audience and the main characters, BUT she's the forensic specialist and now they _have_ to talk to her whether the audience likes her or not.  So, there's that.   
The third and fourth seasons are not bad if you can exclude the ever growing Liberal agenda being shoved into everyone's faces.  Charlie, Amenidiel's son gets kidnapped because demons come looking for a new ruler of Hell.  Lucifer's mother is trying to fit in with humans, and gets involved with Dan.  Lopez is having existential crisis because she dated a psycho.  And Lucifer after getting his mother to begin her own plain of existence, returns to Hell as it's ruler.  

> **The third and fourth seasons moved along, but then the fourth season had to end with God becoming _senile!?_  Loosing his powers..!?  Then _joining_ his wife in her reality to be essentially a stay-at-home dad!?!  As Bill Cosby would say, ""What in the filth-flarn-filth is going on with this show!?!""  Yeah.  I didn't have high hopes for the following season.  And I was right.**

The fifth season has Lucifer as a bumbling idiot, blamed for being an absentee father by a daughter (**Briana Hildebrand** -- Negasonic Teenage Warhead--[though a lot chunkier now], _Deadpool_), he never knew about, from the future.  She claims he disappeared before she was born; abandoning a pregnant Decker.  And let's just cast aside all that lore about the apocalypse should Lucifer ever beget a woman with child.  No, let's look past Lucifer making a fool of himself trying to assuage this young lady's misplaced anger over something he apparently had no choice or control.  Let's forget he lied to her in the second episode, something he is not supposed to be able to do, about him knowing she was his.  Hey, she's angry, gay--because ofcourse, her father wasn't around--, and something of an ungrateful bitch; so that means she can act out however she wants. >eyeroll<  Maze and Eve are getting married >eghk< when suddenly Eve's ex-husband, Adam, shows up. 
 And unlike her, he's whiter than Johnny Appleseed & Wonderbread put together.  I thought this was supposed to inclusive & diverse...??  The one thing I can say about Woke-Hollywood nowadays, is that if a white guy is on the scene you can gar-rown-tee he's a bad guy.  Don't believe me, just ask Cain (season 3).   You'd think Woke-Hollywood would be able to stick to their marshmellow guns and find a well-tanned good looking Hispanic or Hindu to play Adam.  But noooooo.  It's not a show if you don't reveal how evil the white man can be.  

Yeah, Much like this review, Lucifer went on waaaaaaay too long.  I gave it 2 out 5 stars because I liked the first 3 seasons.  After that, the show has my condolences. | I started watching this a few months ago as I found it on Netflix. I watched the trailer and thought it looked very interesting. I thought I would watch just one or two episodes each day or whenever I had time. Man, I was wrong. I ended up watching half of the first season that day, then the second half the next. A couple of days later I began looking into buying the DVDs. And the series was finished a few months later. I would recommend this to anyone who has seen Izombie (has the same crime concept) or anyone who loves Supernatural-type shows. | Lucifer"" is a woeful excuse for a television series, a devilish descent into the depths of mediocrity that leaves its audience longing for salvation from its torturous plot and laughable attempts at wit.

At its core, ""Lucifer"" revolves around the most overused and unoriginal concept imaginable: the Devil himself forsaking his infernal throne to play detective in Los Angeles. It's a premise that would make even the most dedicated connoisseur of the supernatural cringe in embarrassment. Instead of offering a fresh take on the age-old battle between good and evil, the show falls flat with its trite, uninspired narrative.

The acting in ""Lucifer"" is nothing short of painful. Tom Ellis's portrayal of Lucifer Morningstar is more irritating than charismatic, leaving viewers yearning for a more captivating devil to grace the screen. The supporting cast fares no better, with performances that range from wooden to outright cringe-worthy. The attempts at humour are so forced and awkward that they often elicit groans instead of laughs.

The show's writing is equally abysmal. The dialogue is filled with clunky one-liners and contrived attempts at clever wordplay that would make even the most hackneyed stand-up comedian wince. The attempts at exploring moral and ethical dilemmas are shallow at best, reducing complex issues to simplistic and predictable resolutions.

One of the most egregious offenses of ""Lucifer"" is its blatant misuse of religious and mythological elements. The show's portrayal of celestial and infernal realms is nothing short of sacrilegious, reducing profound religious themes to nothing more than a backdrop for mediocre crime-solving escapades. It's disrespectful to both religious believers and those who appreciate thoughtful storytelling.

The special effects and production values are subpar, to say the least. The supernatural elements, including Lucifer's wings and powers, are rendered with all the finesse of a low-budget B-movie. The show's depiction of hell is equally underwhelming, lacking the grandeur or terror that one would expect.

In summary, ""Lucifer"" is a satanic series in the worst sense of the word—a soulless, uninspired, and downright painful viewing experience. It takes a potentially intriguing premise and squanders it on a poorly executed, cringe-inducing mess of a show. If you value your time and sanity, steer clear of this devilish disaster of a series.","Tom Ellis, Lauren German, Kevin Alejandro, D.B. Woodside, Lesley-Ann Brandt",0.0,False,0.0,2016.0

The unimaginative and rather cheesily titled ""Dexter Original Sin"" is, unlike the original series, about as subtle as a meat clever. 

The sense of light, sophisticated handling associated with the original series, is largely absent.Instead, the treatment is over the top, at times bordering on the ridiculous. We see Dexter looking at a girly mag but no he's really fawning over news cuttings of serial killer Ted Bundy wedged between its pristine pages. Oh and his sister ends up passed out drunk at a party about to be raped but after Dexter intercedes to save her, she can still apparently ""take care of herself"".

The unforgiving gore and genuine horror element that the show first offers are among its most distinctive features, but even these begin to wear thin as the season progresses. By the time I finished the first season, I couldn’t help but feel underwhelmed.

Although a second season is in the works, “From” barely does enough to keep me returning for more. I would probably tell my past self not to watch it if I could go back in time.

Even though I’m drawn in by the mystery, I’m worried about the show’s future. The writing is reminiscent of J.J. Abrams; the writers are adding mysteries at whim with no idea how to resolve them. Intriguing at first, but the poor writing soon began to sour the experience.

If you enjoy mysteries, you might want to give “From” a shot, but be aware that it features subpar acting and a superfluous plot that will make you lament the wasted opportunities. It’s far from bad, but it’s also not particularly noteworthy given the calibre of television we’ve been spoilt by in 2022.

[From] - Season One: 6.6/10 (Fair) | Loved the series! | Great TV series | A solid 10/10 series from a storytelling perspective. Honestly, the trailer didn't attract me that much, but I decided to give it a chance, and after the first 3 episodes, I couldn't stay away from this show. What fascinated me the most was the people behind this series because the story is exceptional; I found myself deeply engaged with the characters, trying to find an escape route along with them. I quickly finished the first two seasons, and now I have to wait for season 3, but I can't wait for it to come out. I have an idea of how the next season could be based on the ending of season 2, but my mind is not as brilliant as the minds of the people who created this show. If you enjoy series that make you think and deliver a guaranteed outcome for you, only to completely change the situation and leave you in suspense and mystery, then this is a great show to watch. | **_No Spoilers_**

Knowing some of the same people involved with LOST were working on this is what got me to watch it. First season there were definitely more questions than answers but that's not a bad thing. It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next and how the heck at they going to get out.

I think the current 3rd seasons has really upped the game with a story line on the 'outside' and inside which gets you thinking how it's all connected. Season 3 also seems to take some pretty big steps in answering some questions we've had in the back of our minds for the first 2 seasons. I hope they learned their lesson from LOST and don't let it drag on like that and wrap up the story in 5 seasons, 6 max. 

**I highly recommend** it for anyone who enjoys a good mystery/drama but the horror aspects might be a little much for some.

Unnecessary, stupid decisions.
Everywhere.

The typical ""say something!"" \*stuttering and stammering* to introduce some side-story, or secret personas where the only thing to change is the hero's suit, or a wimpy protagonist who has way too many scenes of indecisiveness, long and drawn out dialogues (seriously 2x the speed and it's like things are normal again), extraneous lies to create drama, etc. etc. etc.

It's like a trope collection turned into a superhero series with a ""*gotcha!*"" twist. Seriously, the acting and the story is good, but the tropes kill every redeeming quality.

It's a tragedy | A great series set in a world where superheroes are a real phenomenon.

Capitalism is omnipresent, profit and money are in everyone's mind.
Of course the 'Sups' abuse their power for their own interests and many more cruel and immoral things.
Every hero's doing is explained, some more, some less. There's a perfect balance between big serious storylines and little kind of darker humor ones. 

'The Boys' are trying to destroy this whole system due to personal problems with some of the 'Sups'. The focus clearly is around them and what they're doing. 
So it's definitely an Anti-Superhero show which look and topic reminds me of 'Watchmen' or some other more Noir candidates in this genre.

The whole series is explicit, which adds up really well. Without the violence and the handling with sexual situations the whole show wouldn't be that impressive and near to the reality. Not appropriate for younger viewers, if you ask me. | For me the whole series is a total and effective satire that lets us see what would become of the world if fiction becomes reality: heroes lose interest in saving the world (or take advantage of its status), are forced to do things that are not right, to follow the company's own interests and do not go out to end the crime if they are not followed by a camera that captures each of their movements, even though they are always transmitting that image of exemplary citizen when in fact they are greedy and treat their fans badly.

It's also chilling to know that people in power act as judges and executioners to decide what crimes are profitable and what millions of dollars they rent their superheroes to other cities so they can be safe. The precision in the denunciation of The Boys is one of its strongest points since satire towards these characters is not new, but combining it with the theme of corporate America and wild capitalism gives it a clear differential touch.

The series is a total hit and is perfectly developed, to the point of making it impossible to miss because chapter by chapter the anguish increases. So if you have free time, I strongly recommend you to watch this satirical series. | The series had the potential to follow in the footsteps of Watchmen, but woke took over and squelched any objective socio-political commentary that the original comic may have had. Any and all characters in any sort of power position - unless it's the bad guy - is female. It's so obvious and boring a trope that it distracts from the already heavy burden of suspension of disbelief put onto the viewer from being a superhero movie. All characters are equally unlikable scumbags, which may be a part of the original design, but the viewer doesn't know who to root for as the story goes on and more detestable superficiality of the once sympathetic character gets frittered away. Gore and sex are always fun, but in this case the series tries so hard and goes so overboard that anyone who dares to watch the series through might as well have a barf bag on hand. 
So much hateful political rhetoric, so much woke, so much racist agenda, so much sexism, that I'm not looking forward to going any further than season 3. Enjoy at your own risk, and even that only if you're on a certain side of the very extremist political spectrum. | At least it has Simon Pegg in it, who Hugh was based on. And I kind of can't picture the show without his involvement.

It's not as Garth Ennis as I think it should be, it's not as vulgar and offensive and fun as he usually is, and certainly as The Boys was in print... but it comes really close to making that mark, and that is a breath of fresh air given the way that both comic books, and the movies they are based on are going.

Ultimately, it's still vulgar, offensive, bloody and funny, even if it could have been more.

And it's only 8 episodes, which seems a lot like they aren't trying to drag the story out just to add more, and that is also refreshing.

Ultimately, it's a cure for modern comics in a very late 90s British Invasion kind of way | The Boys started off well enough but any potential it might have had as entertainment, backed by legitimate social commentary, has been quickly astro-turfed by the agenda pedlars. 

This series positively oozes woke. If there's a politically loaded pitch to be made, in my opinion, there's a good chance you'll find it here. What I personally found even more odious, in the current season (4) is the belittling of those who question the mainstream. Yes, to question the established narrative is to  be a rube, a fool, a bumpkin, a nobody, who waves a flag and blows an air horn.

Of course, ironically the mainstream, especially the mainstream media, have never been more doubted. Small wonder they have taken to dosing peoples entertainment in a clumsily transparent attempt, to lure the ""sheep' back into the pen. 

Suffice to say, lots of wasted potential here. Decent acting, some excellent idea's, all buried beneath thick cheesy layers of mainstream conformism. Ironically, the complete antithesis of the so called reactionary individualism, allegedly inherent, in the series key characters.

In summary, when ersatz counter culture is a counter for legitimate counter culture. This series started out well but now its subverting nothing. Its just another pitch, for mainstream woke conformism. The fact they need to sell ""this hard"", for me at least, offers a degree of insight into how many people are actually buying in.... | The Boys on Prime Video is a dark, thrilling take on superheroes that I can’t get enough of. It’s intense, funny, and filled with unexpected twists that keep you hooked. Soldier Boy is my favorite character—his complex, no-nonsense attitude adds a unique edge to the show. And, of course, Butcher’s relentless, gritty personality is second to none. With powerful performances, sharp social commentary, and unforgettable action, The Boys is an addictive ride through a world where heroes aren’t always what they seem. | AN AMAZING WATCH. Really loved Homelander and all his antics.","Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, Jessie T. Usher",0.0,False,0.0,2019.0

Ever since hipster 20-somethings with a passion for memes and existentialism took control, I felt like the only one who could feel his childhood slowly starting to melt, and not realise it until one of these shows got spoiled more than possibly any show that’s ever buzzed in front of me.

Steven would be a perfectly good watch if it was placed alongside livelier, more timeless shows that didn’t have any subject matter that would fly over childrens’ heads but could entertain adults in equal measures, but it represents the best and worst of present-day Cartoon Network; characters with defined personalities, strong she-leads, smart writing and complex, human storytelling, but also humour that sees its web popularity as no coincidence, melodrama prominent to the point of becoming forced, more reliance on internet culture than any other network and diversity so broad that it becomes a tad overbearing. I’m all for progressiveness, but the problem is that these so-called cartoons are designed, written and created by the average Tumblr/Twitter user, these being the (un)safe havens for Japan-inspired nerds and crazy social justice warriors. This is exactly why I had doubts about the Powerpuffs being rebooted from the moment they announced that they’d do it.

Yes, I’m the kind of person who looks for mature stories surrounding real situations and characters with depth, and animation has provided and should provide more mature stories than so many American movie studios think it can. Animation should be treated like the kind of art it is. But animation can’t just have one single personality. As proven with all its original programming from Steven to PPG 2016, no matter how good, Cartoon Network is just too real now to even be considered 'Cartoon' Network. That doesn't mean to say that this new version of Cartoon Network shouldn't embrace influence or teach acceptance, especially in this age of a president with a desire to barricade his people against any ""terrorists"" who aren't white or cisgendered, but to do so without pandering would require subtlety, something the Crewniverse fails to recognise.

Opinions on this show are respectable, but this fandom has grown to be a clustercuss that in many cases fills in for bronies; almost everyone I know has Peridot or a gem’s meme-y face as their icon and will spoil an episode for what feels like an eternity after its premiere. Some fans will even look past the show’s morals about acceptance no matter what size, gender, sexuality, mental issue or whatnot and trash each other to the brink of suicide. I’m losing enjoyment of this show even during its best episodes not just because it isn’t as effective as, say, Wander Over Yonder or BoJack Horseman, but the thoughts of this fandom and the slow death of comedy at the CN Studios invade my brain constantly and make me feel like a bitter old man trapped in the body of guy in his early 20′s. And during this experience, Lauren Zuke Joss Whedon’d her Twitter because of fans crying like the characters in this show over their ships.

After two episodes, that raise more questions than they answer, its hard to tell. So far, what can be clearly enunciated is a quality back story. A story that's akin to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, with a dystopian, almost cyber punk setting, in an underground, end of the world, style bunker. 

A strong cast back up, the so far, elaborate story and setting. Like the story itself, the characterisations have a subdued quality about them.

If you're obsessed with zombie lore and the idea of watching the long-term effects spanning years at a time on an entire cast of characters, then this show is for you. There are a lot of scary parts with zombies eating and the gore and visual effects are award winning, but the show is mostly how people get along with each other during an apocalyptic setting and how they rebuild civilization or just live moment to moment. | Zombie stories and fighting zombies always meant something.Suspans,thriller,horror scenes are exactly what these movies needs.So enjoy watching this!😀 | Seasons 1 to 4 were great. It's all downhil from there on - because - you guessed it - diversity and political corectness. In a zombie movie! HAH! Don't watch this. | _The Walking Dead_ is one of those shows you just can't help but love! 

A terrifying story of human survival in an apocalyptic world. The show deals with love, loss, zombies (called 'walkers' on the show), death, destruction and zombies!
Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, Melissa McBride and Lauren Cohan are amongst the star studded cast who deliver **OUTSTANDING** performances in every episode. 

_The Walking Dead_ is consistently thrilling and emotionally resonant, with solid character development and enough blood-splattering gore to satisfy anyone! The comic book counterpart has a big influence on the show, so fans of the comic love it too.

Each season gives enough compelling character moments to reward longtime fans, while maintaining the back-breaking tension and suspense that keeps audiences watching again and again.

_The Walking Dead_ puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre, and each season demonstrates why it's one of the best horror shows on television. | The walking Dead is in once sense a metaphor for whats happened to this once great show. 

The originality of the first few seasons has gradually given way to a repetitiousness that tells me the show might still be shuffling along but its long since dead.

The departure of Andrew Lincoln was a sign that things had come full circle and I had thought they would wind it up which, in my view, would have been the sensible thing to do.

Still watching but only because I want to see where it ends. If indeed it ends. Moderately watchable. 6/10 from me. | unique! perfect show, and more if you focus on the psycologie and sociologie side! in constant evoluion... even if after season 4 or 6 we can see deterioration with the quality and building storyline; we can enjoy a clear amelioration for the best in the 8th season opening our mind to a new vision of the series ! 
it""s a free adaptation from a popular american comic! and it""s a pleasure to see this worl in black mirors ;) | Best TV show about zombies. | **SEASON TEN REVIEW:**
<br />Season rating: 8/10
<br />Overall show rating: 10/10

Still my favourite show, even ten seasons in.

This feels like a very long season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant a near twelve-month run from episode one to sixteen. That isn't the show's fault of course. Due to that, I had to refresh my mind as to what happened between E1/16 and a lot does occur in S10. I enjoyed all of it, I particularly love how gory the show is at times while the look of the walkers continues to impress with each episode. I like the S10 storyline, very intrigued to see how the final season goes.

Norman Reedus (Daryl), Danai Gurira (Michonne), Melissa McBride (Carol) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Negan) remain the pick of the show's cast, but you also have the likes of Samantha Morton (Alpha) and Ryan Hurst (Beta) in there too. Cailey Fleming (Judith) is still remarkable, she acts way beyond her young years. There are a few others who are good too.

I'm not saying it's the greatest show ever, but 'The Walking Dead' is my standout show personally. I love it. Bring on S11. | Paul Cantor has spoken well of this series. So at a moment I started binging on this series.

The first season was okay. Not so good, but far better than the crap losers tell people ”you have to watch the first five seasons till the action starts”. Watchable.

The second season got more interesting. One has to get past the unlimited ammo, and the unlimited gas available. After all these are the stupid kids who wanted to make momma proud: I got a college diploma, it's Creative Writing. The interaction was okay.

The third season and things are picking up. Never mind the breeding the specie mission. These are individuals. And they are cooperating to get past the greater obstacles, than they are out, each on their way. Nice.

Negan was annoying. He was over the top. And that was good. After all Negan is the Government: sadistic, ready to destroy anything that doesn't obey his whims, he has rules, and prisons, and reeducation, and justice.

And everything was okay, up to season 8. In season 8, the team slowly turns into a nationalistic bureaucracy. People have to sacrifice, not to save their dear ones, but ”for the tribe”. The good guys turn into monsters, and they are starting to lead politics: they ”civilize” the outsiders, or kill them all, just like Negan. All the characters become toxic: from trying to survive, they are now planning how to massacre ”them” before ”they” ”get” ”us”. Disgusting.

Season 8 was a let down. Season 9 was deplorable. Everybody had a little Negan inside, ready to get out and choke humanity out of any living being.

Season 10, well, I should not have watched it, but you know: National House Arrest. Everything becomes a regular sitcom: more and more characters are injected. They characters are diverse, because god willed it. The story becomes so dull, they have to splice many stories, and blend them together. So Team 1 is about to find out something, switch, Team 2 does something, but… switch, Team 3 is certain that something, switch, Team 1 found out the house is empty, they are planning their next move, when they hear a noise, switch, Team 2.

And now I am watching Season 11. Why? I have no idea. Maybe to say: I have watched it all. At least this is the last one, otherwise I would have waited for the next benevolent lockdown. Not only the boring stories are blended closer together, they are getting way beyond unlimited ammo: they get into a tunnel, to have some action, because they are not looking for anything in the tunnel. There is nobody behind. And in front there are bodies in bags. The zombies, after 12 years in bags, they are quite functional. And like the sensor in the fridge, one has to get close enough so they could start making the noise. And in the train there are zombies. And behind now it's full of zombies. And the missing characters pop up from the other direction? Where there are other zombies. What? Where? Or they raid a military base, Mission Impossible style. Why? Because. Period. Each time they waste bolts and arrows, but if they do the magical sleep, the game will replenish the stock after 8 hours of sleep. | I love this show so much I'm so addicted to what I can watch it read over and over and over and over again this is the best movie I've ever watched in my whole entire life I enjoyed every bit of it I hate to see how this show has to end I hope they still continue to keep going on I loved every character in this movie.","Lauren Cohan, Norman Reedus, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Melissa McBride, Christian Serratos",1.0,True,2.0,2010.0

He has money, toys, and rotating women, but he’s bored. So bored in fact that he has killed off his best-selling character, Derrick Storm, a rogue prone to danger. Castle’s looking for something new.

Enter Kate Beckett, a strong forceful female homicide detective. The fact that she’s also hot is irrelevant to her, but not to Castle. A serial killer is committing murders and staging them to look like kills from Castle’s books, so Beckett needs to interview him. He’s all play, she’s all business. She doesn’t think that he’s likely involved, but she has to interview him anyway.

Castle is hooked. He convinces the mayor to “let” him work the case as a consultant/advisor, much to Beckett’s dismay, and the game is afoot. Castle helps solve the case, and the successful partnership continues so Castle can do research.

As the opening narration reveals, every writer has his muse, and Castle thinks he’s found his. He even bases a new character on her — Nikki Heat. A strong forceful female homicide detective who works with a roguish mystery writer to solve cases. With a small difference — in his books, the two are lovers, which Castle wants to replicate with Beckett. But like I said, she’s all business.

Season 1: Beckett brings the serious, Castle makes it fun. 4/5

Season 2: Season 2 starts with Beckett and Castle on the outs, as she’s pissed at him for looking into her mother’s case at the end of season 1. By the end of the season, Castle is starting to give up the romantic chase, just as Beckett starts to think she likes the chase. 3/5

Season 3: This is the season where Castle hits its stride. Beckett and Castle are in a good place after the first couple of episodes, they’re in their groove, and they’re even making progress on the conspiracy that claimed Beckett’s mother. 4/5

Season 4: Building off Season 3, this season really starts to gel in certain areas. Which is odd, because the characters are written so they are NOT gelling…Castle finished off Season 3 with a big pronouncement, and Beckett says she doesn’t remember it. So they are at odds for most of the season. They have their moments, and then they have stumbling blocks. While a lot of Seasons 1-3 were about Castle growing up a little, finding something to care about besides being a playboy writer, this season is about Beckett growing as a person, finding something to care about other than her job. 4/5

Season 5: I really want to love this season, and there are some seriously good episodes, like Ryan going undercover or the Rear Window episode. And while the average is higher for individual EPs, driving the season up to 4.0 overall, my overall satisfaction was down — the backstory just wasn’t working for me any more around Bracken, 3XK, Beckett’s mom, and the wildside of Castle’s Dad’s story (great premise, not awesomely executed). 4/5

Season 6: The season starts off with Beckett working in Washington, and the whole dynamic just doesn’t work. I like the 3XK stuff, and a Carrie-like prank. I’ll even accept the wedding episode. But not a great season overall, one of the lower average scores so far. 3/5

Season 7: As I watched the episodes, I frequently felt, “Okay, last season”. Quite a few Eps seem like repeats of story ideas they’ve used before or promising ones that go nowhere. I was initially skeptical of the “Castle as P.I.” plot device, but it isn’t completely batty in its execution, and it does work for the most part. Washington? Not so much. 3/5

Season 8: There is an episode near the end (E19) that is one of the best of the series…it is funny, it is interesting, it is vintage Season 1 and 4 all together in a big bowl of mystery with comedy sprinkled on top. A complete palate cleanser from all the Eps filled with Angst. Yet by the time I got there, the first half of the season was almost making me wonder if I would continue watching. Definitely near the bottom of the seasons. 3/5 | This is one of those series in which you don't really care too much about the stories you just love to follow the characters. Nathan Fillion is perfect as Castle. If you like it when you can't stop grinding right through a show this one's for you. Oh, you might want to think twice about watching the last season though.

If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com

Stranger Things first appeared in our lives back in 2016 with its phenomenal first season, followed by a less amazing yet still entertaining Season 2. I was pretty excited for the third adventure with one of the best (if not the best) young ensemble casts ever. The acting in this show is unbelievable, even more when considering the age of most of the kids (14-17). Millie Bobby Brown is 15-years-old! Fifteen! Weirdly, the show will only be eligible for next year's Emmy's, but if she doesn't get nominated AND win, I sincerely don't know what she needs to do more. The seamless ease that Millie has in showing emotion and delivering those subtle expressions that only the best actors can achieve after years of experience ... She's going to break the Oscar record for youngest Best Actress / Best Supporting Actress winner. It's meant to happen.

I started with her because last season I handed the highlight crown to Noah Schnapp (Will Byers) who also gives an excellent performance, even if his character has less to do this time around (similar to the debut season). Of all the young actors, Millie is so much ahead of her fellow colleagues that she indirectly diminishes Sadie Sink's (Max) performance. They have completely different emotional responses to similarly painful events. Not that Sadie isn't able to transmit her feelings (I enjoyed both her and her character a lot more this season), but jumping from Eleven showing 200% of her emotion to any other character is always going to feel that the other actor/actress isn't at her level (truthfully though, they aren't).

In addition to Millie, the other standout has to be David Harbour as Jim Hopper. This might be the funniest season so far, as well as the most emotionally powerful. Both are due to Hopper's arc and Harbour's award-worthy performance. He's hilarious, happy, sad, angry, drunk, frustrated, proud, ... His arc is definitely the one that serves as a pillar to this season's structure. Without him, this season wouldn't be near to the quality it is. Harbour's chemistry with Winona Ryder (Joyce Byers) is palpable, and that's basically enough for me to have a great time. However, The Duffer Brothers really deserve a lot of credit. The writing is some of the best I've seen in the last few years.

Everyone hated Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) in the first season, but his development got such a fantastic treatment that now everyone loves him. The same happens with Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery). I genuinely hated him last season due to how cliche and lazily written he was. Now, even though his backstory isn't anything innovative, he's undoubtedly seen as a more compelling character, which proves that Stranger Things really doesn't have a single bad character (main or supporting, at least). Max also gets a better script, plus her on-screen time with Eleven helped the character become more interesting. Nevertheless, how's the main gang?!

Well, Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson) spends less time with his original friends, but his side adventure with Steve, Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson), and Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke), the newest addition to the show which is also the best surprise of the season, is also pretty entertaining even if it's connected to one of my issues (more on that soon). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), Will, Eleven, and Max have a whole romantic subplot that I surprisingly enjoyed mostly due to how realistic and heartfelt The Duffer Brothers wrote it. Obviously, comedy is always a must inside this group, and I wasn't disappointed, having dropped more than just a few laughs throughout the episodes.

Finally, Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers) and Natalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler) also have their own inspiring journey, the one that addresses the most how people had to live in the 80s. Dealing with discrimination, workplace injustices, and different lifestyles are put in perspective always through unforced dialogue and/or events. I really loved this season structure. How each group of characters has their own side adventure so that in the end, they can all team-up together to defeat the evil within Hawkins. I never felt bored or less engaged in a story. Season 2 had that horrible episode with Kali (Linnea Berthelson), and some episodes seemed to drag. Season 3 not only has the perfect runtime for each episode, but the story that they cover during each chapter is always remarkably captivating.

Of course, I always felt more entertained when Eleven and Hopper were on-screen, so their subplots obviously became my favorites. However, they don't take anything away from the remaining stories or characters. Evidence number one would be the best ending of the show. It's hard to hold off the tears during those last few moments, especially if you went through the same event (which 99% of people definitely did unless you had literally zero friends growing up). Technically, the show proves that you don't need a big budget to provide visual delight. From the appropriated costume design to the addictive 80s' style soundtrack, everything is on-point with tons of practical effects being employed. The CGI regarding the monsters and everything that comes with them are convincing enough, and the action sequences are mostly shot well. The editing gets a little sloppy near the final episodes, but nothing too serious.

My main and only issue with this season has to be the actual main plot. The thread that connects all of the subplots and groups of characters that I've been praising so much. Besides being very similar to the last season (monster comes, possesses people, and you know the rest), it's worse regarding the ""how"" and ""why"" the monsters came back. There's a whole story involving Russians, secret bases and codes, that feel too cheesy and over-the-top, reaching a level of absurdity that even affected some action scenes ""a la Fast and Furious"". It's unusual for the main plot to be as cliche and uninteresting as it is, while the side stories are astonishingly good.

All in all, Stranger Things delivers yet another fantastic season. Its debut continues to hold the #1 spot, but Season 3 is so much better than its predecessor. Once again, the characters are what make this show a massive success. Even separating everyone into different groups, the cast's phenomenal chemistry remains intact. Millie Bobby Brown takes her crown back from Season 2's highlight, Noah Schnapp, and guarantees herself tons of nominations and hopefully a few awards, due to a perfect display of her emotional range. David Harbour is right behind her, and then comes the rest of the ensemble cast, one of the best to ever grace a TV screen. The Duffer Brothers are masterful screenwriters, presenting extremely developed character scripts, as well as funny, exciting and entertaining side stories. Despite a less strong main plot, Stranger Things finishes this season with the best ending of the entire series. If you're not crying during the last 10 minutes … I don't know. Can't wait for Season 4, even if I would be more than satisfied to see it end its run now.

Rating: A- | I came to the latest season of Stranger Things with real reservations. I felt the last season was simply a recycling of what had gone before and wondered, if this wasn't another case of, ""rinse and repeat.""

Well, thankfully, that's not the case. The latest season adds new material and fleshes out the overall back story. Its suitably creepy too, with yet more 80's style nostalgia and one of my favourite Kate Bush songs. 

Everything is well placed, great sets, great acting and thrills that keep you coming back. Its sets things up beautifully for the next season too.
 | I don't remember Africa being that popular in the 80s... do you?  I mean, those of you who are old enough to actually remember the 80s.  It was a hit, I remember that.  I remember my mom liked it... my MOTHER liked it, which is sort of the population that Toto catered to, but I don't remember Africa having that much play on any station that anyone openly listened to until... what 2014 when Family Guy popularized it again because one of their writers played too much GTA in the early naughts.

Anyway, this show comes with a really important lesson.

It was great, it really was, the first seasons were pretty fantastic, and then it stank.  It went woke, the character did things they wouldn't do, things that were completely out of character, all the men became incompetent morons, and then....

... and then it dropped the woke crap because it's fan base started to walk away and... the fan base came back, and the rest of the season was great again... well it was good again, it was better than just about everything else again.

I just sort of wish the 80s nostalgia was more 80s nostalgia and note more what Millennials think is 80s | Intelligent and witty with a perfect seasoning of 80’s references.","Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Sadie Sink",1.0,True,6.0,2016.0

First of all it's super boring, especially first 4 seasons. It's so dragging that you will need some extra caffeine to keep up with it or you will fall asleep. Later it picks up a bit, but still suffers from lots of mistakes and one of them is a lack realism. It's very unrealistic. All the kids in this show seem very inteligent, saying deep & inteligent things that normally kids don't do, but in here miraculously they're all wise like adults. Characters all the time argue with each other, one moment hug, then next moment point a gun to each other. They also try to be all wise talking wise and etc...

This spin-off series feels like a rehashed casserole of old “The Walking Dead” plotlines, with an extra sprinkle of stale empowerment tropes that bludgeon you over the head rather than convince you of their authenticity. Don’t get me wrong: strong female leads can be amazing. However, this show’s approach to showcasing female strength feels less like a well-written narrative and more like a ham-fisted exercise in ticking boxes and making every male character look like they’re competing in a marathon of cluelessness.

From the moment the first episode staggers onscreen, “Fear the Walking Dead” seems utterly terrified—ironic, given the name—of allowing its men to be anything but incompetent or flat-out disposable. The female characters dominate every scenario, not by outsmarting equally clever male antagonists or allies, but by virtue of the writing force-feeding us lopsided characterizations. This kind of hackneyed scripting doesn’t highlight feminism; it cheapens it. Rather than craft complex individuals, the show often defaults to lazy stereotypes: men who can’t get their act together and women who correct every ill with an eye-roll and a scornful lecture. It’s less an ensemble and more a joyless, lopsided lecture on how to marginalize half of your cast.

Beyond its gender politics, let’s talk about the plot—or rather, the endless absence of one. The show recycles the same old survival tropes, shuffling from one dead-end location to the next, each encounter feeling like a bad rerun. The characters make bafflingly poor decisions that don’t feel organic or revealing but simply serve the writers’ need to keep a “conflict” going. It’s a never-ending cycle of nonsensical stand-offs, unnecessary melodrama, and forced moralistic moments that have all the subtlety of a zombie gnawing on a traffic cone.

As for the production value, it’s nothing to write home about. While AMC can deliver moody visuals and grimy sets like it’s nobody’s business, the show’s aesthetics are the best thing it has to offer—and that’s a pretty low bar. Even the action sequences feel repetitive and drained of creativity. It’s as if the camera operators got as bored as we did and just decided to press “record” on a carousel of random zombies. Meanwhile, dialogue is delivered with such contrived earnestness that you start to pity the actors. They’re good performers stuck in a narrative noose, forced to recite lines that do little more than remind you why you stopped caring three episodes ago.

In short, “Fear the Walking Dead” is the TV equivalent of stale bread. The show desperately wants to come off as progressive and edgy but ends up feeling like a shrill echo chamber of worn-out clichés and one-dimensional character dynamics. It’s about as innovative as a broken lawnmower and about as balanced as a three-legged chair. If you’re looking for a world brimming with nuance, character growth, or genuinely empowering storytelling for anyone (men or women), you won’t find it here. Instead, you’ll find a sloppy, man-bashing, condescending mess that fails to deliver meaningful tension or insight. Watch at your own risk, and maybe keep the remote handy so you can escape this undead snoozefest when it starts gnawing on your brain.","Lennie James, Kim Dickens, Colman Domingo, Danay García, Austin Amelio",0.0,False,0.0,2015.0

I never finished the second one as i write this.

I can easily say that Season 1 of this show was absolutely stunning. Some of the finest TV Crime hours of my life. We have Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in some of their best roles of their career. Especially the latter of them. McConaughey made the talk of the town with his role as the smart, and deeply intellect detective Cole and to be honest, i have rarely seen a role played out so well by an actor in years. He absolutely grabs you in and keeps you there for the entire show.

It is all set in the rural deep humid swamps of Louisiana. The photography here is top notch. It is shot in a way that you can actually smell the place while watching. It just brings you that close to the swamps of the south.

Featuring a great selection of music by T-Bone Burnett who scored Coen´s brothers ""O´Brother Where Art Though"" to critical acclaim. He is the number one man to bring in for some true Americana music to movie and TV projects. He seldom fails. It opened eyes to many new artists for me.

The show has a great momentum until the end. Somehow the end of the season, i felt, was very rushed and simplified. In my opinion, could been done smarter to justify the rest of the show. But that is just nitpicking. For why bother the rest of the show is near perfection in TV making and gives you so much to weigh in on. You should not miss it at all. It will leave you wanting to smell the swamps even more after the last episode.
Shame about Season 2 that was a bit of a disappointment to me. Although entirely unrelated to the Class-A first season.

This show has something going on for it that if it's for you, it'd take you to some different level of analyzing yourself and life altogether and if it ain't, then it's your bad luck I'd say.It just grips you from your soul; questions you on every single thing you believe in; plays with your emotions, thoughts; breaks you apart; gather the pieces back up and turns you into a different person.Still confused, aloof, lost, but a bit better I suppose. Everything linked with the show is a genius.The cast, even the tiniest of characters, the lingering music, the locations, the setting, the writing, the story, the direction, everything about it was just flawless.It didn't matter to me whether they were ever gonna solve the murders at all, but just the way the whole thing was building up, watching it all was plain bliss. Only watch this show if you have the taste for something dark, slow paced, deep, layered, intense, but satisfying and fulfilling.I haven't seen anything like this ever though in any genre.This is something that's gonna stay with you for a long long time. And hats off to Woody Harrelson ""Martin Hart"" and Matthew McConaughey ""Rust Cohle"" for giving us the pleasure of watching something like this..

A murder mystery set in small-town southern America, focusing on a dedicated cop who drinks too much, letting the case burrow under his skin and destroy his personal life as he chases answers across multiple time periods. But underneath, it's about more than that – it's about personal demons, good and evil, the soul, American identity, memory, time. And as the case progresses, a conspiracy slowly comes into focus. There may even be a supernatural element. Thus was the first season of _True Detective_. And thus is the third. With one major difference – season one was ground-breaking, one of the finest seasons of TV ever made, a defining early example of prestige TV. Season three, on the other hand, is, well…put it this way, of all the shows I've ever seen, season three of _True Detective_ is one of them.

Okay, okay, I'm being flippant. But there's no denying the similarities between seasons one and three. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing – I mean who would want a repeat of the horrendous and universally panned second season? So creator/writer/showrunner Nic Pizzolatto returning to his roots for the third outing is, on paper anyway, a good idea. The problem is that because this season is _so_ similar to season one, it's practically crying out for people to judge it in the light of those glorious episodes from 2014. And the contrast is not flattering.

This being _True Detective_, there is a lot to praise – the aesthetics are top-notch, the sense of place is palpable, the acting is off-the-chart brilliant. And there are some interesting themes – racial tension, journalistic ethics, marriage, fatherhood, the shadow of the Vietnam War, old age. But this being Pizzolatto unfettered, there's a lot to criticise too – the glacial pace, the under-written female roles, the cod-philosophy, the (toxic) machismo, the clichés, the dreadful finale. The fact is that Pizzolatto (a novelist by trade) needs an exceptional director to turn his ideas into something resembling brilliance, to imbue his relatively quotidian script with a portentousness well beyond the written word. He needs a director with a keen enough vision to mask the fact that his scripts are actually pretty by-the-numbers. Season three illustrates this beyond all doubt. Season one had the vision of Cary Joji Fukunaga (_Beasts of No Nation_, _Jane Eyre_, _Maniac_) who brilliantly directed all eight episodes, presenting a very thin story by way of such unforgettable and unsettling imagery that it made everything feel deeper and more profound than it really was. Season three has such a vision for two episodes; the first two, which are directed by Jeremy Saulnier (_Blue Ruin_, _Green Room_, _Hold the Dark_), who was also a showrunner until he abruptly departed after clashing with Pizzolatto (look out for a stunningly beautiful night-time shot of a search party walking through a field, torches moving in front of them – Sauliner gives the image a haunting fairy-tale-like quality). After these two episodes, directorial duties were split between Pizzolatto himself and journeyman TV director Daniel Sackheim. Season three without Saulnier (or Fukunaga) isn't as bad as season two, nowhere near, but it's still very weak, telling a threadbare story that it stretches out well beyond breaking point only to reward us with the limpest and most poorly written _dénouement_ you can possibly imagine.

The story is split over three time periods. In 1980, in the fictional backwater town of  West Finger, Arkansas, eight-year-old Will Purcell (Phoenix Elkin) and his twelve-year-old sister Julie (Lena McCarthy) go out to play on their bikes and fail to return. When the police are alerted, the case lands on the desk of Wayne Hays (an insanely good Mahershala Ali), a tracker during the Vietnam War, and one of those guys whose mind never really made it home from the jungle, and his partner Roland West (a superb Stephen Dorff). The kids' parents, Tom (a scene-stealing Scoot McNairy) and Lucy (a wonderfully contemplable Mamie Gummer), who hate one another, insist the kids wouldn't run away, and not long into the investigation, they are proven correct. Shortly thereafter, Wayne meets and forms a bond with the kids' English teacher, Amelia Reardon (Carmen Ejogo), who has her own reasons for pursuing the case. Ten years later, in 1990, Hays (now married to Amelia and with two children of their own) is working a dead-end desk job and West is a lieutenant. In the same week that Amelia's book about the case is being published, unexpected evidence comes to light that changes everything. The Purcell case is reopened and West is placed in charge of a special task force to look into it. And then, in 2015, Hays, now a widower suffering from memory loss, begins recording an interview on the case for a true-crime TV show, pushed into doing so by semi-unscrupulous journalist Elisa Montgomery (Sarah Gadon). Talking about the case, however, stirs something in him, and he determines to finally solve the mystery once and for all.

As with the first season, the use of multiple timelines muddies the narrative waters in a manner that wouldn't be possible were the story being told chronologically – the jumping back and forward means that sometimes we have a lot more information than the characters (in relation to the 1980 and 1990 timeline, we are seeing events in their future), but sometimes we have considerably less (in 2015, there are aspects of the case that we aren't privy to, but which the characters know all about). Especially laudable is how the show handles the time jumps, employing a variety of methods that serve to collapse the three different periods into one another. So, for example, a question asked of Hays apparently in 1990 is actually a question he's being asked in 2015, with the sound bridging the picture edit; a streetlight going out in 1980 cuts to a key-light going out in Hays's 2015 interview; a shot of Hays looking through a window in 1980, shows a reflection of his 2015 persona; a single-shot scene in a car depicts the characters repeatedly changing from 1990 to 2015 every time their face is off-screen. It's really well done, and carries thematic significance insofar as memory, particularly its subjectivity, unreliability, and mutability, is one of the main issues being examined throughout the season.

Also laudable is the old-age make-up by Michael Marino (_I Am Legend_, _Black Swan_, _The Irishman_), which is some of the best I've ever seen, and is complemented by an exceptional performance from Ali. He plays Hays differently in each of the three timelines, and it gives the character a believable arc – in 1980, he's driven, confidant, imposing;  in 1990, a sense of bitterness and indignation has crept in, he has a shorter temper and less tolerance for things of which he disapproves; in 2015, he's become a vulnerable and confused old man with just a hint of his past acerbity. It's a bravura performance from Ali, who really does carry the show on his shoulders. This is not to say the other performances are poor – Dorff is exceptional throughout, with his portrayal of West more uniform and unchanging than Ali's (which makes sense as West is more of a company man than Hays), and McNairy is heartbreaking in a somewhat thankless role (an interrogation scene in the sixth episode is worth looking out for). Ejogo is also excellent, although she's shackled by the poorly-written character she's playing, about whom Pizzolatto can't seem to make up his mind. Is she an exploitive opportunist or an empathetic journalist looking for the truth?

And aside from all this, there are some interesting thematic elements dotted throughout the show. Racial tension, for example, is never focused upon, but it's always in the margins, often unspoken. When Hays first meets Amelia (a black woman teaching white kids), he asks her ""_how is it here?_"", to which she replies, ""_it's fine. It's good really, for what it is. I hear something now and then. They're all poor around here; that's the main thing_."" Elsewhere, he refers to his ""_redneck radar_"" and points out to West that they belong to different _""tribes_"". Later he queries if West's promotion was related to his ""_pigmentation_"" and in 2015, Elisa asks him if he ever felt he was being racially discriminated against during the investigations. In another scene, he snaps at a well-intentioned West, ""_please explain to me the hardships and tribulations of being a white man in this country_"". The most direct engagement with race occurs when Hays and West go to question a black man, and tensions quickly rise. Although West points out, ""_we're not going to solve the racial complexities of our day in your front yard_"", the man still asks Hays, ""_how you gonna wear that badge?_"" to which he replies, ""_it's got a little clip-on_"". If only Pizzolatto could be that incisive yet subtle more often.

So if the aesthetics are good and the themes are reasonably well-handled, why is season three a dud? Well, for a few reasons. As already mentioned, it moves at an agonisingly slow pace, and without the visual gymnastics of someone like Fukunaga or Saulnier, the story can't sustain itself – it's stretched way beyond breaking point, lapsing into repetition and narrative strands that go absolutely nowhere. I'm loathe to say it's boring, as I think that's too negative a term, but my God, this story could have been told very efficiently in five episodes, not the indulgent eight Pizzolatto has taken. And yes, I know, it's not really about the murder-mystery, it's about the characters. I get that, and I accept that, and I celebrate any film or TV show which puts character before plot, but the characters here aren't very interesting, and they do an awful lot of moaning. There's certainly no Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) or Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson). Hell, there isn't even a Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell). Hays is brilliantly played, but he's as dull as dish-water, and the 1990-set problems between himself and Amelia, which come to take up an increasing amount of screen-time, are so uninteresting and self-serving, they're difficult to watch (especially when we're watching them have the same argument for the third time). The point is that large sections of the season drag interminably because neither the central mystery nor the main characters are engaging enough to sustain such a slow-moving plot

And then there's the finale. Good Lord. Okay, the finale of season one was weak. It was the episode when Fukunaga's smoke and mirrors cleared and allowed us to see that at the season's core was the tale of a serial killer paedophile. The conspiracy went nowhere, the philosophical musings went nowhere, the supernatural hints went nowhere, and the mythology (the Yellow King, black stars, Carcosa) all boiled down to a psycho living in the swamps who liked having sex with and killing children. It didn't ruin the season, but it was underwhelming. Season three's finale is about five times worse. It's so badly structured and written that I genuinely do not understand how it made it to screen unless there's no one willing to tell Pizzolatto that something isn't a good idea. About three-quarters of the way through the episode, with most of the season's questions still open, a character quite literally sits down and explains everything (and I mean everything). He walks us through every single event and answers almost every single question. It's horrid writing. To hell with the cardinal rule of writing for film or TV, ""show, don't tell""; here we have a finale with a 10-minute exposition dump right at its heart, which literally tells without showing. I don't know of a single criterion by which one can judge that decision a sound one. The last episode is insultingly bad. 

Despite disliking two of the three seasons of _True Detective_, I still consider myself a fan (the first season was that good). But it's starting to look more and more like that first season magic had more to do with the director than the writer. Pizzolatto just doesn't have a unique enough vision to raise the show above the competition, not when he's allowed creative _carte blanche_ anyway. Much like the first season, the mystery at the heart of season three was never as complicated nor as awe-inspiring as it initially seemed, but unlike season one, season three doesn't give us much else to latch onto. The story Pizzolatto is telling and the characters who inhabit it are too weak to support eight hours of narrative architecture. And, by God, that ending really annoyed me!

Season rating: 2.5/5 | Series 2: Below are my observations after watching series 1 a second time, so now I will briefly enter thoughts after rewatching Series 2. I can’t say I enjoyed much of this season. I should point out that it is great drama; it grabs you by the throat and moves you along through the river of violence and betrayal and prolific cursing. (I am known to drop an occasional F-bomb as are my friends and family, but if they all did it this much my Thanksgivings would be quiet ones without company). Plus I was hard-pressed to find people to root for here. The few I liked had little or no power and were, like me, just along for the ride. And I found it ironic that, populated with the modern flawed anti-heroes we get a lot in modern dramatic thrillers or cop shows, there seemed to be an old fashion tendency for arranging fit endings for characters, like a sprawling morality play. But this is typical HBO fare: rather addictive even as I grumbled about my minor complaints above.

Series 1: I recently re-watched the first series of True Detective many years after watching the first time. I don’t know if I will watch the subsequent two series again, and they are unrelated to the first series anyway, so each series should be reviewed separately.

So taking series one on its own, I found it to be great entertainment, despite the presence of a massive, walking and talking stereotype. I refer to one of the two lead detectives. Woody Harrelson’s detective Marty Hart is sort of a cliche character, straight out of many other police procedural mystery series. He checks off several boxes of that two-dimensional role: cheats on wife yet applies his violent double standard at the thought of her doing it, drinking too much, breaking the law to further his investigation, with his anger always near the surface. But I like Woody Harrelson and he does give a textured and layered performance, his sense of humor and how  he cares about the plight of people he encounters (except his family, of course), helped me forget much of the time how thinly drawn his character seemed.

Of course, Mather McConaughey’s character is the opposite: he is complex, always philosophizing, capable of violence when needed but always in control. They are the odd couple of detective partnerships and they are conversely always at odds with each other while still having each other’s back professionally.

The plot is suitably complex enough to maintain interest over eight episodes, though I found the subplot with the motorcycle gang almost felt like action filler material even though it ultimately advances the investigation. And I was vaguely disappointed in the ensemble cast, particularly the rest of the detective team. We learn nothing about them as they lumber through the scenes.

The women in the detectives’ lives are sporadically interesting when they stand up for themselves. I found myself wishing that McConoughey’s doctor girlfriend character would get expanded and filled in, but ultimately this series is about the two main men and how the actions of others affect them. And of course, being an HBO original, you have the prerequisite amount of sex and female nudity.

But season one is definitely compelling  viewing, in the way The Sopranos was, however much one similarly lamented the excessive violence involved. | True Detective: Night Country is a gripping and atmospheric thriller that takes the anthology series to new heights. Set in the remote and unforgiving Alaskan wilderness, the show follows two detectives who must overcome their personal and professional differences to solve a mysterious case that involves a missing research team, a severed tongue, and a possible connection to an unsolved murder of a native activist.

Jodie Foster delivers a stunning performance as Detective Liz Danvers, a hardened and cold cop who has been exiled to the small town of Ennis for her attitude and past failures. Foster portrays Danvers as a complex and flawed character who struggles with her own demons and regrets, but also shows glimpses of compassion and vulnerability. She is matched by Kali Reis, who plays Evangeline Navarro, a state trooper of Iñupiat descent who is obsessed with finding justice for the slain activist, Annie. Reis brings a fierce and fiery energy to Navarro, who clashes with Danvers over their methods and motives, but also develops a grudging respect and understanding for her partner.

The show is written and directed by Issa López, who creates a captivating and chilling vision of Alaska as a place of both isolation and freedom, beauty and danger, darkness and light. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the stark contrast between the snowy landscapes and the cozy interiors, the eerie silence and the sudden bursts of violence, the long night and the brief dawn. The soundtrack is also haunting, featuring a mix of native songs, folk tunes, and ambient sounds that enhance the mood and tension of the story.

The plot is intriguing and unpredictable, weaving together elements of crime, mystery, and supernatural horror. The show explores themes such as identity, culture, history, trauma, and redemption, as well as the environmental and social issues facing Alaska and its native people. The show also pays homage to the previous seasons of True Detective, with references and Easter eggs that fans will appreciate, but also stands on its own as a unique and original story.

True Detective: Night Country is a must-watch for fans of the genre and the series, as well as for anyone looking for a thrilling and immersive TV experience. It is one of the best shows of the year, and a worthy addition to the True Detective legacy. | True Detective is a series so far spanning four seasons.

### a matter of taste.

_Disclaimer: I haven't read the books._

You can re-cast characters, and play the same thing differently. That's OK.

The Reacher we get in the Tom Cruise variant is perceptive, clever, cautious; he relies on his wits and knowledge of human nature. He does what he thinks necessary and right, tends to avoid collateral damage. He's a loner, and perfectly fine with it.

The Reacher we get in the Alan Ritchson variant is a Hulk with penchant for killing; he leaves behind a trail of destruction and corpses. He pretends to be a loner, but is a lost team player in the end.

It's like James Bond versus the A-Team. Both enjoyable, similar topics, but very different in tonality and production.


One more aspect: the Cruise-Reacher is like a modern Yojimbo.
The Ritchson one is written like a power fantasy: invincible avenger walks through walls to right the wrongs.

Even if one ignores the fact that this show is supposed to be based on Tolkien's Legendarium and judges it as a stand-alone show, it is mediocre at best. | What is this supposed to be? Superficially, it looks like Tolkien's work but for me, that's where the similarities end.

Visually this is an impressive series.There are some genuinely talented actors in the cast, too. That said, Tolkien's work is, in every respect that truly matter's, absent.

Largely absent is the underlying message about courage,the battle between good and evil and the endless horror of war.

At least in this mini series.
For those unacquainted with the world of hobbits and elves and evil orcs in the works of Tolkien, Galadriel is a super talented elf of the highest order with mystic abilities in the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion.
She is a very charming and thoughtful character in Tolkien's books.
Here, she is a monster. Obviously, the intent is to goad people into thinking a monster can turn into a non monster.
But only the most naive fools buy into it. 
There is no motivation for Galadriel in her efforts here, but there isn't any motivation for most of the characters. 
The only way Galadriel's evil makes sense is if she was captured by the evil super being (a sort of second to the Devil) Sauron, and Sauron, a shape changer, took her place.
However, that didn't happen. It would have possibly saved this series to give some credible motivation.
Instead, we get the most contrived events possible.
That's why this is called a ""horribly written piece"". | ""And as I always say, since it sent most of J.R.R. Tolkien fans back to the legendary The Lord of the Rings books, the arrival of The Rings of Power can only be seen as a good thing"".

Read more (Greek content): https://www.depart.gr/lord-of-rings-rings-of-power-season-1-review/ | I have loved to see the imperfection, the weaknesses of characters like Galadriel and Sauron himself who are almost in their beginnings and it is logical that they have many weaknesses. I think the fandom that thinks negatively is wrong because they see Galadriel omnipotent and she is not at all, if something has shown both, Galadriel and Sauron, is that they have suffered many defeats and from there they grow and are forged as characters almost Gods to whom we have so much respect and admiration.

Many negative criticisms are subjective and lack of vision but we know what will happen, Sauron will win and achieve his goal by walking in the face of all, how it happens is what could be criticized but that Tolkien was basically what he wrote and I see it well executed in the series. | **Bad Fan-Fiction - could have been a mediocre fantasy show, but as a Middle Earth show it is a failure.**

I will just share some of my impressions and come to a conclusion.

The show is boring and does not pull you in. After watching the first 3 episodes, I am still not interested at all in what's going on.

Galadriel as an or maybe as THE main character of the show is miscast and badly written. She is supposed to be one of the most beautiful and graceful women of all Middle Earth and its history - but she comes across as bland and average in terms of charisma. And she is written as a very unlikable annoying arrogant person.

The casting in general: let's just say that a lot of casting choices do not represent Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth well. The writers and producers seem to not understand the idea of a fully independent fantasy world that is based on its own history and evolution and not the history and evolution of our world. It has to be coherent in itself and not represent our modern day world - that's why it's called ""Fantasy"". Especially when it comes to the fantasy world of Tolkien's ""Middle Earth""! And by inserting the modern day society conditions and ideology into the world of ""Middle Earth"" the makers of this show make this show look less like ""Middle Earth"" and more like our modern day world, which Tolkien Fans certainly don't want to be inserted and represented in a show about ""Middle Earth"".

Elves appear more like kind of Romans, they do not look and feel like Tolkien elves. Giving them short haircuts is a bad decision and an example for how the makers of this show made the Elves more like humans with pointy ears than real Elves that are a different people. Bad casting choices (see explanation above) there, too. Also, for some reason there are aged-looking elves in the show, though elves are not supposed to be aging to the point that they look like old people.

The dialogues (and monologues) are often cringe and stupid - they often try hard to sound poetic, but lack substance and talent on the side of the writers.

In some regard the show is more like ""Dungeons & Dragons"" meets ""Middle Earth"" than actual ""Middle Earth"".

Visually, the show is often just a cheap uninspired copy of the aesthetics of the Peter Jackson movies. You can see the money they put in, but you can't see true inspiration or authentic artistic vision there.

It doesn't do the show any good that it is not based on any stories actually written by Tolkien, but only on some references from the ""Appendices"" and it just uses some characters from ""The Hobbit"" and the Ring Trilogy. So this show tells a story with which the (seemingly rather talentless) writers came up themselves which feels like bad fan-fiction (which is essentially truly is).

Bottom Line/Conclusion: It could have worked as some fantasy TV show that is not based on Tolkien's works - for people who get along with this vision (inspired a lot by certain ideology and modern day conditions) of a fantasy world. I personally would have perceived such a show somewhat polished, but essentially mediocre and accordingly would have been my rating; and then I would have ignored the show for the rest of its lifetime. But as this show is supposed to represent ""Middle Earth"" from the according works of Tolkien, one simply has to acknowledge and point out that it is a big failure. The majority of Tolkien fans reject this bastardization of Tolkien's source material, and they do this for good reasons.","Charlie Vickers, Morfydd Clark, Robert Aramayo, Charles Edwards, Owain Arthur",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

It's rather bare knuckle, vigilante grittiness really broke the candy covered shell, that encases so many comic book hero's.

Sadly in spite of strong stories and mature characterizations for me this show slowly started a downward spiral, gradually exchanging its originality for mainstream complacency. 

What really ruined things, in my view, was the migration of the character from a kind of anti hero to a politician. As if this wasn't bad enough, a thread of brittle and downright tiresome, lecturing political correctness crept in too. 

The result was bland, predictable, opinionated and uninteresting. What a shame. 4/10 from me. | It has been a great 8 year journey with this show.
When I first began watching season 1, I had my skepticism, but halfway through it it got more interesting, and over the years it became...something else!

From heart stomping action to a great cast - especially when it featured nearly all the main cast from the Spartacus series! And even epic crossovers
This show will be missed. | MobieGuys summed it up beautifully: https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5ca169649251411a18088d77

Seasons 1 to 4 were a solid 9 out of 10... and each season after that was worse. I didn't even watch season 8. Couldn't bring myself to do it | IF you only watch the first few seasons it's pretty good. It actually starts off decent enough, and had they kept on that track I'd give it 10 stars.

But, unfortunately, it spiraled into CW trash pretty fast and what was once a decent and gritty superhero show ala Grell, it quickly turned into Smallville meets The Dating Game.

As the show progresses, it becomes more and more muted, more and more toned down, and the gritty darkness that made it good fun turned into shallow CWness.

Nothing wrong with that, if you find that sort of thing to be entertaining. Perhaps it's because we're talking about the creator of Family Guy, American Dad and A Million Ways to Die in the West. Maybe that set my funny bone's expectations too high but the guy is indeed hilarious and I suppose that was the standard I was hoping for.

In any case, this comes off more as pure homage to Star Trek with a little sprinkling of humour here and there. I gave it a chance with three episodes. I'll give it another chance with the fourth episode but if that doesn't tickle me pink, well, this series will be off my list. | Don't be fooled by the trailer, this is not a comedy show. Sure, it's a little off-beat and more reminiscent of Firefly than Star Trek. It doesn't reinvent anything though and rather uses a lot of things present in similar shows.

The crew is interesting and so are their missions. The images are quite breath-taking and of course the story has new elements to it, but it is the same ""righteous"" and ""just"" series with a health dose of self-reflection.
But two cliches do stand out: cocky alien males, and very mechanical and condescending androids, 

What they really did wrong though was mess with time-travel for more than an episode. It has been nearly every show's downfall and this is no exception. Season 2 is as far as I recommend going unless they pull a rabbit out of their hat and completely stop messing with time. | 100% Star Trek with retards. Sure, it's too dumb to make it for a license into the franchise. 

The good part, it makes the Kirk 60s show shine, even the acting in the old series is better.

And the special effects would look great compared with Next Generation's first season. But not noticeable better than the later seasons. | Amazing to see a couple of low reviews here. THIS SHOW IS STAR TREK. This show has heart and especially HOPE and WONDER; like actual Star Trek, not the new dystopian, hopeless, bleak, ideologically-skewed ""Star Trek"" shows now, which are filled with propaganda and gaslightng. And Episode 9 of Season 2 was one of the most amazing space battles I've ever laid eyes upon on screen, TV AND movies. Amazing. Not many shows today make you feel good, normal, hopeful—this one does. | Season one and two of The Orville were excellent and then along bumbled season three.....

Season three is everything I associated with the new Star Trek franchise.Woke, poorly written, cynical and frankly irritating and boring, in equal doses. 

I'm no longer sure how to rate this once well written, funny and generally likeable, show. Suffice to say, if season three is the direction of things, I hope its the last one.

5/10 factoring in seasons one and two. I found three so bad, I wont even attempt to rate it on its own but it does pull down my overall rating, significantly. | I originally rated this show 8/10 after watching seasons 1 & 2.
I have started watching season 3... which was a long time coming and I was really hanging out for it... I have just watched S03E05 'A Tale of Two Topas' and the first thing I did was up my rating to 9/10.
Season 3 was totally worth waiting or. I particularly love the way that the stories are carrying on from season 1 & 2 events.
I truly hope there is a season 4!!
When the series started it was too forced with the comedy moments. They were not natural, and some were to the point of being cringe-worthy. But as season 1 progressed, it became more serious and in my opinion, it became a much better program.
I don't consider there to have been a bad episode. Sure, some are better than others, but none are bad.
There is drama, action, comedy (but no longer cringe-worthy)... the stories are totally engaging and cover worthwhile topics and ethical quandaries.

I don't watch a lot of US entertainment these days. I did however, grow up watching my share of Stallone action films, so a dash of nostalgia and curiosity, drew me in. 

There's nothing terribly original by now about the plot of Tulsa King. Its  Mafia style antics are noting new. I think it was a smart move, playing this as a dark comedy. It fits the well worn character, Stallone, inhabits. 

That said, I guess the key question is, is it entertaining? I'd say ""sort of"". I like seeing Stallone back on the small screen. Regrettably, thus far and I appreciate its early days, the story is a little basic. Even for a comedy, it stretches credulity at times and lacks an intelligent wit and charm, that would have rendered it, more appealing.

The first few seasons are, for the most part, extremely fantastic, focused, funny, fresh, intelligent and even at times, brilliant. Most importantly, it offers something that separates it from the pack...Must see TV!

**What this review sounds like now nearing the end of the shows run.**

A once great show which slowly starts to diminish around season 4, unfortunately. By the 9th season it seems as though the pen and paper have been handed over to teenage fans of the show...Decent background noise.

**To conclude.**

This show was once incredible, and something fresh, even at times brilliant. I couldn't wait for each new episode. Now, I watch it when it becomes available on a streaming service, and, on rare occasion you get a great episode, but it's not worth devoting a weekly schedule and sitting through all the fan-fiction episodes and story lines to get to the good stuff. The show can still be enjoyable, without question, though I find it better suited as background noise while doing work instead of must see TV that you're excited to tune in as it airs each week. It's now just another average sitcom which has been dumbed down for the masses quite considerably. At this rate, the show will probably end with Penny having Sheldon's child to fulfill the most commonly seen teenage fan-fiction. | I did not start watching this sitcom until the show end3d, but I had the good fortune to watch the episodes of all 12 seasons in order. I don’t agree with another review I saw that said the show had slipped over time. Rather, it is a consistently great show, as all of Chuck Lorre’s efforts seem to be, sort of comedy’s answer to Aaron Sorkin’s dramas.

Mind you, I had some minor issues with it. I really got tired of Sheldon’s attitude and antics, but that 2as counterbalanced by the slow and careful ways he also showed character growth. Similarly, all of the characters exhibited realistic growth in their attitudes and behavior. The writing was usually strong, even during the few shows that I would classify as clunkers— plots that didn’t work for me. I am impressed that the show never jumped the shark, but rather stayed true to itself. Some long running shows can’t resist doing it, such as when Happy Days changed the Fonz from a cool dude to a combo superhero/cartoon character who could do almost anything, it seemed.

Funny, I have a friend who told me she couldn’t watch it due to the canned laugh track, so I was amused to learn there was no laugh track as the show was filmed in front of a live audience. Imagine that!","Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar",1.0,True,10.0,2007.0

My wife watched the entire set of series without me as it seemed we already had a lot to watch together. She enjoyed it and at some point I decided to watch it and she elected to watch it again with me. 

It is very witty and intelligent and, if you don’t mind every episode using the same wit and rapid fire word association and social references on and on, it is great fun. Once in a while they take it a bit too far and a character who has not shown great wit and humor comes out with a jewel. I can understand the writers wouldn’t want to waste the line.

They have two Sam and Diane characters (Lorelai and Luke) as a “will they or won’t they” romance — you know, from the tv show Cheers where they bend every script to bring them close to a romance, but oh, not quite. A lot of shows have done it since then (and probably before also. I mean they kept Mary Tyler Moore single as Mary Richards because she had dome the housewife thing in the Dick Van Dyke Show).

The show does really well at staying consistent, especially considering how many episodes there were each season. So even when it wears a bit thin for me, (for example, the Kurt character really gets old for me as they seem to have him do absolutely everything a minor guess character could do better. Did they not want to pay character actors?) it is still better than most shows out there. 

I feel I should add that I usually wait until I have watched the entire run of a show before reviewing it, because sometimes even good programs deteriorate or jump the shark. You know, when  show does something totally out of character or unbelievable to boost ratings or juice it up. Apparently the term came from the long-running Happy Days when the Fonz was water skiing and literally jumped over a shark. He almost took on super powers, it seemed.

A lot felt forced, stiff, and didn't have enough suspension of disbelief (that magic touch). But it was good enough to keep me watching and liking it more as it went on. I didn't like the puzzle of events though. Can't wait for a fan edit putting events in sequential order. Just that thing that is hard to put into words. You feel it is all fake whether it is acting, timing, camera work, wire work, choreography or what not. Closer to Shannara chronicles than Game of Thrones in suspension of disbelief. Or World of Warcraft (the movie) rather than Lord of the Rings. | I finished watching The Wicher at one go straight, so it is evident that it kept me hooked until the very end. Let me be clear about something: I am not much of a fan of these medieval sagas. But something about The Witcher struck me as different.

Yes, there are many flaws. The acting of the supporting cast is not very strong, the storyline is a bit obvious, and sometimes things happen too conveniently for the story to progress.

But the good things certainly dominate the bad things. The ""Dunkirk approach"" to the editing mostly worked well, even though ambiguity remained at certain places. I guess those will be cleared in the second season. Henry Cavill was magnificent as the titular character. The dialogues were very strong too, thanks to its source material.

The pace of the series was strong, and it picked up interest as the episodes rolled by. I, personally, preferred this over the Game of Thrones (I know I am going to get a lot of flak for this), but hey, choices, right? | Solid series. One flaw, that kept it from getting 5 stars, is how the show deals with the multiple timelines in Season 1. It could have definetly been handled better. I am looking forward to future seasons. | the timeline is the critical issue in this show.
it is not consistent in the last two episodes how comes that after syntra distruction the girl spent more than 4 days walking around the continent while the Witcher maybe 2 days before the event I do not want to spoil.
Dialogues are an issue too..: I do not like  the millenial slang in a show that take place in a medieval/fantasy time.
Donza. | Wow!

The Witcher was a thrilling Netflix series, with stunning special effect, superb choreographic fight scenes and a great cast.
Henry Cavill wa awesome as Geralt.

Though I was feeling confused with the different timelines for each episode, I did understood why, and it finally brought us all to speed on the last 2 episodes. 

Can't wait for series 2 to come. | I originally watched this in 2019 when it released and was a big fan,
 the world was captivating and interesting yet bleak and grounded. Such 
was my interest, I shortly after played all the games and began reading 
the books, now two years later and with season 2 about to come out I 
decided it was worth a rewatch. 



On my second watch I wasn't quite as impressed, now able to judge the
 show both as an adaptation of material, characters and stories I was 
familiar with from other works and also able to better analyse the show 
as a piece of television in its own right now that I could better 
understand the  quite convoluted plot and timeline. 



The Show is an attempt to adapt two collections of short stories that
 serve as precursors to the main witcher series, these stories are often
 only loosely connected although are often thematically related and take
 place over a huge span of time and place.

This could lend itself nicely to an anthology style monster of the week collection with common themes, characters and world building however the The show ambitiously tries to construct a cohesive narrative out of this in 8 episodes and it doesn't really quite work, limited to only 8 episodes so much subtlety and intricacy is lost and that which is there, is often poorly explained. I  blamed myself on my initial watch for often being confused at what was 
happening but now after watching again while familiar with the source 
material I don't feel the show really does a good job of setting up the 
political background and bounces from one extreme to another either name
 dumping with no context or flanderization such as Nilfgaard = Nazis.



I would never expect a Movie or Tv show to be able to capture or 
match everything from a book series where the only limit is the readers 
imagination but was very surprised how I much preferred nearly all the 
voice acting and  visual aesthetics of the video games compared to the 
show, from the creature design to the Nilfgaardian armour to the sense 
of character I think the games does it all better. The acting here 
overall isn't great, although I do like Cavil as Geralt. 



Overall I still think the first season was decent and I did still 
enjoy it  and hopefully pretends better to come but can't say it 
particularly succeeds either as an adaption of the first two witcher 
books or as a particularly well crafted piece of television. | My rating is 3/5. If you think wooow unbelievable this part, you are absolutely wrong. because I feel that some boring episodes here. | I'm not big fan of fantasy movies or shows but I started to watch and it was pretty good. But then it came second season and it was terrible. Third is also not good and its more about side actors than Whitcher itself. Also it became another woke trash that I hope was not in the book. Also, except from main character acting is not good also, especially two women side actors. I gave it rather high score of 6 just because of first season, but otherwise it would be 3 or 4. You know what, just after this review I will give it 5 because as I write this I came to realize it did not deserve more. Like so many possibly good movies and shows today, ruined by woke stuff. | The first season was going really great. But by season two, they altered the story from the book so much and completely ruined this Polish piece of art. | Cast is the biggest turn off for this show. They completely changed characters for their political agenda which ruins whole atmosphere of the Witcher series and kills desire to watch this series. Woke propaganda in its finest shape! Sorry, but I don't want to watch propaganda, I just wanted to watch series of one of my favorite video games and book. This is complete abomination and crap. Here you get 1/10 ratings from me for ruining Witcher series for us. | The first season was pretty good in my opinion. It was not perfect because of the confusing timeline and some poor casting choices (Fringilla in particular). But at least it followed the story of the books.

But season 2 hurts. The writers of the show are rewriting the story unnecessarily, and it turns out much worse than the original material. Except for episode 1, the writers of this show simply do not understand what makes The Witcher world interesting. The Deathless Mother is boring, the brief glimpse of the Wild Hunt is boring and out of a million creepy and original monsters, the series finale has them fighting a bunch of velociraptors, because this is apparently Jurassic Park.

And while Henry Cavill isn't doing so great in the role of Geralt, I can hardly blame him, considering the bad dialogue writing overall. Freya Allan as Ciri is the best thing in this series. And to think that they almost didn&#39;t cast her just shows how out of touch the producers of this show are.

Just follow the books, and maybe this series can be saved.

Edit: Season 3 is such a trainwreck, it doesn't even deserve a review. | **The Witcher: A Captivating Journey Through a Rich Fantasy World**

_The Witcher_ has consistently delivered a spellbinding experience across its three seasons, effectively introducing a credible and realistic fantasy world where the lines between good and bad are often blurred. The series masterfully brings to life the rich characters, sharp wit, and stylish action that fans of the novels and games have come to love.

From the very beginning, the production design stands out, with a commitment to creating an atmosphere steeped in medieval fantasy. The music enhances this immersion, wrapping you in a world that feels both ancient and alive. The actors, particularly Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, fully commit to their roles, embodying their characters with a depth and authenticity that is rare in fantasy television.

Season one lays a strong foundation with its non-linear narrative, offering an exciting, intoxicating, and at times, downright confusing ride that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. As the series progresses, it continues to balance action, drama, humor, and the darker aspects of its world-such as sex and monsters-creating a rich tapestry of storytelling that is both fun and engaging.

By the time we reach Geralt and Ciri's latest outing, the series has evolved into a spectacular odyssey of family and destiny. Set within a world brimming with history and political schemes, their journey is as much about the bonds they forge as it is about the epic battles they fight.

_The Witcher_ remains a must-watch for fans of the genre, offering something for everyone, whether you're drawn to its intense action scenes, its deeply human characters, or its richly detailed world. Each season builds on the last, delivering a thrilling and cohesive adventure that leaves viewers eagerly anticipating what comes next.","Henry Cavill, Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan, Joey Batey, MyAnna Buring",0.0,False,0.0,2019.0

lights out,"Lights Out was an extremely popular American old-time radio program, an early example of a network series devoted mostly to horror and the supernatural, predating Suspense and Inner Sanctum. Versions of Lights Out aired on different networks, at various times, from January 1934 to the summer of 1947 and the series eventually made the transition to television.

In 1946, NBC Television brought Lights Out to TV in a series of four specials, broadcast live and produced by Fred Coe, who also contributed three of the scripts. NBC asked Cooper to write the script for the premiere, ""First Person Singular"", which is told entirely from the point of view of an unseen murderer who kills his obnoxious wife and winds up being executed. Variety gave this first episode a rave review (""undoubtedly one of the best dramatic shows yet seen on a television screen""), but Lights Out did not become a regular NBC-TV series until 1949.","Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Crime, Drama, Reality",5.3,5.453832828921485,1.0986122886681098,False,Ended,1.0986122886681098,5.081404364984463,3.4011973816621555,No platforms available,No reviews,Jack La Rue,0.0,False,0.0,1949.0

And even the time travel aspect is mystical, there is _no_ sci-fi element here.  _LOST_ it ain't.  If that changes past season one, well, I guess I might enjoy it more, but that's was my primary reason for giving the show a go, and my wife is enjoying this a lot more than I am.  Can't get enough of it. For me, it's pretty meh, and this is more of a warning for the guys than a proper review.

The show is 99% fish-out-of-water story of a feisty modern (well, from 1945 anyway) Englishwoman nurse , Claire Randall (played by Caitriona Balfe), who is sent back to 18th century Scotland by some mumbo-jumbo druidic magic after touching a runestone.  The theme is _heavy_ on a Harlequin-esque romance between the two leads, Claire and Jamie Fraser (played by Sam Heughan).  There's some fighting, almost as much boobies as Game of Thrones, and gore that may keep the guys interested, but this show is mostly going to appeal to women I think.

(This may be a spoiler, but there is also a FAR too long drawn-out guy-on-guy homoerotic torture arc that I really hated.  And, aside from the lead, a lot of the men depicted are pretty horrible.)

I think the historical costume-drama aspect of it is pretty interesting, I know a fair amount more about 18th century Scotland than I used to (which was pretty much nothing).  So, if you like that kind of stuff, you might like this.  Honestly though, I think having a POV of a modern woman kind of muddles the historical aspect a bit.  I liked Downton Abbey better if that helps (yes I know, different time period, but I think handled the period piece costume drama aspect better, even with all the soap opera tropes), so that may say something. | The 1st season was great... the 2nd season was okay... then it just gets silly.
My suspension of disbelief was in overdrive and soon burnt out. | Amazing show. Interesting story. Well developed characters & most importantly no cancer woke culture garbage & propaganda.

It's a television show that delivers mystery, drama, comedy, suspense and weirdness in a way that only a handful of television programs have done. It might be the most effective 'mainstream' David Lynch vehicle of all time. The story is based in an alternate reality that parodies classic daytime soap-operas that had been popular during the nineteen-eighties. But it doesn't really parody them. More, it pays homage. The stereotypical characters mimic the same beats of actors appearing in shows like _Days of Our Lives_ or _As the World Turns_. 

David Lynch and Mark Frost show that they are masters of manipulating the emotions of the audience. _Twin Peaks_ delivers supernatural storylines and plot-devices with a flair that leaves the viewer confused and uncomfortable. It elicits feelings from its spectators. This is the mark of good quality media. It's what makes _Twin Peaks_ one of my favorite programs. 

The characters are identifiable, intriguing and unforgettable. One of the biggest draws to Twin Peaks is their character development. This isn't just a story about a girl that is killed and wrapped in plastic. No. This is a collection of various stories that weave around one and other. From our friend Sheriff Harry Truman and his relationship to Josie. To the adventures of Audrey Horn, Super Sleuth. To the exploits of Bobby, Shelly and the comatose Leo Johnson.

But the most unforgettable character is our central one. The hero, FBI Agent Dale Cooper. A role perfectly played by Kyle MacLachlan. He also happens to the the main character. The focus. Agent Cooper has been assigned to the Laura Palmer murder case in the small town of Twin Peaks. His introduction to the town mimics our own in an strangely positive light. This makes Agent Cooper a perfect host to an otherwise depressing feature. His uplifting nature is infectious not only to the story but also to the audience. I can also identify with his notorious love of Cherry Pie and Coffee. 

To say that the storyline meanders is a bit of an understatement. The overarching story is about a small-town girl that was murdered by an unknown killer. The FBI had been brought in to investigate, but that is where things go awry. We get Aliens, Logs, Supernatural Events, Possessions, Incest, Betrayal, Physical Transformations, Teleportation, Alternate Realities and The Yakuza all presented in a bizarre way that still leaves you wanting more. To make things even more enticing. I like to think of this world not only being expanded out into the Revival show on Showtime (2017) or the film, _Fire Walk With Me_ but also an extension of Lynch's film _Lost Highway_.

The weirdness is what makes Twin Peaks so memorable. When David Lynch is involved, it's not just frivolous silliness. Everything is a metaphor. For the most part. I think. Maybe. This weirdness carries the show into some really dark and scary places. That again is something that makes the series so gripping.

If you're a fan of David Lynch's work then this is perfect for you. If you're a film student. If you're a fan of gripping television. Watch _Twin Peaks_! It gets weird, but that's just par for course. Some people have criticized the show for going too far off the rails. It had been viewed as boring too. But its a show for people that really want to sit down and enjoy something. It's not a Michael Bay produced explosion picture and that might turn off a good deal of typical viewers. Stick with it and you will get stories presented in a world that has genius elements of noir, horror and drama.",Kyle MacLachlan,1.0,False,0.0,1990.0

The writing, directing, and cinematography of Star Trek are top-notch, even by today's standards. On par with more recent series like Battlestar 2004. 

From the top writers and directors of science fiction of that era, sophisticated storylines across the series deal with challenging topics that are risqué even today. Star Trek was radically ahead of its time in the 60’s having a multi-racial main cast including things like non-white character’s and women holding officer positions in Starfleet (unheard of at that time and for decades after)

Warning: Some female characters wear mini-skirts (a fade in the 60’s). Some creatures had campy costumes (state of the art in the 60’s).

I was told that it's a great TV show, a bit slow, but would get better and to not give up… So I started watching it and episodes were very dull. I was dragging with it. So shallow, so dull, so boring... None of the characters seem to be interesting. Same can be said about plot. Episodes were so dull that I was almost falling asleep. They were so uninteresting that I didn't even remember them. Production seemed cheap too with the same locations… It felt like that whole show was shot in one room. 

I tried to not give up, I tried it hard and made it to whole one season, but now I'm giving up to continue watching this crap show & I regret that I wasted my precious time on it. And I'm not one of those people who dislike SCI-FI. I liked Prometheus a lot, I liked Alien a lot and I like some good SCI-FI movies, but this TV show isn't definitely of them. | The Expanse is an adaptation of a series of novels by James S. A. Corey, the pen name of the two authors who co-write the book series.

This series adheres to the books quite well, though it isn't one-novel-per-episode, more like one novel per season.

All of that aside, this is an excellent series.  The characters are believable in their setting of a mostly-corporate-controlled future.  The pacing is a bit iffy in the first few episodes, but by and large it isn't a problem and it does get better a few episodes in.

The setting is this:

There's Earth, whose government is torn with some seeking to control or best the government of Mars and the emerging government of the Belt.

There's Mars, who consider themselves pretty autonomous (and they are), and who are bent upon a generations-long project to terraform Mars so that men don't have to live under domes.

There's the Belt, which basically includes people in the asteroid belt and beyond.

If that amount of political upheaval isn't enough, something new is coming... | Let me just say this: read the books instead, but watch the show immediately afterwards? The production was beset by issues, dropped by SyFy and picked up by Amazon, then a key actor committed assault and the show was diverged to adapt for his absence, and when the Amazon bucks ran out the last season collapsed without delivering. The source material is great, vast geopolitical space opera with a micro lens through political intrigue, detective stories and the established trope of a tiny ship's crew falling in over their heads. Besides the production issues, I found that while the rest of the cast was excellent, Holden's character was played poorly, and his development didn't really come across without knowledge of the books. While the plot suffers from the production constraints, the story still feels exciting and it's fun to puzzle out which patois the Belter lingo is borrowing from at any given time. I can only wish they had a few more seasons to work with, but that's television as a medium... | **One of the best Sci-Fi shows ever made!**

Oye! First time viewer? Make sure to make it to the episode 4 ""CQB"".

About the books: Yes, they are fantastic. The show is also fantastic. It's okay to like both even if they aren't the same.

A note on other reviews here: I'm surprised by all of the negativity in the other reviews considering how overwhelmingly positive the show has been received and reviewed on other sites. As Beltalowda say, Xetamang tili du xeta.

I'm going to be intentionally vague here:
There are several elements at play in the show. One arc of the first season focuses on the mystery of a missing person and a detective's journey finding out what happened to her. The second focuses on who's responsible for a ship that was destroyed. A third focuses on a dangerous and valuable substance that was found, and a fourth that focuses on the political climate of the solar system while certain events trigger tension between Earth, Mars, and The Belt. 

The first and second mysteries are solved in the first season, but the rest evolve and grow throughout the rest of the series. The series has a diverse cast of strong characters without resorting to the usual lazy denigration that other series' and movies have latched onto lately. There's just enough attention to scientific detail to make the show feel grounded (thrusters on the back of turrets to counter rotation while firing), while still leaving enough to the imagination to be awe inspiring. There's a depth to The Expanse's universe that is intoxicating.

The Belter Creole language made by a linguist that you can actually learn on memrise (yes, really) illustrates this perfectly.

It is not! Truly this would have been the end the show deserved had this been the final episode.

Apparently it was written as such until the show was renewed BUT with most of the cast moving on contractually already! Yes, a wrap around\ tag on scene\tale opens the show up to an all new reset of the beginning, only with a now adult Henry being approached by his unknown to him daughter (about the same age Henry was when he found Emma in ep 1 season 1)! She says he must go with her cause ""his family needs him"". Sound familiar? It would seem Henry, like Emma in that ep, is clueless and so another forgetting spell was cast. Or whatever!

For those who do not know, the next season will no longer have the following characters\actors: Emma Swan, Snow White, Prince Charming, Belle, young Henry, and I am sure I am forgetting one other. The core will be the now adult Henry, Hook, Gold, and the evil queen\not evil anymore.

How the show intends to carry on or explain where everyone missing has gone (yes there was a time jump in the tag on scene of several years) will be interesting to see, but I frankly have little hope for the continued success of the show. It was all about Emma, Snow, Charming, and how everything revolved around them. Without those characters I think it will be a rebooted show trying to be it's old self but simply unable to.

I mean everyone is together, happy, sitting down to a thanksgiving like meal in this ep's natural end! Somehow along the way all that is torn apart? Is the ultimate lesson learned to be that there are no happy endings or happy beginnings because even in a fantasy world life sucks? Crap happens to the best of people regardless of what they have overcome to get to a place of stability?

But I think this was Disney related and Warner Brothers own the rights to all things DC. So legally I think they were forced to make something vastly different.

The thing is that it looked like they were going for a Fables story, and because of that some obvious plot threads kind of dropped off in the 1st season when it looked like they were getting too close to the comic for litigious safety

And then it kind of tapered off tangentially before catching it's footing halfway through and falling apart at the end because it ran too long | I didn't get to the end of season 1 before I lost interest.

**SEASON 01:****

I was not sure to give it a try, in the end I just went on. The reason was, another dystopian theme. It was a short season with the 10 episodes, and I've got a mixed feeling. It was based on the 30 year old novel of the same name. I mean 3 decades old source is very old in the present trend. Since that book there were plenty of films, series were made similar to that theme, including one feature film adaptation. I don't know the screenplay was highly borrowed from its original source, but all I expected was alterable.

Even though I felt familiarity, I enjoyed watching it. My issue was the drag. The whole season was a drag. Dragged to have one more season, or maybe more in the future. Especially I was very disappointed with the season finale. It only felt like a mid-season finale and yet a lot more to come in the same season. But that was only my assumption, this season ended at the halfway. They had held back too much to have some of it in the upcoming seasons. That's very intense move from the production perspective, but for the viewers, it left with unsatisfying.

The plus points were the casting and production. Elisabeth Moss was very good. Her expressions saved in parts of the earlier episodes. Particularly, her smile during those circus were going on, instead of being tensed and confused. That reveals the character, who wants to stay alive for a reason. As the story progresses in the next episodes, you would know more reasons why. Alexis' part was short, as well as many others. The overall the characters design was good. But I anticipated more from the story side to reveal.

In the near future, the humans had lost fertility capacity, excluding a very few men and women. Those who are capable of having babies are taken as slave surrogate mothers, after separating from their husbands and kids, to assign them those who desire to have children. This tale follows Offred, who is one of the maids. Her struggle against the couple who took her in, and overall society, how it treated her and others like her. The American dreams are gone. Many fled to Canada and yet some are trying to make it there. But Offred is not concerned about that. She now has to find her daughter before planning anything.

Each epidoe was decent, but only a couple of them were top class. At least now we know what to expect from the follow-up season. Also the perspective of the story was very restricted like everything was from Offred. The episode like 'The Other Side' really made it interesting. We need more those kind of explanation of what's going on on the other side. Especially for a television series, they have all the time to detail out from all the angle. That's what I like in the series, otherwise I'm always a film fanatic, love to watch short and sweet tales. So I'm waiting for the season 2.

_7/10_ | The Show is great! i will admit when my wife said i have a show we should watch i thought what is this? but after the first episode I was hooked. 
I recommend this show but it is quite confronting and if you have trouble with that type of thing it may not be for you. | Every now and then a production comes along that such an absolute gem, it has you lost for words.

A Handmaids Tale, is based on the novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood . I have not yet read the book but if this series is anything to go by, it will, I'm sure, make its way into my collection very soon.

On the surface the premise behind the series seems novel. Yet when you consider the fate of women in contemporary and historic theocratic societies, its not so far fetched. Indeed, what Atwood has rather cleverly done, is transplant aspects of life in theocratic societies, most notably Medieval Europe and Puritan colonial America, into a futuristic setting using civil war as a vehicle. A biological imperative is introduced too, in the form of pollution induced human sterility. Fertile women in Gilead (formerly the USA) are reduced to human incubators, their only imperative to produce children.

On face value, this might seem to be a story about the subjugation and commoditization of women. Indeed, it is that. Yet, what this series is ultimately about is the hypocrisy of intolerance. Not just women but any individual or group, who diverge from the rigid religious script, meet a grim fate. Meanwhile, those controlling the dialogue, are more or less free to make and break their own rules, as they see fit. Even those who do follow the societal script, often do so for reasons that are in opposition to those they claim to uphold.

For my money everything about this series is superb. Elizabeth Moss is a wonderful, off beat choice, for Offred the handmaid to a powerful commander, who is directly responsible for hers and others suffering. Joseph Fiennes, is capable in the role of the superficially charming but emotionally empty commander.

Update: Yes a decent series but, for my money, its run on too long and now simply appears to be recycling the original script with a few twists and turns. At times, in my opinion, perilously close to looking like misandry, too. 

In short, an engrossing, thoughtful and engaging series but it needs to come to a close, as it no longer has much more to say, that has not already been said.  | This is one messed up TV show; about a dystopian America ruled by a misogynistic government.

Elizabeth Moss' performance though was pretty good.

While I don't condone the mistreatment of women in the series, I do praise it for popularity nonetheless.

I wonder what the conclusion of the show will be like? | People are going to look back at the Censorship decade and think that this and Harry Potter are the only two books the cancel culture freaks read...

... and then realize that they were both adapted for the screen.

This was good when they made it for HBO in the 1990s when it had an actual plot and was actually pro-Atwood.

Only the people that made this turned on Atwood during #MeToo when she spoke out in favor of Due Process and then it slowly started to distance itself from her IP... as it became more and more in your face political.

And that is when things like this lose me. | Stupid liberal leftist show where conservative people are vilified as some monsters while those ""innocent"" leftist liberals are portraited as victims and funny thing is that in reality it's the opposite.","Elisabeth Moss, Yvonne Strahovski, Ann Dowd, Madeline Brewer, Max Minghella",1.0,True,14.0,2017.0

""New Amsterdam"" provides a rich and engaging platform for this exploration, offering a glimpse into the intricate workings of society without the real-life pressures.

The series also serves as a fascinating case study in leadership. Max, the hospital director, embodies a cool, honest, and effective leadership style that I find particularly compelling. Watching him navigate the challenges of running a large, complex hospital provides valuable insights for anyone interested in leadership, including myself as a leadership facilitator.

I’ve made it through the entire first season and there are no redeeming qualities to speak of. None of the characters face even the tiniest of consequences for any of their severely implausible actions. The solution to every problem that arises is “well I will just murder them” which, in terms of the writing is a complete cop out.

The characters are one-dimensional and unlikeable, the acting is like a soggy wet piece of white bread, the B story line of Paco and his mother being the only representation of people of color is treated irresponsibly (at best). This helpless woman at the center of everyone’s affection is a dead trope or at least it should be, and You adds nothing to the conversation. | I'm just deducting one star because vomit in every single episode seems to be a thing, common, people snack and watch TV, no need to see vomit in every episode.

This dramedy combines the worst attributes of ""Pop TV"" - beautiful people, cliché dialog, white people's problems - with deep and troubling questions about the cultural variables of murder taboo, attraction, nuclear family, literacy, and 'romance'.   The educated and skilled characters are all broken in different ways -  the authoritarian Mr. Mooney, the mother looking for Mr. Goodbar, the 'New Age' capitalists and their progeny, the multi-PTSD protagonist, and the objects of his affection. (his real love is BOOKS) 

... all juxtaposed in this narrative told by inner voices with some of the most intelligent and empathic therapists to grace the screen.  Even low latent inhibition and OCD Joe, in his sisyphian hero's journey of ""trying to be good"" has to admit and ACT on their advice, despite entering into their care for ulterior motives.  

Yes, there are thrills, chills, and mind-splatting plot twists; but there is also an engaging contrast between Hallmark dumb saccharine, original relationship dynamics, and brainy philosophical questions.  This adds up to fiction as strange and unpredictable as real life.  

I also applaud the charismatic casting, including thinking man's bombshell Saffron Borrows.  This is not high art, but it is intellectually stimulating for genre aficionados, highly relevant to our sick and fast changing culture, and quite entertaining.  I might add, addictive.","Penn Badgley, Charlotte Ritchie, Tilly Keeper, Amy-Leigh Hickman, Ed Speleers",0.0,False,0.0,2018.0

There are reviews/articles praising the young lead actress Zyra Gorecki's performance and her motivation for portraying an amputee on-screen, but 5 minutes into the pilot episode my wife said, ""she's a terrible actress"" before walking away. I was thinking exactly the same thing. Shortly thereafter, I was treated to creature special effects that would have been at home in a PlayStation2 game. Then when proceedings moved ""to the other side"", the set design, acting and pacing reminded me of cheesy 70s Sci-Fi, but with none of the nostalgia to redeem it.

A good story goes a long way. | [Spoilers]

Actually this is very bad, but somehow they manage to let you skip everytime to the next episode. The overall idea is fine. I like time-travel films/series and this one is different enough than the rest. The acting varies between decent and very bad. The cheesy typical American pro-family vibe ruins it and is even worse than Lost in Space (2018). Nice are the prehistoric (late-Pleistocene) animals, which are quite correct. Although I doubt if those spiders were really that big (large Arthropods are usually found in warmer/tropical areas).

We have had Amozon Video for a few years but never checked this show out. I can’t say we binge-watched it, because we watch tv during our meals mostly, so we never watched more than two in a sitting.

There is a lot of tension and suspense involved. They have cases that go on for a moderator amount of time, but at least one that ranged for over a season. 

In some respects, Bosch is a typical police show detective. He is driven and stubborn, and pushes the line sometimes in what he does. He has an ex-wife, of course, but he doesn’t try to run her life or threaten her new love interests. Also, Bosch has a good relationship (mostly) with his daughter, and that is a good thing.

I don't know why, but I find watching this show relaxing.

Good show to watch during the winter. | ""Virgin River"" isn't your typical high-octane drama. It's a gentle breeze in a world of hurricane-force narratives. While some might find its pace languid and its plot predictable, it's this very simplicity that makes it so captivating.

From the moment you step into the picturesque setting of Virgin River, nestled amidst breathtaking greenery and towering pines, you feel a sense of calm wash over you. It's the quintessential American small town, where everyone knows everyone and the pace of life is measured in sunshine and quiet evenings. This idyllic backdrop, coupled with the charming characters, creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere, making ""Virgin River"" the perfect escape from the frantic pace of modern life.

While the romance between Mel and Jack forms the core of the series, it's not the only thing that draws you in. The genuine community spirit, the heartwarming friendships, and the simple struggles of everyday life are beautifully depicted. The characters, with their flaws and vulnerabilities, feel like friends you've known for years.

Jack Sheridan, in particular, embodies the spirit of the series. He's the quintessential ""good guy,"" a hero who puts the needs of others before his own. It's incredibly satisfying to see him navigate life with empathy and courage, and his moments of vulnerability offer a poignant reminder that even the strongest have their struggles.

""Virgin River"" isn't a show for everyone. If you crave fast-paced action and complex plot twists, you might be disappointed. But for those seeking solace and a sense of connection, it's a breath of fresh air. It's a reminder that simple joys and genuine relationships are the true treasures in life.

So, if you're looking to escape the noise and immerse yourself in a world where kindness prevails and life moves at a slower pace, then ""Virgin River"" is waiting for you. Just be sure to pack your cozy blanket and a cup of hot cocoa, you're going to want to stay a while.","Alexandra Breckenridge, Martin Henderson, Colin Lawrence, Benjamin Hollingsworth, Lauren Hammersley",0.0,False,0.0,2019.0

I know other people will say I am not even close, but for me it really is, and that includes watching Breaking Bad and The Sopranos!

Years ago I watched ""The Corner"", which was like a prequel to The Wire, and it not only saddened me as to how people live and are dependent on drugs, but it also intrigued me. So much so that I went on to watch The Wire.

What I loved about the show is how it views the misery of drugs from different perspectives. In season 1 it focuses on the on-going battle between the street-corner dealers and the police; season 2 focuses on drug distribution; season 3 the possibility of a drug amnesty; season 4 and school kids and their choices between education, employment and drug dealers; season 5 the media take on drugs.

There is a certain feeling of helplessness running through this show, as you quickly realise that despite the extreme law enforcement the war on drugs is long gone. But because of the exceptionally good writing throughout you keep on hoping that something can be done to rid the city/state/country of this cancer.

Unlike other drama shows, this feels so real even today, and one does wonder if governments and law enforcement departments are just peeing in the wind when it comes to winning the fight on drugs. | Good but not Great 3.5/5

2 series I was told I have to watch by many were GOT n The Wire. I have to say I'm at the end of Season 4 of The Wire and its just... well, OK. I'm not sure why so many people seem to praise this show so much when nobody seemed to care when it was on, rating weren't anything to talk about not to mention it never won a single Emmy. IDK it seems like all it takes is for someone to talk up the show n everyone new jumps on the bandwagon.

And while I would recommend this show to any adult with a solid upbringing in education and common sense, it is for the total opposite end of those two traits I would recommend this show be cancelled. 

The social-liberal agenda underlying this show is without a doubt reprehensible.  The nudity, comedy, and hilarious writing cannot overshadow the concentrated subliminal indoctrination that are focal points in this series.  The formula here is the same that has been and is being used in most of animation for the last several years; that edict being, _**""Since it is 'make-believe' or 'a cartoon' it's okay to express same sex relationships, gender identity views/politics, and the manipulation of gender norms through them.  Just make with the comedy and everything else will be overlooked.""**_  (no, It won't)  
I do not know if these conditions are presented to the creator as mandatory by the company execs to get the show green-lit, or if these points are just expressions of the creator and his writing team; but the nefariousness of injecting these culturally minimal abnormal issues through a child's medium is downright socially treasonous.

Big Mouth is a marvelous show in its creation; the idea behind it is genius.  But some of the things mentioned above should not be available for just anyone to watch.  They are seriously not issues that a young mind can have perspective on and deduce comedic fun/license from viable reality.  Unfortunately people born after 1984, seem to be really, really, really...really shitty parents.  

I was not impressed with the lastest season of Big Mouth.  I especially didn't care for Maury being pregnant, Jay & Matthew's relationship, Jessi's gender assignment pronoun bullshit hang ups, Missy's black family being riddled with single-moms, gay daughters, and ""asexual"" old women, not to mention her father being a feministic ally (even though all that shit is accurate AF). I found last season's lovebug Walter being ""flamer-lite"" a bit patronizing.  And though black women do damn-near have a patent on Nasty Attitude & Bitterness, it too was a bit patronizing most of the lovebugs/Hate-worms were American afrocentric.  

Okay (whew!) Last time...If you can get past all of that, then this show is funny AF!!  Truly. There are some people, adult or teen, who can't watch this show and be entertained.  There are some who can and have a great time.  But if worse comes to worse, I would recommend--if you care about your kids under 16--that you child-lock this show.

I have been such a huge Halo fan since the first game. This is an example of a production company who liked the IDEA of the intellectual property, and had a complete disrespect and disdain for the CONTENT of the property. This felt nothing like Halo, and completely ignored the established franchise's history, lore, cannon, etc. Bad CGI, bad action sequences, and a completely underwhelming plot and actor performances.  Again, I REALLY wanted to like this. After all of the production company interviews and announcements leading up to the premiere, stating that this series was ""going to be its own thing,"" I anticipated about a 3 or 4/10 on the enjoyability meter. Solid 1.5/10 for me. Worse than even I expected. Waste of time. Why would you do this, Paramount? | I know that this show is controversial to the die hard Halo fans, but I have to say, as someone who loves that universe, I really enjoyed this show! Putting a face to Masterchief was a little nerve racking at first, but it worked out. The action in this show is really great and reminds you of the games. | At first I had no hope for any series that would be spawned by 343 industries that had to do with Halo. In my opinion 343 industries was the downfall of the Halo series. When Bungie left Microsoft and gave Halo over to 343 industries, they turned the entire series into something that was just bland and unfeeling. As much as I loved Master Chief and playing as Master Chief, the heart of Halo died the moment Bungie turned the reins over to someone else.

So what I say that I had no hope for the series when it came to TV is saying the least and most decent way I can say that I knew it was going to be a steaming pile of shit.

Surprisingly though, the TV series really wasn't that bad. They skipped over some things, rushed a few things, and redefined a couple more but overall the series was as close to what Halo is that a TV series possibly could get.



Pablo Schreiber was a good choice for Master Chief. At first I couldn't get past the fact that I knew him as pornstash from Orange is the New Black. But after about the second episode I found myself feeling like he was more Master Chief than the master chief I knew in the game. The way he talked and carried himself throughout the entire series was the exact way Master Chief does throughout the entire game series. Even down to the way he held his gun, Pablo was perfect.

I particularly grew quite fond of Spartan 125 AKA Kai. From her pretty much picking up a warthog to taking on so many elites and standing up to the status quo, Kai was a badass.



Was a little disappointed in how they changed Commander Keyes and Miranda Keyes characters so much. Other than that the actors that they got to play both parts were very good. The actress that they got to play Halsey was tremendous and I am really pleased that they brought Jen back to voice Cortana.



The first Covenant you really see in this series is the elite. Now I think that their mouthpiece is a little smaller than what it is in the games but otherwise the elites looked brilliant.


Prophets they nailed those 100%.


And if you thought the Brutes were ugly in the game, wait till you see them in the TV show. And yes I still hate Brutes that much.


Jackels and grunts don't really make that make a huge appearance until the last episode but they were still done very well.


Sadly there's only one small scene with the hunters and basically all you see is their separate forms as worms and they are scattered and taking out all the Marines on a certain ship at Meekee's request.


If you Didn't know Halo lore, you wouldn't have recognized the hunters at all you probably would have just brushed over it but I recognized it and I was like ""hey those are the hunters"".

We only see the Halo ring when MeeKee or Master Chief are touching the artifacts and it's only for a brief moments but if that's what's to come in future episodes (if there are future episodes), then I think the HALO series is in good hands. Wait, Let me correct myself there... I think the Halo TV series is in good hands cuz 343 can fuck right off.

There's only one other thing I can say that I didn't like about the HALO series and that was the fact that Master Chief kind of went off character and lost his virginity as Cortana watched. That was something none of us needed to see. But not a lot of skin was shown in that scene so we'll give it a pass just because it wasn't an extra long sex scene that we didn't need.

Overall if you're a Halo fan, the TV series isn't that bad so give it a chance. We're not that far into the lore or the games so to speak that you couldn't see what you want to see from it .... there's so much more that's coming if they continue this series. We have Johnson to look forward to (hopefully), scarabs, the actual halo rings, the flood, and the forerunners. If they choose to continue the Halo TV series it could be huge. Let's just hope they decide to keep going...

Hope they finish the fight. | I had hoped after season one we had seen the last of ""Halo"" the series. 

In short and without wasting too much time, in this reviewers opinion,  cringe worthy, woke nonsense, with a thin veneer of a sci fi series that looks and behaves nothing like the famous games franchise, it apes.

Only upside I can see is reasonable CGI.....

My advice, if you haven't already, watch the movies instead. Oh and play the games, they are great fun, with a story much better than this. | It could have been an a average sci-fi show but with the attachment of the halo name it just plunges this show to the bottom.

It's got everything- great characters, strong storylines, many issues, and horror, romance, tragedy, comedy, coming of age, and much more!! | Wow. I mean it unfortunately came out in 97 and ended in '03 which was really the worst possible time for me. That was going to HS and working full time to save for college and then going to college and working two jobs to avoid debt time.

So when it came out I was vaguely aware of it and some people who's opinions on things like this I still trust absolutely loved it... and some actually hated it. Which to me made it a controversial must see for me... but 97-03 was just not the time.

I didn't get to watch it until life calmed down a bit and that was around '09. And, of course, by then NO ONE wanted to talk about i and everyone had moved on to other shows. So I was left in my own Buffy Bubble and it became a sort of private love affair.

So... what you have here is a television series based on B-Movie tropes that then turns them upside down in a way that you will absolutely love... if you love B-Movies and all their tropes.

The cast is across the board hysterical. It's not really a comedy, but you're going to at least chuckle in every episode.

And the pretty blond ditz that dies in every B horror movie is the kick-butt savior. Which is problematic in 2020 because you aren't supposed to acknowledge that women were ever portrayed as heroic before 2016, and, as a result, any mention of this will get you the N , M, and F word labels by people want to say that they are fighting for equality and thus Buffy doesn't fit in their timelines....

... so even today it's controversial... but this time it is controversial by the people that SHOULD like it... because it was made before 2016 so they don't.

Point being, it is awesome from start to finish... I'm one of the freaks that didn't take any issue with Dawn...and if you have one of the better teachers you are going to learn all about how it forever changed the English language... so there you go, if the title is the reason you don't like it, you got that academia link.

wednesday,"Wednesday Addams is sent to Nevermore Academy, a bizarre boarding school where she attempts to master her psychic powers, stop a monstrous killing spree of the town citizens, and solve the supernatural mystery that affected her family 25 years ago — all while navigating her new relationships.","Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Mystery, Comedy",8.439,5.178181565308056,9.08839870117094,True,Returning Series,0.6931471805599453,2.0794415416798357,3.912023005428146,"Netflix basic with Ads, Netflix","Wednesday Mary Sue Addams, I counted at least 10 things she's perfect at. If not for the woke ideology being pushed, this could be a very good tv series. Steer clear. | Wednesday's plot focuses on it's surface between the balance of power between normal everyday people (Like you and I), and (I don't know a better way to put it) cryptid kids; Wednesday (played by Jenna Ortega) is part of the latter (obviously).  As the plot thickens, we find out that power struggle between the groups has been ingrained in everyone for generations. You may even say it's been institutionalized since the community's inception. 

People can read into this however they want; what really matters is if it works or not.  Given that the kids are literally werewolves, sirens, medusas and other cryptid creatures of lore, it is my opinion if you feel this dynamic is only in place to make you feel fragile, than you need  to (in the words of my grandfather) 'get a tougher skin'.  Honestly, it's a TV show, are you that wounded?

As these kids are in fact literally and physically outcasts to our society, their struggles being so and trying to fit in work in this story.  I believe because Wednesday isn't physically a cryptid people expected something else.  She's always been, along with her whole family obviously not normal and thus outcasts like the rest. 

What I really enjoyed about this is the dynamic between Jenna and the un-talking member of the Adams' family, Thing (physically played by **Victor Dorobantu**).  The actor wears a green suite except for his hand and contorts his way through every scene. The result is a way more realistic human hand running around than any CGI could have ever done. I also love the duplicity between Wednesday and her trying-to-be / would-be warewolf roommate, Endid (joyfully played by **Emma Myers**).  There are honestly quite a few very likeable supporting characters that make the gloom and doom (that I love) from the main character and balance it into something even more plateable. 

If your nostalgic for the kooky family, the show has plenty of fan service that isn't too blatant (at least not for everything all the time). You get the finger snaps, you get Christina Ricci (for those 90's kids fans), and you get a pretty accurate Adams Family as compared to the original source material. 

I believe the plots mystery will keep people engaged enough (it's no Knives Out or Glass Onion), but combine that with the strength of the characters and you get a really great TV show worth re-watching;  which is personally one of the highest praise I can put on a TV series.  Highly recommended! | One of those hard to endure type fantasy shows. Unnecessary and often predictably silly dialogues, bizarre character relations and motivations, shallow plot. On the bright side the show does get bearable with time plus some great cello music selection. | The show takes viewers on a journey into the mind of Wednesday Addams, exploring her eerie and supernatural world as she grows into her own. The writing is sharp and witty, with a cast of endearing and frightening characters that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The special effects and production design are top-notch, fully immersing viewers into Wednesday's spooky and fantastical world. Overall, I highly recommend Wednesday for fans of the macabre and those looking for a fresh and exciting take on the Addams Family franchise. Don't miss out on this standout series stunning Gleaming Aura!"" | Watchable with some good messages and some good lines although the grumpy teenager became a bit tiresome.

The plot is beautifully orchestrated to emphasize moments and make them hit harder. 

Season 6 and 7 whilst feeling disjointed from the rest of both the agents of shield style and the grander marvel universe, is a masterpiece of storytelling.

The only problem with Marvel's Agents of Shield is the reliance on the MCU, maybe that is why it became popular. But that is the main capping of the shows imagination and possibility. | A series to have a place for in your heart (27 September 2020)

It's not many series that age well. This did. My ratings for this series started around 6 or 7 and pushed their way through to almost perfect score. Is it objectively comparable to other 9's or 10's? I am not sure. Is it, subjectively? Hell yeah.

I finished the series thinking that I will miss them all. You love the characters and you stay engaged no matter what. They all grow, they all feel and they all live the part. In this final season more than the rest, it is crystal clear that they love the show as well. They have their fun with it and that's something really precious for any viewer.

The show touches upon almost if not all the ""big"" hot sci-fi and science subjects. And it does so gracefully. Does it not have cheesy or ""no-sense"" parts? Well yeah it has, how could it not? But who cares? You learn to love even these small drivels as in the grant scheme of the show, they are even funny.

The simple truth is that they rocked it on. Both the actors from the first pilot, to anyone else than joined in the later seasons. This is not a masterpiece series and it doesn't need to be. This is not a filming/acting/etc. crew. It's a family. And I am happy to have spent time with them all. To their ups and their downs.

Yes, this is a review of a fan so it maybe doesn't ring as objective. But this show got from winning my respect to winning my love, keeping my excitement topped along 7 bloody years, making it difficult for me to write an objective piece. I couldn't have wished for anything different.

Despite its rather liberal happy-clappy perspective with most of its secondary storylines, TWW is exceptionally well-written and very rarely fails to deliver some rather thought-provoking episodes. 

I have had many boxset marathons with this show over the years, and I must admit my adulation for certain seasons has changed somewhat in that time. Back then I adored the first 4 seasons, while dismissing season 5 outright, and only having a grudging respect for seasons 6 & 7. But these days I much prefer 6&7 over 1, 3 and 4. No idea why but there you go!

As for the acting, well other than Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe and John Spencer the first few seasons were a cast of relative unknowns, but come the middle of S1 it doesn't matter because the likes of Alison Janey's CJ, Bradley Whitford's wonderful Josh Lyman and Richard Schiff's brooding Toby Ziegler play their roles exceptionally well.

Of course the greatest aspect of this show is the writing, especially for the first four seasons when Aaron Sorkin was directly involved. And even after he left under a cloud the writing for season 5 and beyond was still very good, if a little uneven.

It has been awhile since I last picked up on this show. So come the winter months I might just snuggle down and enjoy the walk & talk with these guys once again. | If every program on TV was this good I'd never leave the house.

I have to agree with the reviewers who call this the best drama show ever, at least for entertainment value. Of course, it gets panned often for political reasons by people who perhaps don't watch it enough to see that, yes, it is a liberal administration being represented here, but they often make mistakes and fail in their efforts, so it is hardly a progressive utopia. 

I write novels in my spare tome, and I like to think my dialogue is a strong point, so I have nothing but admiration for the fast and witty conversations in this show. You may literally have to watch the series a second time to catch everything thrown at you in their quick back and forth banter, often delivered as they pace around the West Wing set. But that is no hardship either. Much has been made about Aaron Sorkin's departure from the show, and perhaps there was a slight drop in quality because of it, but it was still well worth watching. It was so good, the new kids couldn't break it. | The first edition, indeed season, of this political drama is as good as it gets. Aaron Sorkin has created a monster - in just about every sense - and the cast led by Martin Sheen (""President Bartlet"") consistently deliver well as the senior advisors in his administration - alongside some sadly infrequent appearances from his no-nonsense wife (Stockard Channing) - guide us through the daily trials and tribulations accompanying American government. For the most part, the pace is hectic, controlled (sometimes) by the calming, sagacious influence of his Chief of Staff ""Leo"" (John Spencer) and deals with just about every sort of scenario - domestic, foreign, familial and collegiate that comes across the paths of the Director of Communications (Richard Schiff), his deputy (Rob Lowe), the Press Secretary (Allison Janney) as well as ""Josh Lyman"" (Bradley Whitford) - the passionate but occasional liability that is the deputy Chief of Staff. Sorkin and the cast manage, effortlessly, to create a series of scenarios that reminded me of both ""Yes, Minister"" and the original (British) ""House of Cards"" - comedy and humour expertly mixed with politicking on a grand, yet personal, scale. Nothing is off limits insofar as the subjects covered and it presents as authentic a depiction of government as we are ever likely to see. Personally, I though Stockard Channing added loads to this as the First Lady and Janney and Spencer's characters gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, someone in there knew what the hell was going on. Of course it takes an hugely American perspective on things, which as a non-American grated a bit on occasion with an intermingling of fact and fiction that sometimes compromised the integrity of the stories; but in the main it is one hell of a watch. Unfortunately, around about the start of series four, the writing starts to slide and the cast - fresh and vibrant at the beginning of the run - begin to take too great a role behind the camera; the plots become too personal (even romantic) and far-fetched. The original stars feature a bit less and it loses much of it's potency and it's plausibility. Certainly, the last two series which focus on presidential succession and sidelined many of the cast we had followed since day one left me cold and disinterested. By the conclusion I felt there had been maybe two series too many... At it's best, it is great, thought-provoking, entertainment though and well worth binging on. | Pepa the Pig for Adult Liberals. Or maybe, ""Mickey Mouse Takes Office."" I can't decide.

Perhaps I'm hyper sensitive, having been what equates to an American liberal for most of my life (I'm Danish, and here being liberal puts you on the right, but I've been a lefty for more than forty years), but trying to watch this show instantly fatigues me. Not because of the acting, which is above average, the dialog, which is well-written if overly verbose, not even the stories, which seem implausible but entertaining, and this IS fiction, so you need to allow for unrealistic and entertaining things happening 24/7. Otherwise it'd get boring.

No, what drains my energy is the way it treats me as a mental toddler. It's the way the resentment for people with opposing views (conservatives, religious people, etc.) is matched only by the self-righteousness and the conviction of having the moral high ground and superior intelligence. The ease with which people are divided into moral and immoral boxes based on their religious views, political affiliation, or even demography. And isn't it nice, because we all agree that religious zealots are terrible, right? That conservatives are immoral, right? That Texans are stupid, right? Lucky we have our club, where we're educated, virtuous and bearers of The Right Morals™. 

Episode one present a religiously based conflict that is so overly constructed that it borders on pathetic (hence my Pepa the Pig reference). The conflict is resolved not through discussion or discourse, but by president Mickey Mouse turning up and revealing how the religious group is in cahoots with people sending his twelve-year-old daughter a death threat in the form of basically a voodoo doll. How convenient. Such lazy writing. I wonder how a diplomatic person with some deep rhetorical skills might have solved that conflict in lieu of one side basically declaring moral bankruptcy. I don't know, maybe some kind of political figure, like a head of state or something. Guess that's for another show. This show has trumpets blaring instead, while the camera pans across our great imaginary president Highground. 

Just for the record, even though my father was a priest and I was raised Christian, today I think religion is garbage and I've been an atheist for about 25 years. But that's my opinion and it says nothing about my moral values, and what anyone else believes doesn't either. I just don't appreciate this lazy and presumptuous ""religious conservative therefore bad, amirite?"" fallacy. 

I quit at the beginning of episode two, when President Mouse basically says they didn't lose Texas in the primaries because of a joke about cowboy hats, but because Texans are stupid, or ""when the president learned Latin,"" as it puts it. One has to wonder if the writers just don't care about alienating an entire state of potential viewers, or if they think Texans are so stupid they didn't catch that insult. Either way, the club that you're supposed to be in to be able to watch something like this and think it's okay to disrespect your opponent's intelligence and points of view in this manner is not one I want to be a member of. Not anymore. 

I'm done with this restrictive and divisive club of supposedly morally superior intelligencia, with the undercurrent of resentment and obnoxious entitlement. I'm sick and tired of having echo chamber ""discussions"" where you constantly fear stepping out of line lest you be called a bigot, or a racist, or a misogynist, or a Nazi, or whatever is the most efficient card you can use to shut down even the slightest sign of dissent from the implicit party line. 

And yes, as I said, I'm probably hyper sensitive because this to me is such a large problem right now, but that's why I can't watch this. I'm surprised a show from 1999 is this blatantly and unapologetically biased, but maybe that's because I've been liberal myself all that time and it just seemed okay. I mean, the religious and conservatives ARE wrong, and mostly idiots, right? To my religious and conservative friends who watch this and get rightfully offended, from a former liberal who thought this was okay, even truth, and behalf of my other liberal friends who still think like this but aren't bad people, I apologize. 

And think of it like this: With shows like these being made, and much worse media content being released currently,  some people, like me, get increasingly turned off by the divisiveness and implicit brainwashing, to the point where they simply stop being liberals. I don't know what I'm gonna vote next time, but it won't be left. If I were American, I wouldn't vote Democrat. But then, there'd have to be a candidate other than Trump, because I don't think that guy has America's interests at heart, only his own.","Martin Sheen, Allison Janney, John Spencer, Bradley Whitford, Joshua Malina",1.0,True,26.0,1999.0

Lets start with the obvious. Yes, its new Disney so I'm not surprised to find its a little woke. Thankfully, its only a ""little woke"" and whilst I find that really, really irritating at times and I wish they'd knock it off, its delivered in small doses. 

On the positive side this series actually tells a not unfamiliar but entirely engaging story. It feels like a mix of the 1985 film ""The Goonies"" and a pirate adventure, Robert Louis Stevenson (""Treasure Island"") style, in space. More specifically, the Star Wars universe. 

Its focus is a group of kids, human and alien who find themselves castaways on a pirate space ship, having an adventure far away from the planet, they call home.To make matters more complicated, space pirates want to capture them to find the location of their home-world, as its considered a mythological treasure planet. Oh and there's an alleged Jedi, just to round things out. 

This series works because its inherently familiar, dipping into tropes of adventure, family and friendship. Plus its special effects are unsurprisingly excellent. The cast too, have great chemistry, so there's a win on that front, as well.

In summary, I never thought I'd ever again find myself promoting a Star Wars franchise production but ""Skeleton Crew"" is actually really good. Sure it might be because, in my estimation so much that's gone before hasn't been especially inspiring, shall we say but irrespective, looking at this series in isolation from everything else, its thus far, still decent.

*Based on the full first season handed to press*

""The Last of Us is the first live-action videogame adaptation able to finally break the frustrating curse, reaching the so-desired unprecedented level of excellence.

Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann construct a complex character study driven by fascinating protagonists, Joel and Ellie, exploring the grief, traumas, and tragedies of their lives through unimaginable moral dilemmas, emotionally heavy conversations, and devastating moments.

Save for rare exceptions, the episodic narrative formula is remarkably efficient, offering a panoply of intriguing characters and outstanding performances - Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey clearly stand out from the rest. A more intimate, grounded version of a post-apocalyptic world that doesn't lack gory, violent action/horror sequences. Gustavo Santaolalla's score couldn't be a better fit.

Rating: A- | No spoilers here.

I went into this show cautiously optimistic, after seeing the trailers. I, like so many others, have been burned by horrid video game adaptations ***cough*** ""_Halo_"" ***cough***. I was incredibly surprised by the first episode. LOVED IT! While yes, the pacing was a bit slower than the game's first few moments, I felt like it was appropriate to set the stage for everything to come later. TLOU is one of my favorite games on the planet, and I am really hard to please when it comes to media. I am the definition of nit-picky when it comes to writing, production, and character development, especially with pre-existing and beloved material. I can say honestly, and without reservation that if the creators put as much attention to detail and fan-oriented storytelling into the later episodes of this season, this could easily be one of the best adaptations of a game, out there. I really can't wait to see what they do with it. | Why do series feel the need to be woke? I had invested quite a lot of faith in this series until episode 3, which I call 'Gays of our lives"". 

An entire episode about the lives of two beardy, gay blokes, that has next to nothing to do with the overriding story and feels like virtue signalling. 

I don't mind gay people. I've known a few over the years but what's the need for this? I wasted 20 or so minutes, till I realised this was going to take up the majority of the episode, at which point, I stopped watching. 

In  short, I don't need to be lectured, reformed or informed about alternative life styles. If I did, I'd attend a meeting, join a forum, whatever. And that's the underlying point really. I come to entertainment to be entertained, not lectured. 

I'm out.

I can't say that the show is bad in general. But it is far from living up to its potential. And episode 3 has show us that it can really suck (no pun intended) at times.

I am going to loosely address some reasons for why I think this show is disappointing and not as good as it could be:

- Bad casting of main characters, unnecessary type-switching.

Though I think that most of the actors are good, a lot of them and especially the main characters are not matching their counterparts from the game and the game (at least TLOU, Part I) just nailed it. The actors are good, but the casting choices still are just bad. Especially Ellie is just miscast all the way.

- Bad chemistry between the characters.

There is no matching chemistry between the actors of Joel & Tess or Joel & Ellie.

- Pointless deviations from the original story (see episode 3).

Those deviations don't add anything good to the story, they are just annoying distraction at best and derailment at worst.

- Sometimes just stupid, boring or pointless.

There is more examples than just the bigger part of episode 3 for that.

- Mediocre storytelling.

When it sticks to the main plot, it's not bad. But it's not really good either.

After episode 3 I decided to take a break from watching the show and before I would continue to watch, I will wait till the whole season has aired and the reviews came in. If according to the non-shill and non-cheerleader reviews the show will give us more crap in the direction of episode 3, I'm out for good. | Great adaptation of the legendary game! | I was sceptical at first whether as a fan of the games the series could win 
me over. It certainly took some time getting used to the new Ellie.

However, the series is a faithful reinterpretation of the game. Many things are different, but (as of episode 6) it has just the right balance of keeping the core of the story while changing, adding and adapting details to the new medium. | ""The Last of Us"" is a post-apocalyptic TV series based on the popular video game of the same name. The story follows the journey of Joel, a smuggler, and Ellie, a teenage girl who may be the key to finding a cure for a deadly fungal infection that has ravaged the world.

The series features outstanding performances from Pedro Pascal as Joel, Bella Ramsey as Ellie, and Anna Torv as Tess. The chemistry between the main characters is excellent, and the casting is spot-on.

The show's writing is superb, and it captures the essence of the video game while adding a fresh perspective. The narrative is engaging, and the pacing is just right, with each episode leaving you on the edge of your seat, eager to see what happens next.

The show's production value is top-notch, with stunning visuals and cinematography that capture the bleak and haunting atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world. The use of practical effects and makeup is impressive and adds to the overall immersion of the story.

Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is an outstanding TV series that does justice to the source material. It's a must-watch for fans of the video game and anyone who enjoys gripping and emotional storytelling. I would rate it a 9 out of 10.

 

Written and Reviewed by RSOliveira | The last of us is by far the best adaptation of a video game. From the gorgeous cinematography, to the breathtaking production design, or the terrific performances. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are perfect as Joel and Ellie. Their chemistry and emotional death are truly a outstanding. The guest staring roles are absolutely fantastic. Anna Torv, Gabriel Luna, Nick Offerman, Murray Bartlett, Lamar Johnson, Keivonn Montreal Woodard and Melanie Lynskey. Also having some of the original actors from the game in the series is also great. I can’t say enough about how the production design team transform Canada into a post apocalyptic hell hole. They should get all of the awards just for that. And I almost forgot the clickers their design is absolutely just on point. I could go on and on about this show. However I’m just going to that any new series that comes out after this is going to have a tough time. Because The Last of Us is by far the best series of 2023. | As someone who's never even heard of the video game (a factor which seems to polarise reviews) I can say that I enjoyed this series more than I thought I would although some of the episodes were in danger of becoming formulaic. Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey) need to travel across an America devastated by a fungus which turns people into infectious 'zombies' or rogue raiders. The two main characters are brilliantly played and I think this probably secures Bella Ramsey's career. The rendering of the devastated landscapes and cities was amazing and very plausible. The plot was thin but enough to keep one's interest and, I'd guess, thicker than the computer game and most other zombie apocolypse films. I think it is probably an advantage to not know the video game and a disadvantage to having watched 'The Worst Witch' which took me a couple of episodes to shake off. | Not normally huge on zombie shows / movies but this one is quite good. I'm all about Pedro Pascal and the fungus angle is a cool one, especially as someone that is fascinated by mycelial networks. | Well the story from the video game was great, and they stayed true to that which ultimately led to a great tv show. Very enjoyable. HBO has a great track record of pumping out high quality shows and this one is no different. 8/10. Hopefully the second season lives up to expectations, but if the video game is anything to judge by then it likely won't be nearly as good as season 1. | Show is very good. It's interesting and after watching it I decided to play the game and I can say that it's quite close to the game. Cast is also good and bad at the same time. For example Pedro Pascal is doing amazing job playing Joel and is actually very similar to game character. I think they did good job matching this actor to the character. Gerrard Buttler would be another great choice as well. Actress who's playing Ellie's character is nailing it as well, although in game she has blue eyes and actress has brown eyes. But I think it's not that bad. But like I said, there are bad matches too because of propaganda put in this show as well sadly. For example, Joe's daughter in original source (game) is white, however geniuses in show decided that black daughter should be better for him. Also, Tommy's new wife is white in game, but in show they made her black on purpose which is very obvious. Also there's whole episode dedicated to LGBT propaganda (episode 3). Sady this crap is ruining amazing show, but it is what it is... That's why I'm  giving this show 7/10. If not the cancer woke agenda, I would give it 10/10. I mean, if we close an eye on propaganda, show itself is very good and interesting and very close to original game. It's hundred times better that Witcher adapatation of game which is horribly ruined completely by the propaganda. In short, this show isn't perfect, but it's still good and there are far worse propaganda plagued shows nowadays.","Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey",0.0,False,0.0,2023.0

As of 2018 The edginess is gone. There are no risks in the jokes. They all consist of two things, 1. Trump is bad. and 2. This was a thing, remember it?

Neither of those really work for me. Make fun of Trump all you want, but do it with a punch line. Most of the time they forget the punchline. Simply not liking him is NOT a punchline. You have to exaggerate something, make it satire, mock it in some way. I don't even care if it's a cruel mockery...so long as it doesn't seem like they are just stating an opinion.

Opinions are NOT jokes.

The same thing goes with their ""remember this, this was a thing"" jokes...

They leave you sitting there waiting for them to say something funny about it. You're with them for a little while, ""Yeah I remember it, go on..."" then you realize that, no, that was the joke.

That's not a joke, that's just asking me to remember something.

Again, if they had a punch line, if they said something about what they were asking me to remember, then it might be funny...but they don't. The jokes are literally ""this was a thing, laugh at it."" and that's not funny. It has to be followed up with something.

Like with Trump, an opinion is NOT a joke unless it is followed by something. The same thing with a memory, a memory is NOT a joke in and of itself. They both have to be followed by something | Saturday Night Live will always be my comfort show. The longevity and influence SNL has had on the comedy scene is unmatched. It has been the catalyst for so many careers, e.g. Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray, Will Ferrell  etc... The show has definitely had its ups and downs but, in taking a step back it is evident that the show has remained consistently mixed in it entire run. 

Not every season has had great writers or talent, some actors have been much more successful than others, and yet it has always found an audience. My favourite era of the show was the mid 2000s with Bill Hader and Andy Samberg, but most people have a a preference for whatever season they had as a teenager. The consistency of structure and crew unites all the different casts, creating a familiar image and sensibility, found in every season.

There will always be a host monologue, musical guest, Weekend Update and most importantly, it will always be LIVE! The production process of a pitch meeting with the host, staying up all night on Tuesdays to write, read-through and dress rehearsal. Whether it's 1975 or 2023, everyone endures the same experience (although whether they have the aid of cocaine is certainly a difference!). 

The argument SNL hasnt been funny since the ""insert previous ten years"" is redundant. Every season of the show has been criticised for not being funny but every season of the show has produced hilarious sketches and shone a light on the new faces of comedy. In the 70s they had Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, the 80s they had Julia Louis Dreyfus and Conan O'Brien, the 90s they had Will Ferrell and Eddy Murphy, the 2000s Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the 2010s Kate McKinnon and Vanessa Bayer and finally in the 2020s we have Bowen Yang and Marcello Hernandez.

I am writing this review after just finishing watching the first and probably only season of ""The Penguin"" today. For me, it's an 8/10 (which, on my scale, is a very good rating, though on IMDb that’s more like a 9/10). It’s an HBO series. While it’s not perfect (but what is, really?), I think the series is very, very well done. I don’t expect there to be a second season, nor is there a need for one; it works perfectly as a standalone miniseries.

The series builds on the movie The Batman (with Robert Pattinson in the lead role) and follows the Penguin’s rise to power, bridging the story between that movie and the planned sequel.

I can only recommend it — but I ask you, if it doesn’t grab you right away, please at least watch through the third episode and then decide.

You don’t necessarily need to have seen The Batman either, since the Penguin appears only as a side character there, merely a capo in Gotham’s mafia. The series does reference a few events from the movie (such as some neighborhoods flooding after a terrorist attack), but, as I said, you don’t need to know the specifics to follow the plot. Still, it wouldn’t hurt to have seen the movie, especially since it’s quite good.

It’s also worth mentioning that we're dealing with an anti-hero here who is, essentially, a villain. I won’t go into more detail on that — it’s part of the experience to discover this character’s nature, and perhaps to be as deceived by him as the other characters in the series are by the Penguin’s manipulations.","Colin Farrell, Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Deirdre O'Connell, Clancy Brown",0.0,False,0.0,2024.0

Every episode is ""edge of your seat"" entertainment. Production, direction and actor craft reaches above and beyond all prior franchise endeavors. This is NO LIMITS Star Trek. | It's hard/impossible to find an online review of the full season.  The full 15-episode Season 1 is available on Netflix here in Europe. Access in the USA is via other paid services, at least on initial release, but American viewers might be able to catch up with this on Netflix if they travel.  Meanwhile all initial reviews are based on the pilot (episodes 1 and 2 combined).  The pilot attracted good reviews - more than the full season deserves - in part simply from the pleasure of seeing a new Star Trek series on screen. 

By the end of Season 1, it feels uneven.  There are some great ideas lurking in this, but it also has some serious issues: bad pacing, terrible acting in parts, and some obvious signs of a limited budget.

Highlights:

* Jason Isaacs as Captain Lorca is one of the best Star Trek captains: tough, bold, decisive, commanding, but also human and flawed.
* Sonequa Martin-Green is a fine protagonist and very watchable - it's interesting that the captain is not the main character. She successfully portrays an upright, capable but insubordinate character through the season's full story arc, and it's all plausible. A shame that her Vulcan upbringing doesn't come into the story so much in the season's later episodes.
* The romantic relationship given most screen time is between two men (a timely 21st century update in Star Trek's long tradition of diversity).  It is well handled: we see that these men have a strong and loving relationship and there is a deep emotional hit later when one of them is harmed.
* The subtitle options include ""Klingon"".

Lowlights:

* The Klingon race has been ""rebooted"" as a race of cumbersome, slow, religious nuts.  The prosthetics look nothing like earlier incarnations of the Klingons.  The idea of these beings as the galaxy's fiercest warriors is preposterous.  A serious design mis-step here.
* The timeline here predates the Original Series by around 10 years, but the Discovery appears to have more modern (and far more reliable) technology than the Enterprise ever did, even though this is supposed to be an older vessel.  The uniforms also look more up-to-date.  These things are going to irritate the fans.
* In an entire 15 episode season the crew visit a grand total of ... three planets.  I guess this minimises production expenditure on location shoots, but it severely limits the sense of adventure and discovery.  Even a low-budget sci-fi show like Killjoys (excellent if you haven't seen it yet) has more planets than this.
* Michelle Yeoh - I don't know if she is unwell or what, but this formerly great actor ruins most of the scenes she is in.  She can't even say simple lines correctly (her intonation is wrong and the wrong words are stressed).  If this is an intended effect then it's extremely badly portrayed.  Her character here is supposed to have a Malaysian accent (we know this because at one point she explains that she was born in Langkawi - that's an island in Malaysia) but Malaysian people don't maul English like this.  Overall just a shame: presumably a good chunk of the acting budget was spent on this headline name, and she's easily the worst actor in the show.

A series like Star Trek wouldn't be complete without its special effects.  Here again there is a mixed bag: some beautiful work with the 'mycelia' and the general space scenes are pretty, though it all seems a bit static.  The bridge and ship interiors are too sparse - Engineering lacks any sense of powerful forces being held in check by advanced machinery.  A trick shot where the camera moves from outside the ship, through the window/view screen, to the interior of the Bridge is used over and over again - nice the first couple of times.

Overall grade B.  It feels like a missed opportunity to bring this much-loved franchise up to date.  Non-fans are likely to give up on this before the end of the season, and I can't really blame them.  Fans are going to be, at least, annoyed.

There have been other recent geek favourites which have disappointed, even though they have had big budgets and big names involved. Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice is the clearest example.  I believe the root cause of these problems is that studios put key people in charge, as producers or directors or screen writers or casting directors, who are just not that into the source material.  Some people think that sci-fi fans will swallow any old rubbish.  That is patronising and it is a mistake, especially in this era of vast viewing choice.  Fans hate to be patronised.  The fans are looking for movies and TV shows made with integrity, respect and love.  Anything made with that level of care will have no problem attracting new, younger fans.  The positive audience reaction to Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fine example.

Star Trek: Discovery was - you would hope - aiming for that target.  It does have some of the elements right (Captain Lorca puts on a splendid Scottish accent at one point).  But overall it does not make the grade. | Basically, the whole thing is a politically correct propaganda show. Everyone is an independent and capable woman. The only white male in a position of power is a single capitan, his with his flaws too. The rest? Incredibly obvious.

Episode 10 is about a parallel universe in which - although the human race rules over everything, it's painted as an evil 'Terran Empire' and villified to the max. Everyone is evil. Why? Because the core mantra of this alternate human race is - listen to this - preserving their own kind (basically, they made an episode about just how bad a racist universe might be).

Ridiculous. Watch The Orville instead, it's 100 times better and has none of this political crap in it.

Our movies and show should be politics free. | The first season of Star Trek Discovery I can only describe as awful. Like the vacuum of space it was sucked dry of the warmth and sense of hope and optimism found in the wonderful 1990's series. 

It came as a relief that the writers and producers listened to fans and crafted a much improved second season. That said, the hangover from season one remains and its uncomfortably starchy militaristic vibe, has not completely dissipated. 

To add to the series woes there is, of course, competition from  the truly wonderful series ""The Orville"" which many long time fans, including myself, feel is the true successor to the older Star Trek series. Its upbeat vibe, well timed humour and its sense of optimism and thoughtful approach make it addictive viewing. 

In short not a dismal addition to the Trekkie universe but one that has a long way to go to redeem itself too. 5/10 from me. | A brilliant example of current entertainment television! DSC is not only the best Star Trek to date, it represents the best of modern science fiction, period! Cinematic in scope, DSC is more imaginative, thoughtful, exciting, interesting and  absolutely beautiful to watch than any other previous manifestation of Star Trek. For the first time we see a wide range of carefully developed, nuanced characters facing a variety of situations yet upholding the same Star Trek values of Gene Roddenberry. Have some of the 'usual' stereotypical characterizations taken back seat to a more diverse presentation of humanity? Absolutely! I think that is a plus NOT a minus. | This is Star Trek as people who thought Star Trek was stupid and didn't watch it imagined it to be. Cheap soap opera melodrama, unnecessary references to physicists, poor storytelling masquerading as lousy fake zeep zoop ork bork science. Awful. But put a shine on a turd and people will think it's low calorie old family recipe cicolatta gellato. | The problems this show deals with are pretty basic and surface level. The characters aren't complex but as usual driven by basic, human emotions despite supposedly being from other races and species.

It feels like the show tries to make every episode themed: time-travel, parallel dimension, alternate universe, hostile take-over, bla bla bla. One thing's for sure though, they didn't skimp on the visuals, because they are phenomenal!

The show does however drop you into a world that has little to no frame of reference. As somebody who knew very little about Star Trek, despite not having too many new terms thrown at you, it's not easy to keep track of which species/race they're talking about, why they're important, what technical device is being referenced, what it's supposed to do,....

On the subject of physics, they keep making the same mistake: sound in space.

All in all, it's a good series to turn your brain off to and just ignore the random terms thrown at you, don't ask too many questions about the plot, lean back, and let your brain be drizzled with Sci-Fi lite. | For starters it's dark...and that's really NOT Star Trek. Star Trek is optimistic and light even when it goes a little gritty. It's supposed to be an optimistic future where Earth strives for a Utopia...and Discovery isn't that at all.

Discovery is bleak and pessimistic and really, that's not what I want when I want to sit down and watch Star Trek.

And then it's weighted in the present, and again, that's not what I want in science fiction.

A reflection of the present is fine...a satire on it is fine...but to try and anchor the plots so much in the present that it becomes BLATANT...that's not science fiction anymore.

And then what did they do to the orcs...I'm sorry, Klingons? In a prequel series? I know they have always micro-evolved in appearance but this is insanely different.

They are so different that it's almost insulting to even the casual fan let alone their loyal base.

And then, yeah, like so many other shows it does that thing where it's almost racist towards the ONE demographic that it is currently politically correct to be racist against...and that's not Star Trek either, if anything, it's the opposite because that was intended to be solved a long, long time ago in the franchise's history.

The Klingons are the bad guys for NOT wanting the Federation to cleanse them of their culture and heritage...they are written as the bad guys for NOT wanting to be ethnically cleansed!!!!!!

I know it's a play on White Supremacy, but seriously, this does NOT make the Federation look like the good guys here. Now, if the Klingons wanted to Ethnically cleanse OTHER groups, that would make them look like the bad guys. NOT the other way around.

It was running on a treating service we had, so we started watching it. We liked it enough so that when our service suddenly stopped running The Good Wife we signed up for CBS All Access.

We have seen all seven seasons now and while I still liked it, the plots started to lag for me a bit in later seasons. Their professional relationships between different law firms or them personally kept changing, reminding me of the show Friends, where it felt like the main characters took turns dating each other.

Another element of the plots that struck me was the formula they seem sped to follow. They used a long running plot, usually political, that ran for entire seasons sometimes, and also had cases they handled that wrapped up in one show. Those cases often ran the same course: first one side would do well in court, then the other side would introduce something that helps them, and then the first side would — you get the idea. I called them reversals and got so I expected them every ten minutes or so for each show. Plus their investigators seemed really good at digging up dirt Fast. It isn’t a terrible thing. They only have 40+ minutes for each show and they want to cram drama in where they can. Perhaps I just noticed it more because I write novels and do a lot of plotting myself.

But we watched the entire seven seasons. I won’t be tempted to watch them again, but I don’t regret the time spent on them either. So now, before we give up CBS All Access, we need to try the sequel series, The Good Fig, and a show Alan Cumming is in that sounds good: Instinct.","Julianna Margulies, Christine Baranski, Matt Czuchry, Alan Cumming, Cush Jumbo",1.0,True,5.0,2009.0

matinee theater,"Matinee Theater is an American anthology series that aired on NBC during the Golden Age of Television, from 1955 to 1958. The series, which ran daily in the afternoon, was frequently live. It was produced by Albert McCleery, Darrell Ross, George Cahan and Frank Price with executive producer George Lowther. McCleery had previously produced the live series Cameo Theatre which introduced to television the concept of theater-in-the-round, TV plays staged with minimal sets.

Jim Buckley of the Pewter Plough Playhouse recalled:

When Al McCleery got back to the States, he originated a most ambitious theatrical TV series for NBC called Matinee Theater: to televise five different stage plays per week live, airing around noon in order to promote color TV to the American housewife as she labored over her ironing. Al was the producer. He hired five directors and five art directors. Richard Bennett, one of our first early presidents of the Pewter Plough Corporation, was one of the directors and I was one of the art directors and, as soon as we were through televising one play, we had lunch and then met to plan next week’s show. That was over 50 years ago, and I’m trying to think; I believe the TV art director is his own set decorator —yes, of course! It had to be, since one of McCleery’s chief claims to favor with the producers was his elimination of the setting per se and simply decorating the scene with a minimum of props.

It can be difficult to maintain tension and drama describing true events that the viewer might be already aware of to some extent, but this program manages it nicely. It is a little predictable in how it tells the story, by which I mean it uses several angles from different characters' points of view: the scientists and administrators representing the Russian government, the employees of the power plant and other disposable workers, and of course the masses of people caught up in the disaster; and finally, for a close-up look, the wife of one of the plant's employees, who follows her husband to a Moscow hospital. All of these perspectives are handled well.

One person on another website said it was a good series but he was giving it a low rating because he couldn't believe it was rated higher than Game of Thrones.  Uh, okay.

Released in May 2019, with over a year remaining of the Trump administration, a show about a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union some 33 years ago probably doesn't jump out as being especially relevant to the here and now. Except, of course, it's not really about a nuclear accident. It's about governmental denial and subterfuge, it's about the dangers of rejecting science in favour of ideology. It's about the importance of a free press. It's about lies. It's about people who attempt to speak truth to power. And it's about the people who suffer when an entire legislative system is rotten to the core.

And with that in mind, it suddenly becomes a lot more relevant to 2019 United States.

Created, written, and executive produced by Craig Mazin (whose previous work inexplicably includes _Scary Movie 3_, _Scary Movie 4_, _Superhero Movie_, _The Hangover Part II_, and _The Hangover Part III_), _Chernobyl_ is directed by TV and music video veteran Johan Renck as part-horror movie, part-cautionary tale, and part-political treatise. Mazin began researching the Chernobyl explosion in 2013, initially as a hobby. Thinking he knew what had happened reasonably well, he was surprised to find how much he didn't know, and how much the majority of people didn't know, and it was this knowledge-gap that led to the show. Equal parts political deconstruction and painstaking recreation of what it must have been like to live through the worst nuclear disaster in history, the show presents a terrifying, nightmare vision of how bad things can get when hard scientific facts are made subservient to political agendas, and governments strive to undermine not only scientific expertise but the very nature of truth itself (the Soviet Union was a big fan of ""alternative facts"" long before the GOP). _Chernobyl_ begins and ends by asking the viewer to ponder the cost of cumulative nation-wide lies. However, it's just as interested in celebrating the heroes as it is assigning blame, and in that sense, it has an extraordinary sense of humanism.

The acting is immense, the writing is incisive and terrifying, the aesthetic is exceptional, and the show was a worthy winner of no less than 10 Emmys from its 18 nominations, including ""Outstanding Limited Series"", ""Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"", ""Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"", ""Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or Movie"" (for ""Please Remain Calm""), ""Outstanding Musical Composition for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special"" (for ""Please Remain Calm""), and ""Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Simon Smith for ""Please Remain Calm""). The show also won seven of its 11 nominations at the British Academy Television Craft Awards (including Best Director, Best Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Original Music, and Best Production Design), and two of its four Golden Globe nominations – Best Limited Series or Television Film and Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series or Television Film (Stellan Skarsgård). All in all, Chernobyl is that rarest of beasts – a show which lives up to the hype.

April 26, 1986, 1:23am; near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR. Reactor No. 4 at the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant (aka Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant) explodes, sending out masses of radioactive material. Fire crews are called, but neither they nor the local people have any idea of the severity of the situation. As the Central Committee tries to keep a lid on things, a commission is hastily assembled to investigate the disaster. The commission's head is Boris Shcherbina (a career-best performance from Stellan Skarsgård), Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and a devout party-man who believes it when he's told that the radiation released from the reactor is no stronger than that used in a chest x-ray. The commission's scientific expert is Valery Legasov (a mesmerising Jared Harris), deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute, who immediately realises that the accident is much more serious than the government are saying, and that the people in immediate danger amount not to tens of thousands, but tens of millions.

The show opens with the explosion and then follows Legasov and Shcherbina as they investigate why it happened and unexpectedly form a strong friendship. Along the way, we're introduced to a sizable number of characters, some well-known, many not at all – Ulana Khomyuk (Emily Watson), a nuclear physicist from Minsk (composite character); Lyudmilla Ignatenko (a heartbreaking Jessie Buckley), the wife of one of the first-responders; Vasily Ignatenko (Adam Nagaitis), Lyudmilla's husband; Anatoly Dyatlov (a quite stunning Paul Ritter), Deputy Chief Engineer at Chernobyl and the man in charge of the control room at the time of the explosion; Mikhail Gorbachev (a chameleonic performance from David Dencik), General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; Viktor Bryukhanov (Con O'Neill), director of Chernobyl; Nikolai Fomin (Adrian Rawlins), chief engineer at Chernobyl; Aleksandr Akimov (Sam Troughton doing a lot with a small role), night shift supervisor; Leonid Toptunov (Robert Emms), senior control engineer; General Vladimir Pikalov (Mark Lewis Jones), commander of the Chemical Troops of the USSR; Viktor Chebrikov (Alan Williams), Chairman of the KGB; Andrei Glukhov (Alex Ferns), mining crew chief; Major General Nikolai Tarakanov (Ralph Ineson), supervisor of the clean-up operation; Pavel Gremov (Barry Keoghan), civilian draftee into the clean-up operation (fictional character); Bacho (Fares Fares), Soviet-Afghan War veteran who trains Pavel (fictional character); Zharkov (Donald Sumpter), member of the Pripyat Executive Committee (fictional character); Svetlana Zinchenko (Nadia Clifford), doctor treating those with radiation sickness (composite character); and Andrei Stepashin (Michael McElhatton), Soviet prosecutor (composite character).

Thematically, _Chernobyl_ is anything but subtle. The opening line is ""_What is the cost of lies?_"", and this issue is front and centre for the entire five episodes. The show presents the Soviet Union as a place where lying and statecraft were one and the same, and in so doing, it illustrates what can happen when institutions of government put political ideology above objective facts, when egotistical politicians disregard everything that experts are telling them in favour of their own ill-informed theories (sound familiar?). It is, in essence, a show about the dangers of state-sanctioned obfuscation. The first episode in particular gives us some fine illustrations of a system obsessed with committees, bureaucracy, and secrecy, all built upon an unnecessarily complicated and rigid hierarchy. For example, shortly after the explosion, Bryukhanov explains to the Pripyat Executive Committee,

> _As you can see, we have experienced an accident. A large control tank malfunctioned, damaging reactor building four and starting a fire. I have spoken directly to Deputy Secretary Maryin. Maryin spoke to Deputy Chief Frolyshev, Frolyshev to Central Committee member Dolghikh, and Dolghikh to General Secretary Gorbachev. Because the Central Committee has the greatest respect for the work of the Pripyat Executive Committee, they have asked me to brief you on matters as they stand. First, the accident is well under control._

This sequence goes from the manager of Chernobyl (Bryukhanov) to the Deputy Secretary of the Power Industry (Maryin) to the Deputy Chief of the Machine Building Department of the Central Committee (Frolyshev) to a Politburo member (Dolgikh) to the General Secretary (Gorbachev). And if you think this is an exaggeration, all of these people are real, and this is precisely the sequence of how the information got from Bryukhanov to Gorbachev. As it's presented in the show, there's nothing remotely subtle about it, as we're invited to shake our heads at the ridiculousness of it all. An even more telling example of governmental secrecy occurs in the same scene, as Zharkov addresses the Committee,

> _From the Central Committee all the way down to each of us in this room – we represent the perfect expression of the collective will of the Soviet proletariat. Sometimes, we forget. Sometimes, we fall prey to fear. But our faith in Soviet socialism will always be rewarded. Always. The State tells us the situation is not dangerous. Have faith. The State tells us they do not want a panic. Listen well. True, when the people see police, they will be scared. But it is my experience that when the people ask questions that are not in their own best interest, they should simply be told to keep their minds on their labour – and to leave matters of the State to the State. We seal off the city. No one leaves. We cut the phone lines. Contain the spread of misinformation. That is how you keep the people from undermining the fruits of their own labour. That is how your names become inscribed in the hallways of the Kremlin. Yes, comrades. We will all be rewarded for what we do here tonight. This is our moment to shine._

This speech is met with applause. There's a lot to unpack here, but the line ""keep the people from undermining the fruits of their own labour"" is especially telling. Essentially, ""_keep the people uninformed so they don't ask us to explain ourselves._""

And, to a certain extent, much of the rest of the show depicts how that is exactly what the government has accomplished. If there's an overriding mindset amongst the Soviet people, it's a sense of civic duty, borne of a genuine belief in socialism and total trust in the Central Committee. Not all characters share this trust, but enough of them do to make it an undeniable trope. And for the most part, the show presents this sense of duty to the State as deeply honourable, worthy of a great deal of respect. How the State elicits, manipulates and exploits these feelings is being criticised, not the feelings themselves – a vital distinction. This is seen most clearly when one contrasts the noble self-sacrifices made by multiple characters, often knowingly giving their lives for the State and for one another, with the callous way the politburo look on such sacrifices – they expect people to give their lives because lives have to be given. As Shcherbina says at one point, ""_you will do it because it must be done_"". To the Politburo, the proletariat is not a collective of individuals, it is a single body, and it can afford to lose a person here and there without any significant damage.

Since the series was released, much has been written about the fidelity (or lack thereof) of the representation of the Soviet Union in 1986 – whether such and such a politician doing this is realistic, or such and such a politician saying that is over the top. Without explicit knowledge of the _milieu_, I can't really comment on this aspect of the show, but what I can do is cite another source that seems to suggest the show's depiction of the extraordinary unpreparedness and elaborate web of lies built by the government is most definitely not an exaggeration. In _Children of Chernobyl_, a Canadian documentary filmed in Ukraine just five years after the accident, we're told that in the weeks and months following April 26, hospitals were trying to treat patients despite having no wheels on their IV stands and barely any cancer medication whatsoever. A pack of needles cost 10 rubles (5 times the average daily wage), so cash-strapped hospitals had to reuse syringes across multiple patients. And as part of the massive cover-up attempt, individuals were barred from owning dosimeters, meaning they were unable to test levels of radioactivity for themselves. Indeed, huge numbers of people only became aware of the severity of the problem by listening to foreign news reports on short wave radios (which were illegal in the Soviet Union). After the accident, Dr. Alla Shapiro was asked to prepare a lecture on radiation for a hospital in Kiev, but when she went to the National Medical Library, she discovered that literally every book with the word radiation in it had been taken off the shelves and classified. On May 1, just four days after the explosion, and with rumours spreading about the nature of the disaster, the government urged people to attend the International Workers' Day parades, even in areas they knew to be heavily contaminated (and once word got out to other countries, the vast majority of the official footage of the parades in and around Pripyat were removed from the National Archives). So the show may have some factual inaccuracies here and there, and quite a bit may be exaggerated, but there very much is at least an underlying truth to everything we see.

Aesthetically, _Chernobyl_ is nothing short of masterful, with virtually every creative department knocking it out of the park. The show opens with the explosion, throwing the audience into the chaos and confusion that happened. We're given no info whatsoever on what caused the accident – teasing that out will form the substance of much of the rest of the episodes. However, rather than placing us in the control room at the moment of the explosion, it is instead presented in such a way that immediately establishes that this isn't going to be all spectacle for its own sake. We initially see the explosion in the distance, through the closed window of a character who doesn't even notice it happening until the shockwave hits a couple of seconds later. It's a wholly unexpected way to begin, presenting a massive real-life disaster not from the perspective of spectacle (_Deepwater Horizon_, I'm looking at you), but from a subjective human perspective. This immediately sets up the show's interest in people. The helicopter crash seen in the trailer is shot the same way – we don't cut between objective shots from outside and subjective shots from inside, which would muddle the perspective. Instead, the whole thing is shot from Legasov and Shcherbina's perspective, focusing on their human reactions rather than the fiery spectacle.

As for the cinematography generally, Jakob Ihre (_Quitters_; _Louder Than Bombs_; _Thelma_) shoots everything unfussily, with no real visual gymnastics. However, there are still moments of stark beauty and great artistry. The second episode ends with a dialogueless scene that Michael Mann would be proud of – a terrifying claustrophobic sequence shot almost entirely in pitch darkness with the only light coming from the torches carried by the men on screen. This episode also features perhaps the single most extraordinary shot in the series – a high elevation shot of Pripyat looking down at the residents being evacuated onto a fleet of buses. In the background, the power plant can be seen still burning, whilst the people and the plant are bifurcated by the flats in which they used to live. This is as good an example of thematic photography as you're likely to find.

And then there's the acting. Harris plays Legasov as world-weary and somewhat bitter, but a man whose disillusionment with the Party was nothing compared to what he feels as he sees them trying to cover-up and play down the most serious nuclear disaster in human history. Skarsgård's Shcherbina has an exceptionally well-constructed arc, moving from emotionless apparatchik to perhaps the most relatable character in the show. Skarsgård does some of his best work here when he has no dialogue, conveying everything with his eyes, movements, and facial expressions. And then there's Paul Ritter, who turns Dyatlov into one of the most contemptible characters ever put on screen. I would never have an imagined that such an amiable actor could have made me loathe him so much, but Ritter embraces Dyatlov's narcissism, insecurity, and bullying tendencies and takes them to another level entirely (RIP Mr Ritter).

As for problems, well, if there is one, it is probably that the characters are a little too black and white – the 'good' characters are practically saintly, and the 'bad' characters are almost pure evil. Legasov, for example, is depicted as a truth teller who disapproves of the Soviet system and cares only for the facts. In reality, he was a party man, and he initially agreed with the cover up. Indeed, his dramatic testimony at the trial as depicted in the final episode is entirely fictitious – he was not present at that trail, which lasted weeks and was considered remarkably dull, even for a Soviet show trial. The same issue is apparent with Khomyuk, a composite character representing the many scientists who aided Legasov. Watson is good in the role, but as written, she's fairly obviously a screenwriter's creation, embodying multiple hackneyed Hollywood clichés. She's a fearless truth-teller and truth-seeker, a hugely intelligent woman who is far superior to the idiot men around her (how she discovers the accident is especially preposterous). She purposely gets herself arrested and not an hour later, she's in a meeting with Legasov, Shcherbina and the entire Central Committee. Such a thing would simply not be possible in the USSR. The strange thing is, she's unnecessary. If Mazin wanted a prominent female character, why not use Maria Protsenko, the architect who designed Pripyat and supervised its evacuation?

On the other hand, Bryukhanov and Fomin are presented as utterly detestable, as ignorant as they are callous, completely uninterested in the lives of their employees, concerned only with their own reputations. In essence, many of the characters are either stupid or evil, or both, while the scientists are righteous prophets. And there's not a lot of ground in between.

Chernobyl is a disaster which, as of 2020, is still affecting crops and animals – in Sweden (the first country to learn of the explosion), mushrooms, reindeer, and wild boar are still screened for Cesium-137 contamination and occasionally declared unfit for sale. The disaster also had a profound effect on the geo-political sphere, and is generally seen as the beginning of the end for the USSR, whilst also serving as something of a wake-up call to the world's nuclear powers. At the time of the disaster, the Soviets were manufacturing a missile called R-36M (NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan), which was roughly 100 times as strong as Chernobyl. By 1986, they had 2,700 in their arsenal. Chernobyl really brought into focus just what kind of devastating power we are dealing with here. At its core, however, the show is more interested in what happens when governments stop listening to science, when every smart person in the room is telling a leader one thing, and he or she decides to ignore it based on nothing other than ideology or ego (and yes, Trump's attitude to the ever-worsening global climate crisis is very much the target). An exceptional piece of television in pretty much every way, _Chernobyl_ is as terrifying as it is compelling, as heartbreaking as it is eye-opening.

And all of this is not even to mention the dogs. I'm just not ready to talk about the dogs. | I was really excited for this series as I have read a good amount about the USSR and have a personal relationship to it, having been born in a former satellite country. But I came away disappointed. The series really drew out some scenes for no reason, to the point where I felt the need to fast-forward (for example, essentially the ~entire 5 minutes of going under the core to open a valve). I was also frustrated that the series started right at the point of disaster; I think I would have appreciated more context in a backstory section.

The series opens as an airstrike takes place in Lebanon, where the seeds of hate are sown for two young survivors. The story then cuts to the present day in Washington D.C. where we find our protagonist rowing in the Potomac River.

Jack Ryan (played by John Krasinski) is a Boston College graduate, veteran U.S. Marine, and in the present a CIA analyst who has been cross-analyzing databases trying to find possible terrorist activity in Yemen. He discovers a pattern of financial transactions that he believes could lead to the next Bin Laden, but his voice is squashed by a recently demoted department chief named James Greer.

Ryan takes steps to go over the head of his superior, and this immediately causes conflict within the CIA section where Ryan feels he is on to something. But Greer soon learns Ryan’s instincts were right, and the two end up flying to Yemen where they’ve found the man suspected of moving $90 million U.S. dollars to fund a terrorist plot.

Considering the show has already been given the green light for a second run, Amazon must be getting some decent reviews and at least enough hype to produce another 8 episodes. But so far this series is a snoozer, and without Krasinski and the benefit of 20 novels and five films based on Tom Clancy’s character, the show would be a flop.

Entire Review: <a href=""https://hd-report.com/2018/09/01/review-tom-clancys-jack-ryan-amazon-prime-original-series/"">Review: ‘Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan’ Amazon Prime Original Series</a> https://goo.gl/buiKxC | * A very pleasant surprise!

We've only just signed up for Prime and this is the first series I watched. I'm glad I did too, because the action is very exciting, the characters are believable - even though they've taken a few liberties on Clancy's originals - and I enjoyed how the focus was swinging to and from the terrorists' point of view.
Krasinski does a fine job as the young Ryan. Not too self effacing and nerdy and not over the top heroic.
It's shot in 4K too and the cinematography is superb, so I'm really looking forward to season two. | Wendell Pierce is a bit.... young... isn't he? I mean he does a great job, but after James Earl Jones and Morgan Freeman you would expect someone that at least looks a bit older. Someone not so Gen-X.

But then John Krasinski doesn't really look like someone that would have ""Ryan"" as a last name.... and, like Wendell, he does a good enough job too.

John Hoogenakker, however, looks like the role he's playing, but that's really because we all expected him to be Clark. At least the people that read the books expected him to be Clark. So, in my mind, he's playing Clark and not... whatever his name is in whatever episode.

But, Ali Suliman... he does a GREAT job so you get hooked despite the complaints from those of us who really wanted to see, well, the novels.

This isn't really about the novels. It's kind of true to them as in you can see it all fitting into the Ryanverse, but it's also a lot more straight out of the headlines for the W and Obama era presidencies and made in the Trump era where.... it seems more like a show from the past.

Either way, it works and it takes a little to get used to it if you are a fan of the books, or at least the Ford movies (which also took a little bit).

However, once you get passed it, the show is entertaining as all get out and.... for a streaming show, perfectly short in it's seasons, which is FANTASTIC given that shows like The Handmaiden's Tale, The Man in the High Tower, and so many other direct-to-streaming fair have more episodes than story.

Jack Ryan just enough where the filler isn't extreme and you can rest assured that the episodes are used to push the plot along and not just be filler.

AND THEN SEASON 2 HITS....

... and suddenly it's like they have forgotten how to write a suspenseful spy yarn, in fact, for the most part, they stop acting like spies altogether.

It was almost like they said, OK, we got viewers, the writers can be lazy now.

And all the tension and imagination that made Season 1 so much fun vanished in a puff of smoke.","John Krasinski, Wendell Pierce, Abbie Cornish, Okieriete Onaodowan, Louis Ozawa",1.0,False,0.0,2018.0

Most of prime time network TV is way too adult themed to feel good about letting her watch, and many of the kid shows are just too annoying for my tastes. Along comes iCarly, a show my daughter and I have watched from the beginning. The show is definitely aimed at kids, but there are enough funny moments (often provided by Spencer, played by Jerry Trainor) to keep me interested as well. All of the four main characters (Carly, Sam, Freddy and Spencer) are likable and have good chemistry. You get the feeling that they like each other off the set as well. As the first season is coming to an end, I can only hope they'll continue making more. I recommend this for any Dad (who has a sense of humor and still knows how to be a kid once in a while) to watch with his kid(s). | *A review of ""iCarly: Season One, Volume One,"" written in 2009.*  I will just state it at the outset. Although I am 40 years old, and ""iCarly,"" the hit Nickelodeon sitcom, is meant for my children, I honestly think it is the funniest comedy on television right now.

Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) is a junior high schooler in Seattle, living with her older twenty-something brother, pop artist Spencer (Jerry Trainor). Their father is in the military, stationed overseas, and the two live in a giant three story loft apartment with an elevator. Carly's best friend (and budding juvenile delinquent) is Sam (Jennette McCurdy) who lives with her as yet unseen mom. The two also pal around with Freddie (Nathan Kress), a technical whiz whose love for Carly is well known.

Carly, Sam, and Freddie webcast the internet show ""iCarly,"" and the Nickelodeon series follows their rising popularity, and dealings with everyday life at school and home. The DVD features thirteen episodes from the show's first season, plus some special features. I have listed each episode individually (they were all broadcast in 2007 and 2008), along with a capsule review, and my IMDB.com rating (1-10, with 10 being the best), and favorite line from the episode:

DISC ONE
iPilot (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Steve Hoefer)
Because this is the pilot episode, there is some pretty obvious plot exposition mixed into the story of how Carly, Sam, and Freddie decided to do a webcast. We also get to meet sympathetic school Principal Franklin (Tim Russ) and mean teacher Miss Briggs (a hysterical Mindy Sterling). Despite the newness and some awkwardness (Freddie luckily loses the shrillness after this episode), I laughed all the way through. 7/10.
Favorite line: ""Yeah, except he doesn't have Miss Briggs' crazy pointy boobs.""

iWant More Viewers (written by Steve Holland & Steve Molaro, directed by Adam Weissman)
Freddie and Spencer team up against Carly and Sam to see who can come up with the best idea to get more viewers. Hysterical from start to finish, especially the ""Messin' With Lewbert"" bit. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""Pee on Carl?""

iHatch Chicks (written by Steven Molaro, directed by David Kendall)
A science experiment goes wrong and Carly, Sam, Freddie, Spencer, and Freddie's science project partner Duke must find six baby chicks in the giant three story apartment. Consistently funny, with many memorable lines. My seven year old son's reaction upon seeing Miranda Cosgrove in a swimsuit? ""Carly's hot."" 9/10.
Favorite line (tough call): ""Wow, I've never seen dried beef make a boy so happy.""

iDream of Dance (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Adam Weissman)
The ""iCarly"" team decide to open their site to dance videos from their viewers, and are inundated with over three thousand. The trio slogs through a few hundred, fall asleep, and dream themselves into some nicely choreographed dance routines. The music is fun, the backup dancers are sensational, and Trainor's final dance sealed this as my favorite episode of the first season. 10/10.
Favorite lines (no way I could come up with just one): ""How dare you children boo a dancing Scotsman!,"" ""Because I move my legs in a fiery explosion of flailing limbs and floppy passion, wanna see it?,"" ""If he's a nub, then someday I want to be Mrs. Carly Nub,"" ""Get out of here, Gibby, this is my nightmare!,"" and ""Oh, Juiceboy's got a friend.""

iLike Jake (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Steve Hoefer)
When Jake, the hottest guy in school, breaks up with his girlfriend, Carly books him on the web show so he can sing, not realizing he is terrible. Strong plot and pacing, and nice work from Austin Butler as Jake. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""The internet can distort room size.""

iWanna Stay with Spencer (written by Arthur Gradstein, directed by Adam Weissman)
After Carly almost gets hurt by one of Spencer's nutty sculptures, their grandfather decides Carly needs to come live with him in nearby Yakima. Trainor really gets to shine here. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""What's her next phase? Stealing cars? Swimming with hobos?""

iNevel (written by Steve Holland, directed by Steve Hoefer)
My second favorite episode has Carly meeting Nevel, an eleven year old boy who gives ""iCarly"" a bad review on his hugely popular website after Carly rejects his advances. I don't know if he was eligible, but Reed Alexander is Emmy worthy as Nevel. 10/10.
Favorite line: ""Do you feel the rue? Ya feel it!""

DISC TWO
iScream on Halloween (written by Jake Farrow, directed by Steve Hoefer)
In this Halloween themed episode, Carly, Sam, and Freddie webcast from a haunted apartment in their building while Spencer tries to carve a giant pumpkin and keep trick or treaters at bay (he forgot to buy candy). A lesser episode in the ""iCarly"" canon, but still funny here and there. 6/10.
Favorite line: ""You gotta sick mama!""

iSpy a Mean Teacher (written by Steven Molaro, directed by Steve Hoefer)
Carly and Freddie decide to follow Miss Briggs around with a video camera to see what teachers do outside of school, and end up getting trapped in her apartment. Very, very funny stuff, with the entire cast doing well. 9/10.
Favorite lines (tie): ""My Aunt Maggie's boobs look more real than that, and they're ridiculous,"" and ""You dented my blow stick and punctured my squeeze bag!""

iWant to Date Freddie (written by Steve Holland, directed by Adam Weissman)
Freddie's new girlfriend Valerie wants to do a web show of her own, and tries to steal both Freddie and Sam from ""iCarly."" More fast moving than a network sitcom, with Freddie's first date and Valerie's web show the highlights. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""You won't get respect if your back's not erect.""

iWant a World Record (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Roger Christiansen)
Carly, Sam, and Freddie try to get into the Jonas Book of World Records by continuously streaming their webshow for over twenty-four hours. Typically surreal, and funny, episode with excellent supporting guest cast. 9/10.
Favorite line: ""I'm obsessed with the fattest priest. The chubby ones mean nothing to me.""

iRue the Day (written by Dan Schneider, directed by David Kendall)
Nevel returns to ruin ""iCarly"" just as they are getting the pop group Plain White T's on the webcast. Alexander as Nevel still cracks me up. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""You feel it, Carly? You feel the rue? Ya feel it?!""

iPromise Not to Tell (written by Dicky Murphy, directed by Steve Hoefer)
The final episode of this two disc set has Sam hacking into the school's computer and changing Carly and Freddie's grades. They then lie to family and school administration to cover for Sam. Chock full of funny lines, which make up for a couple of awkwardly played scenes. 8/10.
Favorite line: ""Hobos can't afford cable.""

EXTRAS

""Leave it All to Me"" Music Video
Cosgrove also sings the infectious theme song to the series, with a little help from former ""Drake & Josh"" co-star Drake Bell. The video is kind of meh, but the song will stay with you for days. 7/10.

Extended and Exclusive Making of the Video ""Leave it All to Me""
The ""iCarly"" cast also appears in the music video, and are pretty entertaining behind the scenes, too. 7/10.

Behind-the-Scenes Extras
These video bites are about ninety seconds long, and show the cast goofing off behind the scenes. All of them are naturally funny, although you won't learn any huge insight here. 7/10.

So, what can I say? I am a forty year old man who laughs at junior high antics. Although, the show's creator, Dan Schneider, is a comedic genius. He is about my age, and adds a touch of surrealism, some great running gags, and an excellent cast to Nickelodeon, making an even better show than his last hit- ""Drake & Josh."" My one complaint about the DVD collection is that a couple of the shows are out of order, which makes for some ""huh?"" moments when we meet new characters. I have been keeping up with Season 2, with ""iPie"" quite possibly the funniest sitcom episode in cable television history. I can find nothing bad about the cast, all of them shine, including guest and recurring characters like Freddie's mom (Mary Scheer) and evil doorman Lewbert. Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, and Jerry Trainor have such a great chemistry onscreen, it's creepy.

Sure, you might watch this and not find it that hilarious, and that's okay. I am completely immature. You can have your ""Two and a Half Men"" (which is only funny when that kid is on) or your ""How I Met Your Mother"" (which is only funny when Doogie Howser is on), I will take my ""iCarly: Season 1, Volume 1"" DVD set with its running jokes (Schneider's name appearing here and there, hobo jokes, the word 'nub') and giggle alone, waiting anxiously for Season 1, Volume 2 to come out in a little while. I told everyone at work I bought this set for my kids, and that is partially true, but I think I enjoy it more.","Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, Jerry Trainor, Noah Munck",1.0,False,0.0,2007.0

Ultimately I think this is a show that is uniquely appealing to the demographic it focuses on -- late 20s to early 30s -- which is likely a large part of the reason I myself enjoyed it.

It wasn't the best show out there, but it had it's moments and when those moments came it was far better than the X-Files.

Unlike the Twilight Zone revivals that lost the moralistic bent, the 90s revival sort of brought it back in full swing and made it feel more like a Twilight Zone revival than an Outer Limits Revival, but let's be honest, the Outer Limits was kind of just a continuation under a different name with more of a lean towards science fiction.

It also does a good job of staying within the genre of science fiction which is something that you scarcely see in shows post Alien when it started to meld into horror as well. So what you get is less X-Files and more pure Sci-Fi, which, by the 90s was refreshing.

However the quality of the story telling was hit or miss. You can compare it to Tales From the Crypt, another Anthology from about the same time, or the Hitch Hiker, which were both solid for nearly every episode.

The 90s revival of the Outer Limits wasn't as solid. You had some episodes that would blow your hair back, some that would entertain and nothing else, and those were about equal to the ones that just kind of fell flat.

The makers really should have followed the cheap and cheerful vibe of the 1973 movie. At least that was fun! This series suffers the post millennial habit of taking itself far too seriously ( think of the Daniel Craig Bond films) to the point that it becomes a chore to watch.

To Bernard Lowe, it is a fascinating experiment to take his mind off personal tragedy.  To the pompous writer Sizemore, it is a new artform as he composes narratives for the robots to carry out.  To visitors William and Logan it is wish-fulfillment, whether it is William's search for love or Logan's vulgar thrill-seeking.  To Theresa, it is just a business, and she complains that Dr. Ford's attempts to making robots more lifelike and unpredictable will eat into profits.   The robots themselves, who are supposedly rebooted after each ""show"", aren't supposed to think or feel anything -- but they are starting to do so. 

The show has numerous artistic references -- Dr. Ford's Michelangelo painting, the logo parodying Da Vinci's ""Vitruvian Man"" drawing,  Debussy's REVERIE, plus references to old-fashioned Westerns.

It is refreshing to see a show where there is attention paid to character and ideas as well as action. | I don't understand this TV show got such a big ratings. It's really unique with good soundtracks, but very confusing, unrealistic & repetitive. There are lots of things you might have questions which aren't answered & it gets more & more confusing especially with flashbacks, which I hate. Eventually it gets boring as well with same stories, with same characters who won't die. So many flashbacks, that sometimes you don't understand which scene is real & which past...

Original Review
(based on the season's first four episodes handed to press)
HBO hit a massive fail with the final season of Game of Thrones, but their quality regarding TV shows didn't seem to suffer from that. Westworld is one of HBO's biggest/best series, and in my opinion, it's the one that currently occupies the throne that GOT ruled for years. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy created an extremely complex narrative, filled with mind-blowing twists, and truly remarkable character-building. Season three promised to be totally different, having in mind last season's game-changing finale, so expectations are undoubtedly very high...

While it's true that Westworld packs jaw-dropping twists, the previous seasons differ from one another concerning this aspect. In season one, the twists serve the story, but in the second one, it felt like the story was serving the twists. This resulted in a few ""less great"" episodes due to the loss of tension and of well-balanced pacing, occasionally losing the interest of its viewers. In addition to this, most twists were so foreshadowed that the last few episodes lacked that powerful punch to knock us out.

Season three goes back to basics. Last season's finale works almost like a reboot of the series regarding its environment, rules, and even characters. Most of the series is set in the real world so far, but there are a few sequences in familiar places. Dolores' plan seems simple, but since this is Westworld, the last half of the season will probably provide a few surprises, so keep your eyes wide open.

I can't really delve into what each character is doing, but according to the trailers, writing that Bernard and Maeve have an essential role in this season shouldn't come as a shock. Both possess two very intriguing arcs, and I'm definitely interested in knowing how they will connect to Dolores' storyline. Aaron Paul's Caleb doesn't have that much screentime in the first four episodes. Nevertheless, he receives a well-written backstory, and his subplot not only tells the audience everything about him, but it also shows how the real world works.

My biggest compliment to the first half of this season is about each episode's structure. Every single episode starts and ends with something impactful. Each time I started one, I was instantly captivated by what was happening, and every ending left me with an extreme curiosity to watch the next one. Fortunately, I had the ""next episode"" button, but it will definitely be interesting to see how fans will react to weeks of waiting for the next (great) episode. Throughout each chapter, the story flows naturally without those confusing, exaggerated, twistful narratives of season two.

So far, it's a pretty straightforward main plot, but the unsolved mysteries still carry that aura of unpredictability, which makes season three a perfect structure to deliver a phenomenal, shocking finale. The acting continues to be top-notch with everyone just giving their all. So far, my standouts are Tessa Thompson (Charlotte Hale) and Evan Rachel Wood. Ed Harris (William) also delivers an outstanding display, but the two women are unbelievably good, especially Thompson. Technically, the episodes were still a work in progress, but the production and visual quality of HBO are impressive as always.

All in all, Westworld returns with a perfect season's structure to blow every fan's mind away once again. The real world looks incredible, every character gets a very intriguing story, but the first and last few minutes of each episode are absolutely fantastic. Each chapter instantly grabs the viewer's attention, and the ending leaves everyone craving for the next episode.

**Original Review
(based on the season's first four episodes handed to press)**

HBO hit a massive fail with the final season of Game of Thrones, but their quality regarding TV shows didn't seem to suffer from that. Westworld is one of HBO's biggest/best series, and in my opinion, it's the one that currently occupies the throne that GOT ruled for years. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy created an extremely complex narrative, filled with mind-blowing twists, and truly remarkable character-building. Season three promised to be totally different, having in mind last season's game-changing finale, so expectations are undoubtedly very high...

While it's true that Westworld packs jaw-dropping twists, the previous seasons differ from one another concerning this aspect. In season one, the twists serve the story, but in the second one, it felt like the story was serving the twists. This resulted in a few ""less great"" episodes due to the loss of tension and of well-balanced pacing, occasionally losing the interest of its viewers. In addition to this, most twists were so foreshadowed that the last few episodes lacked that powerful punch to knock us out.

Season three goes back to basics. Last season's finale works almost like a reboot of the series regarding its environment, rules, and even characters. Most of the series is set in the real world so far, but there are a few sequences in familiar places. Dolores' plan seems simple, but since this is Westworld, the last half of the season will probably provide a few surprises, so keep your eyes wide open.

I can't really delve into what each character is doing, but according to the trailers, writing that Bernard and Maeve have an essential role in this season shouldn't come as a shock. Both possess two very intriguing arcs, and I'm definitely interested in knowing how they will connect to Dolores' storyline. Aaron Paul's Caleb doesn't have that much screentime in the first four episodes. Nevertheless, he receives a well-written backstory, and his subplot not only tells the audience everything about him, but it also shows how the real world works.

My biggest compliment to the first half of this season is about each episode's structure. Every single episode starts and ends with something impactful. Each time I started one, I was instantly captivated by what was happening, and every ending left me with an extreme curiosity to watch the next one. Fortunately, I had the ""next episode"" button, but it will definitely be interesting to see how fans will react to weeks of waiting for the next (great) episode. Throughout each chapter, the story flows naturally without those confusing, exaggerated, twistful narratives of season two.

So far, it's a pretty straightforward main plot, but the unsolved mysteries still carry that aura of unpredictability, which makes season three a perfect structure to deliver a phenomenal, shocking finale. The acting continues to be top-notch with everyone just giving their all. So far, my standouts are Tessa Thompson (Charlotte Hale) and Evan Rachel Wood. Ed Harris (William) also delivers an outstanding display, but the two women are unbelievably good, especially Thompson. Technically, the episodes were still a work in progress, but the production and visual quality of HBO are impressive as always.

All in all, Westworld returns with a perfect season's structure to blow every fan's mind away once again. The real world looks incredible, every character gets a very intriguing story, but the first and last few minutes of each episode are absolutely fantastic. Each chapter instantly grabs the viewer's attention, and the ending leaves everyone craving for the next episode. Tessa Thompson is the absolute standout, but Evan Rachel Wood continues to prove her impressive acting skills. Aaron Paul should have more screentime in the last half of the season, but so far, both he and Caleb are pretty great. Excellent pacing, brilliant tension-building regarding the central mystery, and wonderfully-written dialogues. Four episodes, nothing truly negative to point out. Hoping for a second-half as great or better than the first. | Damn! I wasn't sure I would like this. Then again, I though the same way about GoT. And just like that show, I gave this one a try.
S1, was good, with a couple of shocking twists.
2, it got more interesting. 
S3, was also good, but some bits made no sense, and the main plot of this series kinda derailed from the original plot of the show itself. However, it did star Aaron Paul.

In any case, this show was really amazing; superb CGI, an ensemble cast (especially featuring Anthony Hopkins). And you see the characters evolve through the series.
Take Dolores, in Season 1 and 2 she started to be the new Daenerys Targaryan; for her true goal was to ""break the wheel"" of society.

Really good show. So I'm giving this 4 stars! | Let this be a lesson in how to ruin a good thing.  

It started off pretty great, I mean the first season I could really get into, but then the first season came out in 2016 and they were trying to make a compelling TV show.

Fastforward to season 2 and they got rid of all plot and characterization, and they started checking political boxes.  Does it fit nicely into left wing politics?  No, then change it so it does.

And then they made it more political and, honestly, that is when you lose people | Season one was very intriguing, if a little confusing. In season two everything just got way too gruesome. Season three kicks off a whole new level of cool. Of course, you end up rooting for the robots in the end. But all that nudity? Really? It's definitely a compelling watch but I'm still trying to work out why. | Season 1 and Season 2:

It worked because of tight coherent storytelling, compelling characterisations and intelligent narrative, that very wisely took its inspiration and direction, from the novel it was based upon. 

Then along lumbers this latest effort. Its manages to partly shift its focus away from the relationship between the pilot John Blackthorne and Lord Toranaga. In so doing, diffusing a key focal point of the story. A story which is essentially about the collision of Western and Eastern societies and cultures, which resonates in this period of Japanese history and beyond. 

The other key aspect of the original story that no longer works as well, was one of ultimately tragic love between Blackthorne and Lady Mariko. Mariko is a courtier who relies on her skill as a negotiator, to influence those around her. We see this clearly in the book and the original series. 

Instead, we now get a shift towards female warriors, which might reflect modern expectations but not those of Japan in the 1600's. Yes, there were female warriors in this period but they were not courtiers, trained in the art of diplomacy. Their role was in defence of the home, when male Samurai were absent or had fallen in battle, guarding women at court and at times, they were found on the battlefield.

Suffice to say, the new revised Mariko is anything but diplomatic. She rebukes male Samurai in the opening episode in the way that is jarringly and unconvincingly, at odds, with the talents, that define this character who is able to delicately and intricately navigate the conspiracies and intrigue, of courtly life.

The result is a series that feels clumsy and monotonous but also rather ignorant. The narrative in many cases does not work well, because the new series has discarded many of the subtleties and intrigue inherent in this tale, that are as much a weapon of the Japanese nobles, as the spear, bow and sword.    

Acting in this series is excellent, sets admittedly amazing and visuals  often spectacular. Regrettably the degree of meddling in the underlying story, for this reviewer, ruins what could have been, a promising updated series. 

In summary. Lavish sets, stunning visuals and quality acting can't overcome flawed, revisionist storytelling. The result feels awkward, unbalanced and lacking in coherence and direction. My advice, read the remarkable book and watch the wonderful series from 1980. | The level of historical accuracy in this show is astounding. Much attention to detail in the clothing, architecture, armaments, and cultural practices. It neither romanticizes nor condemns 16th century Japanese culture, it simply portrays it, good and bad, side by side. 

All the actors are doing a fantastic job. I'm a little underwhelmed with Sanada Hiroyuki's character, i feel he has been underutilized. The actor's performance is great, but i think the Toranaga character is not particularly complex in his portrayal. Abe Shinnosuke, Satō Tadanobu, and Hoshi Moeka are stand outs, turning secondary roles into amazingly deep side-stories. | Shogun is the new benchmark for epic television.

In the realm of historical dramas, FX's ""Shogun"" stands tall as a monumental achievement in television. The series, an adaption of James Clavell's beloved novel, will no doubt be met with acclaim for it's riveting performances, exceptional writing, and meticulous attention to cultural (and historical) authenticity.

The 1980s adaptation of ""Shogun"" was a product of its time, focusing heavily on the character of Anjin, the English navigator. While it was a remarkable piece of television for its era, it deviated from the novel's core narrative by sidelining Yoshii Toranaga, the enigmatic power player in feudal Japan. The 2024 series corrects this course, placing Toranaga at the center of the narrative, and the series is all the better for that.

""Shogun"" 2024 is a standout even in what many consider the golden age of television epics. It's been compared to HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" but ""Shogun"" carves out its own identity with a more focused narrative and a refined storytelling approach. The series does not shy away from depicting the era's inherent violence and sensuality, yet it does so with a sophistication that sets it apart, akin to the artful precision of sashimi versus the hearty mix of a stew.

The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, elevating ""Shogun"" to new heights. Hiroyuki Sanada, renowned for his role in ""The Last Samurai,"" embodies the master strategist warlord Toranaga with an intensity that captivates the audience. Sanada's portrayal is nuanced, oscillating between menacing and endearing, showcasing a range that few actors achieve.

Cosmo Jarvis's portrayal of the English sailor Anjin is less compelling. His character's journey from a shipwrecked outsider to a pivotal chess piece in the political machinations of feudal Japan is portrayed with an raw energy. Of the main cast, he falls into the background to an extent but his scenes with brilliant Tadanobu Asano's Yabushige are great. Both characters are more antagonists than protagonists but I doubt they'll outlive their welcome to most viewers.

However, it is Anna Sawai who delivers the truly standout performance. Known for her roles in ""Fast and the Furious"" and Apple TV's ""Pachinko,"" Sawai shines as both the translator for Anjin and the audience's guide through the intricate world of ""Shogun."" Her character is not merely a conduit for understanding; she is integral to the unfolding events, leaving an indelible mark on the series.

""Shogun"" 2024 is a triumph of storytelling, a testament to the power of well-crafted historical drama. It is a series that not only respects its source material but also elevates it. This is a series that will be remembered and celebrated, a jewel in the crown of television's current golden age. We may not know it yet, but this series might well be it's peak.

[Note there is a companion podcast series, which much like the HBO series ""Chernobyl"", is very good. Highly recommend this too.] | I preferred the original but this was so so good. | Shogun is a miniseries produced by FX, based on the famous 1975 novel of the same name. With a first season of 10 episodes, I can only applaud and appreciate the privilege of witnessing such a well-made production, with a fascinating script and an impressive setting.

The series follows the adventure of John Blackthorne, an English pilot who shipwrecks with his crew in Japan in 1600. This story serves as a thread to immerse ourselves in a sea of intrigues, betrayals, and power struggles between the fiefs over the future of the nation.

The series carefully presents the cultural conflict faced by the Portuguese people in their mission of evangelization in Japan. In addition, it shows us the severity, the courage and a concept of honor that sometimes seemed uncomfortable and impressive to me. The respect for families, the honor of the legacy, and the excellent female roles in a raw and masculine world, sometimes provoke the desire to stand up and applaud.

Shogun has the level of production, the war intensity and a carefully developed script that resembles a great saga. In my opinion, it is one of the highest points of television in recent years, which is a great achievement in today's times. | **A true masterpiece**

After experiencing years of fatigue from Marvel & DC, along with pervasive Hollywood trends and tiresome moral lectures in entertainment, I have finally discovered something original, unapologetic, and genuinely captivating.

This series is a refreshing change, offering a tightly woven storyline, brilliant acting, meticulously chosen dialogues, stunning cinematography, excellent pacing, and masterful editing and direction. It exceeded all my expectations.

The female characters exemplify strength and bravery. Mariko Sama’s fight in episode 9 still gives me goosebumps—it's one of the most courageous scenes ever created. Fuji Sama’s emotional resilience is equally commendable, showcasing true perseverance. This is how strong and independent women should be portrayed.

Overall, this series is a true masterpiece, rekindling hope that creativity in entertainment is very much alive.","Hiroyuki Sanada, Cosmo Jarvis, Anna Sawai, Tadanobu Asano, Takehiro Hira",0.0,False,0.0,2024.0

celebrity deathmatch,"Celebrity Deathmatch is a claymation television show that depicts celebrities against each other in a wrestling ring, almost always ending in the loser's gruesome death. It was known for its excessive amount of blood used in every match and exaggerated physical injuries.

The series was created by Eric Fogel; with the pilots airing on MTV on January 1 & 25 1998. The initial series ran from May 14, 1998 to October 20, 2002, and lasted for a 75-episode run.

Early in 2003, a film based on the series was announced by MTV to be in the making, but the project was canceled by the end of that year.

In 2005, MTV2 announced the revival of the show as part of their ""Sic 'Em Friday"" programming block.

I am really enjoying the show. It is funny and dramatic in turns, and very edgy in its plots and presentation. Sometimes it goes perhaps pushes the envelope a bit too far. One example is a corrupt character introduced in the fourth season. I tired of him quickly. It felt to me the actor was “doing” Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman. But these excesses are all in the pursuit of a story told well.

Sometimes it seems like they are cranking out conspiracy theories, but why not? Why should the far right have all the fun making up news? So if a liberal leaning show makes your ears bleed you will want to give this a rest or have gauze on hand to stem the flow.

Terrible script, pointless, weak characters. They should give it another name so as not to confuse it with the great series from History. | If you liked Vikings TV show, you will definitely like this one too and it's as interesting as Vikings.

Characters are interesting and well developed. I'm giving it 9/10 stars and that minus one star is because of agenda.

Whilst this series set the stage nicely for a European take on the WD saga, the second episode demonstrated writing that felt like it was better suited to an episode of ""The Famous Five"". Episode three is no better, with the whole proposition reduced to a gaudy, side show. 

The simple lack of plausibility and realism, the lack of any true sense of desperation, works against any notion that this is a hard nosed, post apocalyptic series, that takes itself seriously.

But some things bother me. But first positive things. Most of the main actors are very good, the landscapes are beautiful, and the period is also something that I personally just like to see.

The first problem that I have is with bashing Christianity and the catholic church, which is in my mind completely exaggerated and takes too much space in this show. In this show nuns and priests are portrayed worse than the mafia or KKK. I'm not religious, it's just portrayed misleadingly bad over the top. I'm not American and I have great respect for the Indigenous people of America (whom we just call Indians) and the great loss of life, land, and culture they suffered but blaming the Catholic church for that is just a lie. Also, the actress playing Teonna is very unlikable and irritating.

The second problem with the show is that some scenes are prolonged too much, like most of the love scenes. I just had to fast-forward such scenes because I became bored.

Third is a skewed view of right and wrong created in the show by the creators of this show. The main character hanging five people is OK, he just had to do it, killing a bunch of nuns and priests is OK to do as it is ""eating the soul"" of one priest (which is just cannibalism). Worse than all that is beating those girls in Catholic school are getting? I agree is horrible, but no worse than what 'good' guys and girls in the show are doing. But even that is not the point. The point is that that whole segment with the Indian girl and her reason for running away from school is too long, a lot too long, and unnecessary. Not to mention that in the whole season we didn't see even a hint of why is she and her story important. Everything that was happening with her could have been explained in 5 minutes. And that is the same problem with this show as stated before. Everything is too slow and the viewer gets bored often.","Helen Mirren, Harrison Ford, Brandon Sklenar, Julia Schlaepfer, Jerome Flynn",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

Season 2 of _Homecoming_ recently arrived on Amazon Video. I had no idea there was a second season coming, but having thoroughly enjoyed the first, this was really good news. 

Season 2 picks up soon after the end of the previous season and takes off at a sprint. We meet a character called Alex who wakes up in a rowboat in the middle of a lake and we go from there. The connection to Geist, the company at the heart of season 1, is established early, and we are right there with her as she tries to figure things out. It’s one of those shows that keeps you in the dark and makes you work it out as you go along. It uses flashbacks that overlap with the previous season to fill in blanks here and there, and it all comes off as a great package. 

The season is well written and one of the things in particular that I liked was that just when you think you have it all figured out, they pull the rug from under you. Things they show you at one point make you think one thing, then are later shown that they are completely different. It’s a great style that kept us interested all the way through. 

Like the first season, this second one has less than 10 episodes, and they are all around the 30min mark. So if you like twisting turning stories with lots of surprises, now’s a good time to get on board.","Janelle Monáe, Stephan James, Chris Cooper, Hong Chau",1.0,False,0.0,2018.0

**Rating: 10/10**

*Black Sails* is a breathtaking journey into the Golden Age of Piracy, where legends come to life, and the thrills never cease. The creators have done a remarkable job weaving together the stories of various legendary pirates, creating a complex and authentic world filled with tension, betrayal, and intrigue. The show's unique atmosphere, excellent character development, and complex social-political layers make *Black Sails* one of the pinnacles of the genre.

**Story and Atmosphere:**

The story of *Black Sails* is set in the early 18th century in the Caribbean, where infamous pirates struggle for survival and riches. The series masterfully combines real historical figures with literary fiction, creating a unique and exciting narrative. The writers have done a brilliant job interlacing the different pirate legends, crafting a narrative that honors these tales while adding new and unexpected twists.

**Intrigue and Power Struggles:**

*Black Sails* excels at portraying the intrigue surrounding the pursuit of power and wealth. The characters will do anything to stay afloat, gain power, or maintain their positions. The series vividly demonstrates how different social classes view and handle political, commercial, and military situations. The show accurately depicts how knowledge, education, and experience could elevate a person during that time, especially if they were sharp-witted and observant—qualities embodied by characters like Captain Flint and Eleanor Guthrie.

**Characters and Development:**

One of the show's greatest strengths is its well-developed characters. Although most of the actors were relatively unknown, they excelled in their roles, and their character development is clearly visible as the story progresses.

**Captain James Flint (Toby Stephens):** Captain Flint is the central figure of the series, a complex and deeply layered character. Initially presented as a cold and calculating leader, Flint reveals more about his past traumas and motivations as the story unfolds. Toby Stephens' brilliant performance makes Flint a character both to admire and fear.

**John Silver (Luke Arnold):** John Silver is one of the show's biggest surprises. Initially appearing as a mere opportunist, he undergoes significant changes through his alliance with Flint and his own ambitions. Luke Arnold does an excellent job portraying Silver's evolution as he navigates the pirate world and gains increasing influence.

**Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New):** Eleanor, the leader of the trading operation on New Providence Island, is an incredibly intelligent and ambitious woman. Hannah New portrays Eleanor's tough and determined character, who can think strategically while ruthlessly managing her dealings with the pirates. Eleanor's character demonstrates how someone can be a successful leader even in the midst of chaos.

**Charles Vane (Zach McGowan):** Charles Vane is one of the most feared pirates in the series, rising to prominence through his raw strength and ruthless nature. Zach McGowan convincingly portrays this brutal yet dedicated leader with his own unique moral code.

**Jack Rackham (Toby Schmitz) and Anne Bonny (Clara Paget):** Jack and Anne are one of the most intriguing pairs in the series. Jack, the cunning and ambitious pirate always looking for the next big score, and Anne, his fierce and loyal partner, are both highly entertaining and deeply complex characters. Their relationship deepens as the series progresses, and they face the challenges of the pirate world together as true partners.

**Max (Jessica Parker Kennedy):** Max is one of the series' most resilient characters, who rises from working in a brothel to becoming one of the most influential women on the island. Her story excellently illustrates the sacrifices needed for survival and how to find the path to power.

**Social Strata and Political Intrigue:**

*Black Sails* masterfully depicts the contrasts between different social classes and their impact on political and commercial relations. The series shows how knowledge and education played crucial roles at the time and how these traits could quickly elevate someone in the social hierarchy. Those who played the game smartly and shrewdly—like Flint or Eleanor—often succeeded, while others fell victim to their own thirst for power.

**Conclusion:**

*Black Sails* is an exceptional series that brilliantly interweaves pirate legends into a complex and thrilling story. With its outstanding characters, masterful storytelling, and depiction of social and political intrigue, this show is a true gem. *Black Sails* is not just for fans of pirate tales but for anyone looking for a deep, thought-provoking, and exciting drama that excels in every aspect.","Toby Stephens, Luke Arnold, Hannah New, Jessica Parker Kennedy, Toby Schmitz",1.0,True,3.0,2014.0

Just, wow!
The Mandalorian is not just a sci-fi, but a western as well. Pedro Pascal was awesome as the titular character. But Baby Yoda was the one who stole the show!

Great cast, great cast, great special effects. Just great! | If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com

Star Wars is a very special franchise to millions of people around the world, myself included. I remember when The Force Awakens was announced, and everyone got excited and pumped to experience this beautiful universe once again. However, with social media having a massive impact, the huge fanbase transformed into something so disrespectful and hateful that I find no longer fun discussing the saga with other aficionados... except for The Mandalorian.

If I had to bet that Jon Favreau was going to create such an astonishing Star Wars series that the whole fanbase would unanimously love, I would have lost so much money because I would have bet against this. There's no denying that the newest cinematic trilogy is one of the most divisive in the history of cinema. But there's also no denying that The Mandalorian belongs to the saga's universally beloved pieces of cinema/television.

This show is a near-perfect depiction of what the universe looks like post-Empire. Some are looking for scraps of the war to make themselves some money, others are trying to hunt criminals to collect bounties, like The Mandalorian or Mando for short (I will use the latter to refer to the character). Following Pedro Pascal's lead character, one that has no name or face throughout the season can be a challenging task in the sense that it's hard to emotionally connect with someone who we wouldn't recognize in the streets. Except we do.

Pascal's facial performance might be impossible to evaluate, but his body movements and attitude are so unique that Mando can be easily distinguished from the remaining members of his Guild. Obviously, his costume also helps to tell him apart from other Mandalorians. However, it's the rich, intelligent writing that surprises me. After a few episodes, I feel like I know Mando, even if he doesn't say much. I understand his life principles, who he trusts, who he doesn't... Yes, there are a bunch of secret past adventures that molded him into being what he is (I'll get there). Still, a simple action like not selling something, not killing someone, or simply a helmet turn a bit faster/slower goes a long way to show the audience who's the character we are supposed to support.

Every single episode is packed with entertainment. There's always some action, and it always brings something new. It can be an innovative trick, a different location, or new characters like Baby Yoda, who undoubtedly becomes the star of the show, and I'll leave it at that. I won't develop or spoil what everyone is or does, but I do have to mention Gina Carano (Cara) and Carl Weathers (Greef Karga). Both are important to the storyline, and both actors deliver great performances. If Gina gives her all during the action sequences, Carl uses his eloquent speech to provide the necessary exposition.

If there was a slight doubt regarding Disney's commitment to this show, the mind-blowing production level shuts down any question about that subject. This series doesn't merely resemble Star Wars, it *feels* like Star Wars. The whole season looks absolutely stunning! Gorgeous cinematography, fantastic set designs, and even the costumes of each species look amazing. Technically, it's one of the best TV shows of the decade, and every director does a tremendous job.

One other aspect I love is how each episode feels different. Each director brings his/her personal filmmaking flair, making every chapter feel new every time. Dave Filoni, who fans will know from the animated Star Wars series, does a good job with the pilot. Deborah Chow, who's the sole director of the Obi-Wan series, delivers brilliant action and a fast pace. Rick Famuyiwa puts a horror vibe into his sequences. And Taika Waititi (who also performs the voice of a droid named IG-11) ends the season with a thunderous finale. However, it's due to Jon Favreau's screenplay that everything works together so seamlessly. Impeccable writing, especially concerning the protagonist.

I have just one issue with the debut season, which is the overall plot. For a long time, it doesn't feel like it has one. It feels like entertainment for the sake of entertainment, just with compelling characters. Following Mando from planet to planet, from mission to mission, can be tons of fun, but if that's all the season has to give, then that fun can quickly turn into monotony (chapter five is definitely the favorite for the worst episode of the season). A lot of questions concerning Mando's past keep coming up, and while I understand that the series needs to have something for a second season, I also feel that a few answers here and there could have helped the story.

If there's one thing that The Mandalorian proves is that Disney has more than enough capabilities to produce a great Star Wars piece... as long as it has someone supervising it with a clear plan and structure, which didn't happen with the sequel trilogy. It isn't a coincidence that the two episodes with no involvement of Favreau on the writing are the season's worst. The apparent lack of a central plot can be damaging, but not enough to steal the ""best Star Wars TV series"" crown.

With an outstanding cast and talented directors, Jon Favreau offers the world the opportunity to live in the Star Wars universe, following Pedro Pascal's character in some of the most entertaining adventures the saga has ever witnessed. Technically superb, with stunning cinematography, excellent editing, an addictive score (it can feel weird in the beginning, but it grew on me), and amazing directing from everyone involved. Nevertheless, it's Favreau's writing and well-planned season's structure that make this debut a gigantic success. Undoubtedly, one of the best shows of the year.

Rating: A | I like this movie. It's excellent. | Well into season 3 its clear that meh strong female lead is going to take the place of Mando, I mean they haven't missed an opportunity to have him mess up, get captured just so meh Strong Female Lead can rescue him.

And it makes sense. All the Disney shows have been a bait and switch to replace the beloved character for Meh Strong Female Leads.

It's a shame. This... well it wasn't good, but it also wasn't bad and for Disney Star Wars not being bad makes the show pretty great.

I don't want to say it had potential for greatness, but it also didn't directly attack the fans so it was the best part of Disney Star Wars.","Pedro Pascal, Katee Sackhoff",0.0,False,0.0,2019.0

I can only talk for myself of course, but I thoroughly enjoyed this Dexter revival/miniseries. It's nothing as good as the phenomenal season four and probably is a tad short when compared to the seasons that precede the aforementioned, but it's without doubt much better than anything that followed The Trinity Killer.

It's an absolute joy to see Michael C. Hall back as Dexter, it's testament to his acting and the character that you genuinely love to watch him. Jennifer Carpenter's return as Debra is also terrific, as is the late reappearance of the awesome Batista (David Zayas) but also the newcomers to the series are enjoyable too. I got attached to the community of characters pretty much instantly, with the standouts being Jack Alcott, Julia Jones and Clancy Brown. I'd be up for seeing more, honestly.

I found the story to be rather engrossing, it got me tense and uncomfortable a fair few times. I see some say it's rushed, I won't quite say that but the last few episodes do feel a bit sped up - but I gained much entertainment from it and feel happy about the ending, which is much more satisfying than the original conclusion that we got. I see IMDb reviewers have the final episode as the serie's lowest ever, which is absolute rubbish in my opinion - borderline insulting, in fact.

I read there are rumours of a continuation of some sort. I'd be up for one no doubt, but I'd be pleased if it ended here too. | It's a decent sequel for the original Dexter. Let's be honest, original Dexter didn't have the end it deserved. No one like it's end. The TV show was begging to give it a good ending and I believe this is why this sequel happened and it does exactly why it was created - it ends appropriately which won't leave with you with questions. I won't write any spoilers, but I will say that it's super interesting and doesn't disappoint at all. I give it 10/10 stars.","Michael C.

Dickinson is such a well-written show. The way Alena Smith took the story of a young poet (Emily Dickinson) more than 150 years ago and turned it into something so relatable to the current generation was just amazing. 



It’s interesting how the entire story was set at a horrible time in history where the fight for women’s rights was still a blur and then the civil war was brewing and yet, the story was structured to make us smile and laugh. It was made such that all the passion of Emily Dickinson could be felt.



The way her poems were related to the instances of each episode allowed you to almost have a glimpse into the mind of the great poet that is Emily Dickinson which was in some ways sad because she didn’t live a particularly fun life (as she spent most of it in her room), but also very filled with love, happiness, and passion. 





The show was simply amazing and should be treated with a lot of respect for the writer, directors, cast and everyone who helped put it together. If not for the story itself, then at least for making people laugh in the face of such unsettling situations. This is very good one, a gem.","Hailee Steinfeld, Toby Huss, Adrian Enscoe, Anna Baryshnikov, Ella Hunt",0.0,False,0.0,2019.0

the andy griffith show,"The Andy Griffith Show is an American sitcom first televised on CBS between October 3, 1960 and April 1, 1968. Andy Griffith portrays the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. His life is complicated by an inept, but well-meaning deputy, Barney Fife, a spinster aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee, and a precocious young son, Opie. Local ne'er-do-wells, bumbling pals, and temperamental girlfriends further complicate his life. Andy Griffith stated in a Today Show interview, with respect to the time period of the show: ""Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.""

The series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. It has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best show in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, series co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The show, a semi-spin-off from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled ""Danny Meets Andy Griffith"", spawned its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry. The show's enduring popularity has generated a good deal of show-related merchandise. Reruns currently air on TV Land, and the complete series is available on DVD. All eight seasons are also now available by streaming video services such as Netflix.","Comedy, Family",7.6,4.86335650421076,4.983606621708336,False,Ended,2.0794415416798357,5.517452896464707,3.2188758248682006,"Paramount+ Roku Premium Channel, Paramount Plus, Peacock Premium, Paramount+ Amazon Channel, Paramount Plus Apple TV Channel , Peacock Premium Plus",No reviews,"Andy Griffith, Ron Howard, Frances Bavier",1.0,True,5.0,1960.0

Middle-class white, Piper Chapman gets put in jail and a very different environment than she’s used to and with very different people. That’s it really. Sounds simple and depressing.  But as we learn more about the people in her new social circle we learn that they each have their own, often tragic, story and explanation of how they got there and how they became the person they now are. Based on the real-life experience of Piper Kerman, it raises questions of corporate for-profit prisons, race, inequality and many social issues.

And because it was made in the early 60s it certainly has the most moralistic bent to it, and for a series like The Twilight Zone, it works and it sets it apart from all the revivals made to date.

Sure, yeah, the 2019 has a ""moralistic"" side as well, certainly more than the 80s and 00s revivals, but the 2019 morals are more... propagandist, more hateful.

This version, the morals are about individual virtue, about loyalty and courage and wisdom and not about... well, not about partisan politics and division. That makes a difference in the story telling.

You have lessons, like don't become reliant on superstitions that you really hardly see in the 00s and the 2019 revivals, and you only occasionally saw in the 80s revival. You have episodes that have a warning, a clear cut warning that serve as a guideline.

And then you have your pure science fiction episodes that, even then, come with a love of pure irony that made the series so well loved. The twists and turns are spooky and heartwarming.

Since he goes into great detail on a different topic each week, it depends on the topic as to whether Inenjoy the episode. Sometimes he takes matters further than just talking about issues. For example, my favorite show was when he talked about how easy it is to beget non-taxable status as a church, and to illustrate, the show started its own church. It was humorous, informative and the donations they collected went to a charity, not to buy a jet for an evangelist.

The other part of the show is the opening monologue, which I find usually makes some great points and produces laughs, but he also seems to push a joke too far for my taste, like, I got it already. And of course it is HBO so sex jokes come into play. Still, it usually is worth watching, especially when he tackles topics that interest me. | I don't know if this show was always this bad or Oliver lost his mind.

I managed most of the first tedious episode, before calling it a day. Lets start with the poor story. A story that makes Rick Grimes character look fragile, impulsive, whilst at the same time, indecisive and incoherent. The opening scene see's Rick cut off his own hand to escape from his captors, only to fall semi-conscious minutes later. Its a poorly thought through plan to say the least, that does not reflect the clever, strategic leader, established so convincingly, in the main series.

Given how ""revisionist"" Rick is being portrayed, I have an instinctive feeling, the show wont centre around this iconic character. No strong male leads, right? I was not surprised in the slightest either, by yet more dreary, woke nonsense. 

The very limited upside includes quality acting, its a strong cast. Sets and CGI are above average. That said, the pluses can't make up for the noticeable deficits.

In summary. Like all of the Walking Dead spin off's to date, at its heart, inconsistent and often weak, storytelling, lets the series down. An emphatic hard pass from me. Perhaps its time to let the Walking Dead, die in peace? | I didn't want it to end! But it has to have an ending.

5/5 stars | This is best spinoff of The Walking Dead. How can it be dead, it's Rick Grimes there. This spinoff covers everything perfectly and it gives us the good ending of the Walking Dead we all wanted. Thank you, creators!","Andrew Lincoln, Danai Gurira, Pollyanna McIntosh",0.0,False,0.0,2024.0

Recently started watching this show and for the first several episodes I was very intrigued. Kilgrave the super-villain (acted insanely well by Tennant), is compelling, and Jones at first is sympathetic, interesting, and supporting characters have promise.

Unfortunately by Episode 7 I had lost quite a bit of interest. After a while Jones - perpetually drunk, unwashed, sullen and angry - grates; she is very one-dimensional. Although what happened to her was terrible, other people have suffered at Kilgrave's hands, but no one takes it to the persistent pity-party levels Jones does, or does as good a job at alienating people. She's not coping, and snarls at anyone who tries to help her. She doesn't want people to get hurt because of her, but she is so emotionally crippled and wound so tightly by what happened it is difficult to trust her judgment and perspective, or sometimes even if she is sane. She can't see that every moment she lives her life in a broken way is a victory for Kilgrave. 

Episode 7 is a good example. After Kilgrave leaves her a terrible 'present', she hatches a wacky, unbelievable plot that she eventually convinces her friends to sort of go along with, against their better judgment. (Just the idea that a 'detective' would THINK you could get locked up immediately in SuperMax is absurd.) It's not even clear that she has really thought this through but her wild ranting and demand that everyone listen to her finally 'wins' people over. You get the feeling after a while any price is okay as long as she beats Kilgrave. Kilgrave is a bloody monster, but I'm not certain Jones wouldn't be okay with the entire world going to Hell if she could finally catch him. 

She's just too one dimensional. Her potential thoughtfulness and complexity is lost in a haze of booze, self-recrimination and self-pity. After a while she doesn't really engender sympathy but encourages eye rolls. 

I also haven't felt the connexion with Luke. Carnally maybe, but there is nothing that gives you a feel for them together, except for one scene at a food truck and protracted interactions in the bedroom. 

Ruben is a wasted character; I thought there would be more to him and his infatuation, but no. Malcolm and Simpson clearly have parts to play and I am still a bit curious what will happen but that is now really tempered. I was excited to see the next episode but I need time to recover after the mess that was 7.

It's not Jessica Jones, but it's also the BEST cinematic version of the Punisher to date, including the 1989 Dolph Lundgren version which is arguably the best movie version to date.

Now, I've seen people on IMDb complain about the lack of super powers and the violence involved in the series and, well, clearly they aren't really familiar with the source material.

Especially since The Punisher is essentially Dexter. That is he's a serial killer tolerated only because he kills the bad guys. But still...serial killer.

And with that in mind, you have a series about a killer that kills a lot of killers worse than he is. Only unlike Dexter, he's killing them with guns and not really concerned about getting caught or the evidence he leaves behind.

He's just a killer. And, well, it works. It's done right. And the characters are perfect.

SEASON TWO:

Season 1 I gave 10 stars. Season 2 did something so anti-Punisher that I had to bring it down to 1.

It did the Jessica Jones thing. The first season was amazing, not Season 1 of Jessica Jones good, but it nailed The Punisher better than even some of the writers in the comics could ever dream of (MAX clearly excluded).

And then it does the political thing and unfortunately the politics were ""Woke.""

Now with Jessica Jones the kind of politics weren't that important...they still killed the show...but at least the politics fit the character.

Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Luke Cage (to an extent) you can introduce far left politics and it would fit their character. Daredevil is defined more by being a Catholic...but even then you can take the character to the left and it would fit (just not as far). They are all essentially liberal characters....but the Punisher is not a liberal character.

The Punisher can't go woke, Jessica can, but The Punisher is essentially a serial killing super conservative authoritarian. He's not a nice person.

The Punisher is slightly right of Atilla the Hun. He makes Trump look like a liberal. That is the essence of his character. He's an authoritarian.

He's a conservative character, that is his personality. He's more of a Neo-Con than Iron Man, he's more conservative than Mr. Fantastic..and Netflix made him woke.

It is a personality trait that brings him into conflict with so many other Marvel characters, especially very liberal characters like Captain America.

And I realize that woke people are also authoritarian...but it's an authoritarianism that is the direct opposite of The Punisher.

So, not only did they inject politics into my escapism again (which I hate) but this time the politics where in direct contrast to the character's personality.

So congratulations Netflix, you messed up a really good show on two levels.

Injecting politics into a show is irritating when you are watching it to escape the bleak reality on the news...but when the politics contrast the essence of the character it's a tragedy.","Jon Bernthal, Ben Barnes, Amber Rose Revah, Josh Stewart, Jason R. Moore",1.0,False,0.0,2017.0

I've already been caught by a roommate when I was reading ""The Wolf and the Dove,"" because I found a paperback for $1 at a library and it was the only thing that looked entertaining at the time.

Anyway Hitchcock reminds me of the old pulp novels I pick up at antique stores. It reminds me of some of the pulp megapacks you can buy on Amazon... only in some cases the stories are a lot better with Hitchcock.

Hitchcock's signature was his friendly rivalry with sponsors, which probably helped his sponsors simply by the recognition.
It tough to rate an anthology, but most of these stories were very good. His best ones were with characters you didn't really relate with, but still felt something for. Such was the case for what I call his ""masterpiece"", with Gig Young and Robert Redford playing brothers with sky high superiority complexes in ""A Piece of the Action"", and with Robert Keith, Ed Byrnes, and Stephen McNally in ""Final Escape"", and with Mr. Haney himself in ""The Jar"".
Then there were some comedies. One in which he purposely made it predictable that a ""dining club"" was eating its members when they got fat enough. The dark comedy was funny because of how oblivious the member was for being the next meal, even though everything pointed to it.

Well, sadly, this doesn't really deliver at all. Henry VII - the first Tudor king of England - who reigned for almost a quarter of a century doesn't feature at all; therefore we are deprived of any backstory to the real focus character of these 38 episodes. Henry VIII had a reputation as a brute, a violent headstrong man with a penchant for women, power and coupled with his arguably even more ambitious Chancellor Wolsey we ought to have had a belter of a drama with just about nothing off limits! Nope, no chance - we have in the two lead characters the Tudor equivalent of ""Peter Pan"" and ""Wendy"". Jonathan Rhys Meyers is dreadful, and Sam Neill has all the menace of a wet sponge as the scheming Cardinal with designs on the Papacy. Regrettably, these lacklustre opening episodes sets the tone for the remainder of this really lacking drama. The storylines give the faintest of nods to this lively period of English history, but even the Anne Boleyn (the frankly awful Natalie Dormer) scenarios - which are the stuff of novels and dissertations the world over become little more than a fancy dress farce. We rarely see anything of substance emerge - the establishment of the Church of Engand is but a scant moment amongst the pantomime this has quickly become. Henry Cavill provides some eye candy as his best mate ""Suffolk""; Kris Holden Reid as the sexually ambitious ""Compton"" (he of the famous Soho London St, presumably?) - hell, even Peter O'Toole gets in on the act picking up Sir John Gielgud's mantle as the go-to actor for the role of a Pope (Paul III). None of the wives, including the aforementioned Dormer, exude anything by way of chemistry or personality, with Joss Stone far too attractive to be the convincing turn off ""Anne of Cleves"" depicted here. To be fair, a great deal of attention has been paid to the look of the series. The costumes are top drawer and the CGI complimentary rather than intrusive. That said, the whole thing is an hugely disappointing exercise in big budget drama with little focus on the quality of the writing. The casting assumes we would rather have pretty things to look at than actors who could immerse us in this exciting and turbulent period of history - and aside from Ray Winstone's terrible effort with the same character (from 2003) this is easily the worst portrayal of Henry VIII I have ever witnessed. Mercifully, the whole thing runs out of steam before the accession of his daughter (another Tudor with an enthusiasm for depriving Queen's of their heads) saving us from being subjected to another 45 years worth of this sappy Showtime saga.","Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Henry Cavill, Sarah Bolger, Max Brown, David O'Hara",1.0,True,6.0,2007.0

**_Season 1_**

When I heard the news that M. Night Shyamalan would be producing a horror TV series, I instantly got intrigued. For some reason, probably due to the tremendous amount of movies to watch, I forgot that the show was coming out at the end of November. Since no one seemed to be talking about it, I couldn't remember its existence until this week. I have no idea why people are so quiet. Servant is one of the best (new) TV shows I've seen in the last few years. People are giving all credit to Shyamalan, but I'm not going to make the same mistake.

Tony Basgallop created and wrote the show. There are five other directors besides Shyamalan, who only directs episodes one and nine. I love Shyamalan as much as the next guy, I've always defended him, and his name alone is enough to convince me to watch anything. He's the reason why I got interested in Servant in the first place. However, the mysterious premise was the aspect that truly captivated me. From the pilot until the finale, every single episode is packed with unanswered questions, enigmatic answers, and a whole lot of tension-building.

Besides being extremely well-written, the dialogues are filled with suspense and an incredible amount of tension. Every director does a fantastic job of keeping a creepy atmosphere, using opposite shots like close-ups and wides to create that uneasy environment. Most of the narrative is set inside the Turner's house, offering that claustrophobic vibe I love so much. Being mostly a one-location show, it never deviates the viewer from what's happening, maintaining the focus on each and every member of the family.

I rarely feel the need for binging a whole season. I enjoy waiting a week or so for the next episode. It lets me think about what happened, it creates a space for me to reflect on a certain character's actions or understand why a particular narrative decision didn't quite work for me. I don't agree that someone who binges seven seasons of, for example, Game of Thrones, will have the same emotional attachment to the story and its characters than someone who waited all those years for the final season. It's just a different perspective and experience. Nevertheless, Servant always left me with that feeling of ""I need to watch the next episode immediately"".

Now, I don't think it's a show for everyone, and I know that people don't like it when someone writes this, but I'll explain. Servant isn't an exposition-driven narrative. It doesn't answer any of the questions you have until the very end, and even then, it leaves room for different interpretations of the story. Every episode is very ambiguous and enigmatic, sometimes adding more and more questions than answers or clues. For a lot of people, it's a show that heavily relies on the final episode's revelations to ultimately consider it a success or a disappointment. If you don't enjoy this type of series, then it's probably for the best that you skip it.

However, if this is ""your thing"", sit down and enjoy this amazing show Basgallop created with the help of Shyamalan. Technically, I can't help but praise the cinematography (Mike Gioulakis, who worked with Shyamalan on Glass and Split, and also with Jordan Peele on Us). The elegant long takes are crucial for keeping the viewer's eyes on the characters, and truly listen to what they're saying. With the help of seamless editing (and the unusual short runtime, thirty minutes per episode feels like an odd duration nowadays), almost every episode goes like the wind.

Exquisite control of the pacing makes the show flow impressively well. The set and production design are always important in one-location pieces, and Servant doesn't lack quality in these regards. Subtle but effectively sinister score (Trevor Gureckis). It's the first show I watch from Apple TV+, and I'm thankful that the company gives the opportunity to great filmmakers to prove their worth instead of producing gigantic CGI festivals right off the bat. I left the best for last, and that is the cast. It doesn't matter how good a screenplay is if the actors can't bring it to life properly.

The four main actors are ALL outstanding! Toby Kebbell hasn't done anything in the past that genuinely surprised me, but now he demonstrated how good of an actor he is. He deals with long dialogues effortlessly, and his close-ups are the most captivating of all. Plus, the whole cooking sequences are visually eye-opening (though I advise they might be too much for the more sensible viewers). Lauren Ambrose seemed a bit out of place in the beginning, but once I understood where her character came from, her performance made total sense. Her display in the finale gave me chills.

However, Rupert Grint (Julian Pearce, Dorothy's brother) and Nell Tiger Free are two unbelievably remarkable surprises. The former gets out of that Harry Potter shell and finally shows that he's more than a mere Ron Weasley. Really engaging performance from him. As for Nell (who didn't have time to show what she can do as Myrcella Baratheon, in Game of Thrones), she carries the most essential role of all. She's the ""black sheep"" of the story, the conflict, the strange and out-of-place character. She needed to be absolutely perfect to make the viewer confused about her motivations, and she nailed it. Undoubtedly, she's the biggest revelation of the series.

I don't understand why Servant doesn't have more fans, and I can't cope with the silence of the people who actually watched it. It's a series that deserves a lot more credit. Boasting a phenomenal cast with Rupert Grint and Nell Tiger Free as the biggest surprises, Tony Basgallop created an incredibly intriguing, mysterious, suspenseful, and intense show with the help of the great M. Night Shyamalan. Brilliant, tension-packed, uncut dialogues help generate a creepy, uneasy atmosphere, elevated by some terrific cinematography (Mike Gioulakis). Filmed mostly in one-location, the set and production design highly improve the claustrophobic environment. The narrative is ambiguous throughout, it's not an exposition-driven screenplay. If you don't appreciate this kind of shows that ask more than answer, then it might be better to skip it. But if you love stories that make you think and second-guess everything, Servant is a genius work.

This time the series moves from New Zealand to the USA. No doubt looking to tap into the much bigger US audience. That said, its cast is predominantly English and it employs Kiwi talent in the production, from the original film. 

Its not a bad move but just like the original film I'd suggest its humour will either appeal to you or it won't. I like things a little off beat and deadpan but I honestly struggled to find the first two episodes funny. 

For me I'd describe this series as more ""interesting"" than amusing. There are other series in a similar vein, such as ""Being Human"". 

That said this series is different enough to merit attention.Particularly the vampires often absurd lack of self awareness of how much the world has changed around them. Their longevity hasn't made them wiser its simply made them old and anachronistic.

This series felt almost like an odd combination of a Greek tragedy and Agatha Christie’s novel Ten Little Indians (aka And Then There were None). I won’t even explain why as I want to steer as clear of spoilers as I can.

As with many cable series before it, in the tradition of Sopranos, Breaking bad and others, this story is dramatic enough to pull you along enthralled even as you may have qualms or doubts about aspects of it. Plus it has Sam Elliot, always worth a look, and great performant by two country singers, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. And let’s not forget the great ensemble cast.

The scenery is awesome, the soundtrack effective and the script is excellent for the most part. I must say I got really tired of the voiceover narration. Partly, I will admit, because I am not a big fan of voiceovers anyway, but also as if felt like teenager Elsa was passing along much more wisdom and historical perspective then someone her age would have access to. I mean, compare the girl’s antics at the beginning to the mini-lectures a few short weeks later.

But it was a minor irritant overall and only slightly repetitious, so it was easily passed over. The series was definitely worth seeing, and according to some information I have read, might provide some insight into the motivations and themes of the show Yellowstone if I also watch that someday.","Sam Elliott, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Isabel May, LaMonica Garrett",0.0,False,0.0,2021.0

While Hercules is a straightforward hero who nearly always does the right thing, Xena is a former warlord who longs for redemption but still possesses some of the savage characteristics that caused her to ruin other people's lives.  An unusual choice for the hero of an adventure show; in fact her name is Greek for ""the strange woman"".

The show was bizarre for its sheer lack of consistency.  For example, the afterlife: sometimes it was the Greek Hades, sometimes the Christian Heaven and Hell, sometimes Hindu-style reincarnation, and they were never reconciled.  As another example, the character of Joxer, sometimes a contemptible buffoon, sometimes a sort of Holy Fool whose innocence and devotion impress Xena. Another wierd feature was the way it jumped all over time periods.  Various episodes were set in the Trojan War, the Persian invasion of Greece, the age of Caesar, and one even during a midieval witch-hunt.  And finally there is the way they take a character who talks movingly about temptation and remorse and dress her up like a dominatrix.

When Calls the Heart has become a grotesque display of the cultural propaganda typical of male-dominated society. Femels are relegated to marriage, children, and home n' hearth. This century, femelkind around the world has experienced increased threats to our safety and economic security. Culturally, we have moved backwards. The burst of femel social progress evidenced in the late 20th century seems to have been oxidized. 

This show could connect with the wymin of today by reflecting on how many wymin were in the past a surprisingly dynamic group of doers and deciders. With all the wedding/marriage/family porn abundant in today's entertainment and media, I would re-title this show 'When Calls The Patriarchy'. Instead of honoring the femel deciders and doers of our past, this show panders to those who clutch on to the apron of yesterday's dearth of freedoms and wealth of injuries. 

The show could feature a femel character to honor Alice Guy, the brilliant mind who invented movies (and the film director) as we know it in the early 20th century. Instead, we get a retired actress, Rosemary, who loves her family but there's always something missing shi finds to do outside of it. Her passion for creativity and progress seems to be stifled by home/hearth. The show could feature another femel character to honor the most successful novelist in word rstory, Agatha Miller. Instead, we get predictably devoted Mom and her cheery son (well-behaved, at least) writing about mundane Life in an economically challenged community shi chose over a financially secure Life with her family elsewhere, better for her son.

When Calls the Heart (for honesty and fairness) once offered us a femel business owner, Fiona (and a beauty!). Now, shi's gone thanks to the glee of When Calls the Patriarchy. Shi could have been turned into a commemorative symbol of Martha Matilda Harper, the brilliant mind and ambitious spirit who invented the business franchise. Instead, we get the wife of a business owner (but, of course!), Florence. Lastly, it would be awesome --- especially considering the crackling contemporary politics recently --- to have a femel character that reminds us of the great Victoria Claflin, the first womin to run for President of the United States. Instead, we're stuck with Lucas, slow and naïve, whose political career was tainted by his past.

"have gun, will travel","Have Gun – Will Travel is an American Western television series that aired on CBS from 1957 through 1963. It was rated number three or number four in the Nielsen ratings every year of its first four seasons. It was one of the few television shows to spawn a successful radio version. The radio series debuted November 23, 1958.

The television show is presently shown on the Encore-Western channel.

Have Gun – Will Travel was created by Sam Rolfe and Herb Meadow and produced by Frank Pierson, Don Ingalls, Robert Sparks, and Julian Claman. There were 225 episodes of the TV series, 24 written by Gene Roddenberry. Other contributors included Bruce Geller, Harry Julian Fink, Don Brinkley and Irving Wallace. Andrew McLaglen directed 101 episodes and 19 were directed by series star Richard Boone.","Western, Action & Adventure, Drama",7.4,4.693236006856326,3.6888794541139363,False,Ended,1.791759469228055,5.41610040220442,3.2188758248682006,No platforms available,"GUNMAN WHO PLAYS GOD
Richard Boone stars as Palladin, the gunman with a card saying ""Have Gun, Will Travel"".
In the days when this was made, he was seen as a forward thinking liberal gunman, even into the sixties and seventies, and especially today.
It was like most TV series in that all the corrupt people were white males, and especially so in this one. A lot of people today don't realize this, but this was how nearly every Western was in the fifties, even on TV. 
The problem with Palladin was that he never minded his own business, even when he made it his business. He always wanted to play God.
In the show, he's always right, but his philosophy led too much to the modern day ""scapegoating"". | Have Gun, Will Travel offers, in the character of Paladin, a protagonist who was atypical amongst the lineup of 1950's western drama heroes. He was the erudite gunslinger, the gentleman-bounty hunter, the fixer of situations gone bad and a constrained vigilante. Contrary to what has been written in another review, Paladin didn't seek to play ""god""; however, his line of work may have required that he play any of the roles of judge, jury and executioner, depending on the situation. While not pretending to the status of ""god,"" Paladin could quote with ease passages from the King James Bible or Shakespeare, prior to dispatching the villain at hand. It would also be impossible for Paladin to engage in extensive moralizing, as the show made no pretenses about Paladin's choice to be a gun-for-hire to support his lavish lifestyle and other predilections. Contrary to what has been written in another review, villains were not limited to ""corrupt white men,"" and the series made no off-putting political statements of that ilk. Here, the reader should be reminded that 1950's westerns did feature villainous white men, as well as armed conflict with Indians, Mexican banditos and Comancheros. These were the bread and butter of TV western stories but were not political statements in themselves. Paladin was a considerable thinker, but this is not synonymous with ""liberal,"" as has been claimed in another review.

Many shows from the bygone era of 1950's westerns have aged out of appeal. Have Gun, Will Travel hangs on to its viewing enjoyment, primarily through the complex character and commanding presence of Paladin (Richard Boone). All fictional shows require some suspension of disbelief to achieve immersion in the story; for 1950's westerns, this is less of a stretch than for the litany of modern series pertaining to witches, zombies, vampires and CSI-type police dramas. I highly recommend this series, which is on my ""short list"" of must-see 1950's western shows.",Richard Boone,1.0,False,0.0,1957.0

""Loki is yet another extraordinary addition to the MCU, delivering a deep study of the eponymous character while introducing the fandom to the beginning of the Multiverse. The writers do a phenomenal job building the TVA and developing its detailed time concept that tremendously impacts the universe without relying too much on exposition, despite a couple of heavy deliveries. From the award-worthy production design to the addictive, memorable score, every technical aspect is near-perfect. However, the performances completely drive the show, mainly Tom Hiddleston as the iconic villain, but Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, and a few others also shine. Mixed feelings about the finale that might be slightly underwhelming for non-comic-book readers, and also about an unconvincing subplot involving Hiddleston and Di Martino. Still, it's the most important series of the MCU so far, so don't you dare miss it!""

Rating: A- | Loki started off slow, but man it picks up and keeps you at the edge of your seat through all the multiverse shenanigans twists and turns. This show is incredibly important to the start of the MCU Multiverse and it is a great place for the viewer to start off. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston is fantastic. Sophia Di Martino does an excellent job as Sylvie and makes a stuck up self righteous character in Loki vulnerable.

**Verdict:** _Excellent_ | Disappointed. Tom Hiddleston is not to blame. He is awesome as the God of Mischief, the story just wasn't compelling.

It was all a little muddled from start to finish. Tom always delivers as Loki and it is enjoyable to watch if you can piece together the chaotic nature of the story.

I did enjoy the variants especially the alligator. | Marvel’s Loki sees Tom Hiddleston at the top of his game. With great supporting roles (Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino and Gugu Mbatha - Raw are standouts). And top notch action sequences. This is by far the best Disney+ MCU series. Hopefully season 2 will not disappoint. | It's a low budget TV show, but it's not bad and Tom Hiddleston does excellent job. It starts a bit slow, but picks up later pretty well. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece, but it's definitely not bad and it doesn't contain that woke culture poison propaganda which is another plus. | Loki Season 2 was an enjoyable watch. The only episode I'd say wasn't enjoyable was Episode 3, but that is only because it felt a lot slower than the others, it was more story-building than anything. The end was good, if Marvel, for whatever reason, were to make a Season 3, I would have zero idea how they could build a story after the ending of Season 2. It felt finished, end of a season, end of a show, happy ending roll credits. Overall recommended watch. | I like that this show moved the story of MCU forward. But I still liked s1 better than s2. The overall quality of the show is very good, and it’s definitely recommended for people that plan to continue their time investment into MCU. | The God of Mischief is back, and man, does he deliver. _Loki_, the new Marvel series on Disney+, combines the zany inventiveness of _WandaVision_ with the buddy-comedy rapport we were all missing in _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_. Right from the first episode, you know you’re in for a wild, reality-bending ride. With its ambitious, time-hopping premise and eye-popping production design, _Loki_ hits all the right notes, proving Marvel knows exactly how to keep fans on the edge of their seats.

First off, let’s talk about the visuals. Hands down, this show’s VFX are a total game changer—not just for Disney+ content but even for the MCU films. We’re talking mind-blowing cinematography and jaw-dropping set pieces that elevate every scene. The production design is so intricate, you can’t help but lose yourself in this expansive, multiversal playground. Every detail feels iconic, from the retro-futuristic vibes of the Time Variance Authority (TVA) to the gorgeous, apocalyptic landscapes that are straight-up unforgettable.

But it’s not all about the aesthetics—this show has heart and smarts. Loki fans, your boy is finally front and center, and Tom Hiddleston is giving us a Loki with layers we’ve never seen before. Sure, we’ve always known he was the villain with a tragic backstory, but now? Now, Hiddleston is diving deep into identity, purpose, and the big, existential question of free will. His journey feels fresh and, dare I say, more relatable than ever. You can tell Hiddleston is fully trusting the process, and the payoff is some real character evolution that hits differently this time around.

And can we talk about the bromance we didn’t know we needed? Hiddleston and Owen Wilson as Mobius M. Mobius—this duo is pure gold. Their banter is sharp, hilarious, and surprisingly emotional, with Wilson bringing that dry, deadpan humor that balances Loki’s chaotic energy. It’s like your classic grizzled detective paired with an unpredictable trickster, and it’s working, big time. Watching them riff off each other is a joy in itself, adding that much-needed levity while still pushing the plot forward.

The show also brings a lot of heavy Marvel nerd content, especially in the worldbuilding department. Casual fans are going to get hooked by the clever plot twists and quirky TVA shenanigans, but hardcore fans? They’re gonna lose their minds with the deeper, next-level storytelling. _Loki’s_ multiversal misadventures open up so many doors for the MCU that we’ve never seen explored in live-action. The possibilities feel endless, and it’s clear Marvel is laying the groundwork for something massive.

And let’s not forget Sophia Di Martino as Sylvie. Her introduction shakes things up in the best way, providing a fresh dynamic that challenges Loki in ways we haven’t seen before. Without giving too much away, let’s just say Sylvie adds a layer of unpredictability that keeps you on your toes—and the chemistry between her and Hiddleston? Electric.

Halfway through the season, _Loki_ becomes proof that Marvel’s small-screen ventures are more than just filler—they’re expanding the universe in ways that the movies can’t. The show isn’t afraid to lean into its weirdness, and honestly, that’s what makes it so fun. Whether it’s the quirky TVA bureaucracy or the trippy multiverse logic, _Loki_ keeps you glued with its bold, clever storytelling and emotional depth.

With time travel, crime-solving, and a ton of moral questions packed in, _Loki_ is ambitious, stylish, and everything we hoped it would be. It’s that perfect balance of action-packed spectacle and introspective character study. And if the show keeps leaning into that multiverse madness, it’s going to be a glorious ride for fans. This is Loki as we’ve never seen him before—still chaotic, still hilarious, but now? Now, he’s got a shot at real redemption.

the penguins of madagascar,"The Penguins of Madagascar is an American CGI animated television series airing on Nickelodeon. It stars nine characters from the DreamWorks Animation animated film Madagascar: The penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico; the lemurs King Julien, Maurice, and Mort; and Mason and Phil the chimpanzees. Characters new to the series include Marlene the otter and a zookeeper named Alice. It is the first Nicktoon produced with DreamWorks Animation.

A pilot episode, ""Gone in a Flash"", aired as part of ""Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend"" on November 29, 2008, and The Penguins of Madagascar became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere.

Although the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, The Penguins of Madagascar does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place ""not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe.""","Animation, Comedy",7.444,4.686160137192478,5.924255797414532,False,Ended,1.0986122886681098,5.003946305945459,2.3978952727983707,"Movistar Plus+ Ficción Total , Now TV, Paramount Plus, Telia Play, Amazon Prime Video, Go3, Tele2 Play, Viaplay, Paramount+ Roku Premium Channel, TV 2, O2 TV, Voyo, Paramount Plus Basic with Ads, Paramount Plus Apple TV Channel , Amazon Prime Video with Ads, Hulu, Sky Go, Claro video, Prima Plus, Paramount+ Amazon Channel, Allente, SkyShowtime, MovistarTV, Paramount Plus Premium",No reviews,"Tom McGrath, Jeff Bennett, James Patrick Stuart, John DiMaggio, Danny Jacobs",1.0,True,1.0,2008.0

I didn't want to just watch the movie and be done with that because I heard a lot of great things about the show and I enjoyed catching a few episodes whenever I was up late on NickToons as a kid. But now I had an excuse to finally watched this certified classic. 

It was overall a great show with a very charming cast of characters. I liked seeing them just be kids without trying to pretend that it's something it isn't. It is just a relaxing slice-of-life show where kids deal with every day problems. The show even dealt with some serious topics which was welcome and very ahead of its time. Arnold is such a compassionate and caring lead, Helga is the living proof that female simps exist and I love seeing all her misadventures, I didn't think Gerald was a  very good friend mostly because how often he sides with the other kids in situations but I did occasionally get a few chuckles out of him, Harold seems to be the stereotypical fat ""bully"", but I like how he isn't just a bully and they don't really lean on his weight problem unless it was the focus of an episode. I love how cheerful Eugene is even when he always gets tortured throughout the series, Sid's excessive nature kinda got on my nerves at a few points, Phoebe was very enjoyable, Rhonda was the best kind of enjoyably unlikable, I wish I had someone like him in my life, and Stinky is the epicest character to ever ever!!! Most of the episodes are just good instead of great and reason I gave it this high rating is because how consistent the quality was. Like for the entire second of the show, there were only 4 to 5 episodes I didn't like which is extremely impressive for an 8-year run. Yeah, it got a little rehashy towards to later seasons and not every character was enjoyable or likable, but that's to be expected, but I think it's good stuff far outweighs its bad. I don't really have a ton to say compared to shows like Scooby-Doo: Mystery Inc. or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003) because its not story-driven, but I didn't really mind.

Our daughter is atypically autistic herself, but with deafness and a learning disability, she doesn’t resemble  Sam much at all.

It is a very good program overall. We watched the three seasons fairly quickly. I must admit that having Sam talk into the camera at the beginning of every episode, and sometimes during the show, got rather old for me. But it serves the purpose of introducing the theme of each episode, and can fill in details rather quickly. A few of the supporting characters are interesting and they all do a good job, even if a couple of them are nearly stereotypical rather than just Sam’s ‘atypical.’

So I recommend the show and am looking forward to the next series.

*** Having watched the fourth session now, I am adding a few more words. This season (the last maybe?) is more of the same as what came before, which is mostly a good thing. It centers around Sam still but continues to develops subplots around everyone except Evan, who was perhaps too nice a person to continue writing dramatic material for and who is a very minor character now. Everyone else shares in the excellent writing and grow as characters; sometimes in subtle or complex ways, as with Elsa, who clearly exhibits character growth, but who is still who she is.

I know there are a lot of bad reasons to hate good movies and shows: racism, misogyny, class snobbery, a stubborn anger about any kind of change or progress, and so on. But I am having trouble thinking of a reason to hate Atypical. Doing so would perhaps reveal a lot more about the hater  than about the program. I wonder if there is any potential for human growth in that type of person. | The heartwarming story of Sam, a boy with autism, and his over-protective mother, dependable father, caring sister, and loyal friend. The character development is solid and the predicaments Sam finds himself in are natural and uncontrived.

When _Agatha All Along_ was announced as a spinoff to the acclaimed _WandaVision_, expectations soared. How could anything live up to the vibrant, genre-bending magic of its predecessor? The answer: by conjuring a show that embraces its own quirks, doubles down on emotional storytelling, and takes viewers on a spellbinding ride down the legendary Witches’ Road. Marvel Studios and creator Jac Schaeffer deliver a series that feels simultaneously intimate and expansive—a darkly whimsical tale with Kathryn Hahn’s devious charm at its center.

**Plot and Characters: A Coven of Misfits**

Picking up three years after _WandaVision_, the show begins with Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn) still trapped in her Agnes persona, living a humdrum life as a Westview police detective. It’s a gritty setup with a supernatural twist, as a Jane Doe case and the arrival of Joe Locke’s mysterious Teen catalyze Agatha’s journey to reclaim her identity and power. Alongside her is an eclectic coven: Patti LuPone’s diviner Lilia Calderu, Sasheer Zamata’s potion-wielding Jennifer Kale, Ali Ahn’s haunted Alice Wu-Gulliver, and Aubrey Plaza’s enigmatic Rio Vidal (aka Lady Death). Each character brings a distinct energy, and their uneasy alliance is rife with tension and begrudging camaraderie.

Kathryn Hahn continues to dazzle as Agatha, infusing every line with delicious wit and layered vulnerability. Her scenes with Aubrey Plaza are a highlight, their simmering chemistry electric as they navigate a past steeped in betrayal. Plaza, playing the sardonic, chaotic Vidal, commands attention, especially when her true nature as Death is revealed in Episode 7. Joe Locke’s Teen provides a surprising emotional anchor, and his mysterious connection to Agatha hints at the deeper wounds she carries.

**Themes and Tone: A Witchy Adventure with Depth**

Jac Schaeffer’s magic lies in balancing spectacle with substance. While the Witches’ Road is a visually surreal marvel, complete with vivid colors and practical effects that evoke an ’80s horror vibe, the series shines brightest when exploring its themes. At its core, _Agatha All Along_ is a story of redemption, self-discovery, and power. It doesn’t shy away from the darker roots of witchcraft, confronting themes like misogyny and generational trauma while celebrating the strength of its female characters.

This tonal balance extends to the writing, which skillfully marries campy humor with poignant moments. Agatha’s transformation back to herself in Episode 1 is a standout—a noir detective peeling away layers of forced personas to reclaim her truth. The show also embraces episodic storytelling, with trials on the Witches’ Road that test the coven’s unity and personal resilience. From Alice’s haunting family curse to Jennifer’s struggle to reclaim her bound powers, each arc adds richness to the overarching journey.

**Standout Episodes: A Spellbinding Journey**

Among the nine episodes, several stand out as masterclasses in storytelling:

**Episode 1: “Seekest Thou the Road”** establishes Agatha’s fragmented identity with a detective noir twist, culminating in her cathartic reawakening.
**Episode 3: “Through Many Miles / Of Tricks and Trials”** takes the coven to the eerie Witches’ Road Mansion, blending psychological horror with a trial of poison and hallucinations.
**Episode 7: “Death’s Hand in Mine”** delivers a haunting blend of sacrifice and revelation as Lilia Calderu’s ultimate act of redemption unravels her fragmented life, while Rio’s shocking identity as Death shatters the coven’s fragile trust in a tarot-laden trial of fate and free will.
**Episode 9: “Maiden Mother Crone”** wraps up the Witches’ Road saga with an emotional finale that leaves Agatha poised for future adventures while resolving the coven’s trials in deeply satisfying ways.

**Visuals and Style: Practical Magic at Its Finest**

Visually, _Agatha All Along_ is a feast. Its practical effects—a conscious departure from CGI-heavy Marvel fare—lend the series a tactile, almost dreamlike quality. Every magical element, from the fog-draped Witches’ Road to the eerie glow of fireflies, was crafted with painstaking attention to detail. The commitment to practical effects extended to action sequences, such as Episode 7’s dramatic sword drop, where actual metal blades were dropped from the ceiling with precision mapping, adding an edge of realism and danger.

The Witches’ Road, in particular, stands out as a masterstroke of set design. Built twice to achieve the perfect scale, the final version is a rich tapestry of mud pits, mushrooms, and glowing flora—all filmed in-camera to enhance its tangible, studio-bound aesthetic. This hands-on approach immersed the actors in the environment, bringing authenticity to their performances and grounding the fantastical elements of the series in reality. The physical demands of navigating the road’s uneven terrain, paired with the magical atmosphere created by fog and glowing mushrooms, enhanced both the storytelling and the visual experience.

By embracing practical effects and studio-built sets, the series pays homage to the golden age of fantasy filmmaking while adding layers of depth to its narrative. This approach makes the Witches’ Road feel like a character in its own right—otherworldly, dangerous, and entirely unforgettable. Music plays a recurring role, too, with the _Ballad of the Witches’ Road_ threading through key moments, adding a haunting resonance.

**Final Thoughts: A Bewitching Success**

While it doesn’t quite match _WandaVision’s_ genre-defining brilliance, _Agatha All Along_ forges its own path, embracing its quirks and delivering an emotionally resonant, spellbinding tale. It’s a bold entry in the MCU’s television experiment, proving that magic doesn’t always have to be about explosions and world-ending stakes—sometimes, it’s in the characters, the journey, and the haunting echo of a song.

If this truly marks the end of Kathryn Hahn’s tenure as Agatha, it’s a fitting, triumphant conclusion. But if the final notes are any hint, there’s still room for more cackling chaos—and honestly?

There were hilarious moments, and there were serious, heart wrenching moments.
We said goodbye to Henry Blake and hello to Sherman Potter, goodbye to Trapper and hello to BJ, and goodbye (and good riddance) to Frank Burns and hello to Charles Winchester. And we had a definite goodbye to Radar.

But there will always be iconic moments from drinking spirits in ""the swamp"" to Klinger in dresses!

M*A*S*H was a truly fantastic and brilliant sitcom.
Glad I got the whole series on boxset DVD! | This Korean War medical team unit is really two shows.
So, it's rated in two parts.
MASH is sort of four different shows. I've read the book. I've seen the movie, and I've seen the two different formats of the TV show.
The book was much like the first show, where Major Burns is a total scapegoat. There's no way to believe that Hawkeye is a god and Burns is responsible for every terrible thing that ever happened. 
That's the book and the Larry Linville portion of the series. Linville himself knew this was a career ending role, and that the character of Burns was ridiculous.
It did make for funny moments, but the same funny moments that Nazis endorsed when they made Jews their scapegoats.
The first part of MASH is simply an instruction manual for choosing a scapegoat. 
When people watch something like this, they aren't concerned with ""reality"". They're being taught a more. The more being taught isn't to blame the creepy guy for creepy things that he does. That's because no one really knows that much about anyone else.
What is being taught, and the writers and directors of all books and TV shows and movies know this, is the surface view. What is being taught in MASH before Stiers is to just pick a scapegoat. That's all. That's the message.
So, even though the slapstick humor is funny, I give the first era of the TV show a 1/10. It's teaching discrimination and hate without a cause. 
During the first portion, the surgical army unit doctors do perform in a realistic setting, so to speak, and that makes it worse, because it can't be laughed away when they teach people to be modern day Nazis looking for the modern day Jew. Totally worse. 
It's also very dated, because it doesn't take into account the date. Being ""dated"" is misunderstood by ""fan boys"". It doesn't mean what they think. They think it means people from 1952 who act like characters from 1953 are dated. They think a character from 1952 should know about eight track tapes, DVDs, Donald Trump, etc. 
Being ""dated"" actually means that someone from 1952 does know about eight track tapes, DVDs, and Donald Trump. That's ""dated"".
That's the problem with MASH. The ""liberal"" from 1952 would be more like Trapper John. He would be the very far left. Hawkeye would be shot as a traitor, no matter how good of a doctor he claimed he was.
Which is another thing. The MASH book and the Linville era of MASH is like listening to Sinbad tell Hindbad of his voyages. You know he's lying. There's no credibility of character.
Now, the later MASH sees the writers realizing what they've done. Stiers as Winchester is the most credible character of the entire series. This is what a doctor in 1952 would be. Also Honeycutt and Potter. The characters became much more credible, though the humor became drier.
The later part of the series was 9/10. There were still some bits of contrived propaganda, but it was much subtler.
The character of Nurse Hot Lips was worse than that of Burns. She was a worse monster than he was. She had no allegiance at all, and couldn't be trusted. She tried to make underlings nervous in a war zone where being nervous could kill or cripple you, and that cannot be an accident from a major. I kept hoping she would be fragged. There is no way you could trust that monster to be on your side.
The character of Father Mulcahy was also out of touch with the era. He was the epitome of ""dated"", being a 1990 liberal preacher in 1942. As far as credibility goes, he was as bad as Burns.
It was later in the series when the four non coms got more notice. There was always Radar and Klinger, but they were extreme polar opposites. The Rizzo and Igor were added, and they were a bit extreme, even for 1942. Still, they gave more of a balance. Especially Igor, although his character should have been written better, since he was the ""moderate"" enlisted man. As a moderate, for instance, he shouldn't have been from the New York-New Jersey area. That was too contrived to please that area.
The ""scapegoat"" era was so corrupt that it took the rating down for this more than just 1 and 9 equals 10 for an average of 5. Thus, it gets a 4/10 rating.","Alan Alda, Mike Farrell, Harry Morgan, Loretta Swit, David Ogden Stiers",1.0,True,13.0,1972.0

**SEASON 02:**

It's a cool series. But I did not think they would renew it for the second season. The episodes were doubled, and I think it deserved that, because each episode were very enjoyable. The first season was an intro, but I felt very comfortable with this. More characters added, though the romance side of the tale is yet to be tapped. Maybe I think I know how it's going to turn out, but the finale of this season created more curiosity, going for the third. Yes, they have renewed the series, that's a wonderful news and it is going to be aired at the end of this year (2017).

I love the cast. I won't say it was just America Ferrera and Ben Feldman's show, but each and everyone had their own space with their awesome characters. It is definitely going to be one of the best NBC comedy programme. As how this ended, I think it is going to be kind of a restart in the next season. But still I hope it stays the same, particularly retains all the characters, and maybe a couple of new ones as well.

Since I haven't reviewed the first season, I wanted to say that it kind of looks inspired by 'Employee of the Month', but they say it was a crossover of 'Mindy Project' starred by Ferrera. I haven't seen that, but that looks nice, maybe one day I'll check it out. At first, I thought it was good for all ages, but there are some jokes regarding sex. Not that explicit though. I believe it'll only get better going forward and flourish like ABC's 'Young & Hungry'. It is just a two season young programme and I would surely suggest for those who are interested in comedy to start now to keep up with its original pace.

**_SEASON 01:_**

Yeah, I'm from the walkman era. The cassettes, tape recorder, I've lived in the final days of that time enjoying all of them. I still have some old tapes saved somewhere that I've to locate them, but I've no device to place them. Anyway, when I heard about this series, how those previous technology was used to narrate a thriller drama, I was so happy. Each episode named after the how many tapes used, and its sides. Maybe the new generation won't understand that. Though the story matters, what it was focused and unfolding the truth, the message was great.

One of the top rated debut from the 2017. The Netflix usually strikes the gold, and so with this. After so many good reviews, I wanted to see it to learn what's that all about. In the end, I did not get disappointed. But it was not that great, except the message, a very important message in the present world. I thought they dragged it. The whole season. I think it should have been only half of those total episodes. So the plots would have got tighter and faster narration. That suicide scene really terrified me. It was too strong, definitely I'm against showing that to youngsters.

It was about a boy who receive a box of tapes from the dead girl. The girl who committed suicide, so she has recorded these tapes telling what made her to take this terrible decision. All those influenced in her life to her death gets the tape and finally how it all ends is the mystery told in the final episode. But before that, how the tale develops among the guys who are involved in it decides to stop this attempt. It's not that easily stopped and reasons are revealed.

Initially I thought it was one season thing, but now after the final episode, I think definitely season two is on. They have announced it as well now. Well acted and made with the production. Many actors you can point out, but Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford topped the list. There's more to come or I'm expected in the following season than what this season has revealed. So I think I'm going like that more than this. It's too early, but there's a very little it to get wrong. I hope that's where it ends, but they could be tempted to extend the series. Anyway, a nice watch. It will remain one of the best from the streaming giant! So watch it sooner than later!

_7.5/10_ | 13 Reasons Why does indeed make suicide seem glamorous. It's a dangerous message. Hannah Baker made a lot of bad choices throughout the series. She was attracted to dangerous, selfish boys, she dismissed the nice ones, and failed to help her friend as she was being violated just a few feet away in the same room. She drank herself silly, put importance in stupid, shallow things and then decided the best place to strip down to her bra and panties was in the hot tub of the very same boy who she just watched rape her friend. As she is taking it deep in her sniz from behind, is she really surprised? Of course, there is never an excuse to rape. However, a female must be aware of risky situations. If you are prone to getting black-out drunk or stoned or you commonly end up nude or semi-nude in rapists' hot tubs, your odds of being taken advantage of go up exponentially.

Season 2 is even more maddening than the 1st. Why? Because it goes out of its way to paint all females as natural born victims who are at the mercy of evil boys and men... ALL THE TIME.  Nothing is a girl's fault. Ever. As if that message isn't bad enough, Hannah gets to take a break from Heaven so she can return to Earth as a ghost and see how completely devastated people are without her. This will inevitably inspire real suicides of narcissistic dummies who feel the world revolves around them and their stupid romance problems. What many dolts don't realize is that when you are dead, YOU ARE DEAD. You don't get to watch everybody melt down because your awesome self is gone. It's over. FOREVER.

In conclusion, ultimately, NOBODY cares about who you are crushing on or who is manipulating your genitalia. Why not do your homework and take some time off from being an annoying idiot? Give it a try! Maybe you can contribute something positive to society rather than polluting the Universe with a bunch of melodramatic BS. | The rollercoaster that started with Hannah Baker and her titular motivations that drove her to suicide has finally come to a full stop. Everyone involved in the infamous tapes are damaged beyond repair, regardless what happinesses they find, and no one more than our protagonist Clay Jensen, whose conflict takes on the most phantasmagorical in the final ten episodes.

For a show that's gone on as long as **_13 Reasons Why_** (and, let's be real, it really didn't need to surpass one season), the melodrama keeps piling on. The first season is not without its faults but it's superior to everything that follows. Season 2 was one long, dragged out snoozer that hit no bumps until the finale, which brought us what is singlehandedly the most uncomfortable scene in the entire series (perhaps even Netflix overall). Yes, even more than the (now removed) bathtub suicide at the end of season 1.

While season 3 was a marked improvement over 2, ignoring the question of ""why the hell is this still on?"", at least new character Ani came in with something resembling a backstory, because that can't be said for any other new characters, although her use becomes extremely problematic (I'll give you a hint, it involves redeeming a rapist). A number of supporting players come into play in the second and third seasons, and then vanish with next to no explanation.

The writers room seem to have little idea how contemporary teenagers act, peppering every other word with an F bomb and their lives is one giant soap opera. This may be how some Gen Z'ers see their existence but **_13RW_** is next level. Bullying that leads to suicide is all too unfortunately common, yet has anyone (prior to the show's release) actually gone out of their way to record who they blame for the ultimate decision?

One thing I will credit the series as a whole is the committed performances of its young actors (_young_ is a strong word, considering the actor behind sociopathic school bully Montgomery is in his early thirties). With the material they're given, Katherine Langford (Hannah), Miles Heizer (Alex), Alisha Boe (Jessica), Brandon Flynn (Justin), Timothy Granaderos (Monty)--especially come season 4--really play out their strengths. But the most notable performance has to go to Devin Druid as the ambiguously disordered yearbook photographer Tyler.

Tyler's journey is, without a doubt, the most harrowing and heartbreaking arc, because he may as well be one of the realest depictions of a teenager--regardless of generation--on TV. He's a nice enough kid but he's singled out by everyone around him as weird and--in the case of the aforementioned tapes--seen as one of the worst subjects (his offense being a stalker), despite said tapes including a serial rapist, a pathological liar, a cowardly educator, a backstabbing friend and a slut-shamer.

The character development award goes to Brandon Flynn, who brings Justin Foley, a troubled boy from a broken and abusive home life, to life. The book that the series is based on doesn't go into that much detail but Flynn's downtrodden demeanor plays perfect to Justin's addiction storyline. He goes from gaslighting his girlfriend about being raped and solving problems with vague threats of violence to someone the audience really roots for, a protective and caring adopted brother to Clay. That is, until his life on the streets catches up to him and he's revealed to have contracted AIDS somewhere down the line. This is given a passing comment somewhere mid-season 4 and brought up in the extended length series finale.

Not sure who to pin that on, I guess the showrunners wanted to go out on something big. And nothing says big like offing a major and well-developed character (who's played by a gay man) with outdated representations of a controversially depicted disease in the final 90 minutes of your show.

Season 1: 86% | Season 2: 22% | Season 3: 42% | Season 4: 36% | Average: 46.5% | So, what we have here is a game of blame. A blame game that pushes the responsibility for a suicide from the individual to everyone else, almost saying that the decision to off oneself is made by others.

And then, as if to draw the biggest difference between Millennials and everyone else, it almost goes out of its way to say that people don't base their views on what everyone else thinks are wrong for being independently minded.

The message is clear, let others think for you unto your death. | **Short Summery: TV show started good, but turned into crap woke political show.**

1. Season is okay
2. Season is better
3. Season is bad and started showing signs of woke propaganda
4. Season is worst and is a pure propaganda

**_Before you continue reading, be aware my review will contain spoilers._**

I watched first season and this is the conclusion I made from these series: Hannah Baker (girl who killed herself) was a drama queen who made a lot of mistakes, weren't very bright in her head and instead of making things right, she decided to end her own life and blame others. She was definitely a stupid girl. Who doesn't get bullied in school? I got bullied too when I was a kid. I'm pretty sure lots of you got bullied too, but it doesn't mean you need to kill yourself. You move on and concentrate on more important things like your future and study instead of those moron teenagers. From everything that I saw in a first season I saw crime only twice: Raping and sexual harrasment. Hannah saw how her classmate got raped by other classmate. She got harrased several times sexually by the same person and another person (Marcus, in a restaurant), yet instead of telling parents and going to Police station, she kept it quite. But what's most stupid thing she did was going at night to the rapist's house party & getting half naked in his hot tub which apparently she ended up being raped by him. Seriously, what did you expect? You know that, this guy is a rapist, yet you go to his house party at night, get in his hot tub half naked and end up with him alone in the tub? How dumb you must be to do that? But her stupidity doesn't end up there. After she gets raped by that guy, instead of finally going to Police station, again she keeps it as a secret and acts like nothing happens. Later she visits school council and tries to tell him about it, but she doesn't. She just gives him some puzzled answers when council is asking the right questions. Eventually he tells her that ""either you speak up about it and we will try to help, either you move on"", because if victim doesn't speak out about it, then no one can help them. It's the only way. And as always, Hannah fails here too and refuses to admit what happened and instead decides to kill herself and then records audio cassettes where she blames a lots of kids for her suicide, even good kids that didn't deserve it. For example, Ryan publishes her poem without her consent because he thinks whatever she wrote was beautiful (it's clear his intentions are good), yet Hannah gets upset and puts his name on the list of her bullies. Yeah, these kids are teenagers, they're not perfect, they will make mistakes, it's normal. All in all, I think Hannah was just a suicidal girl who would still kill herself soon or later in her life because she was too much sensitive snowflake + dumb and usually those two things don't mix well. If not this school, I'm pretty sure somewhere something else would still provoke her to end her life, maybe her coworker would say something mean or etc... Bottom line is that: Life's not perfect. Teenagers aren't perfect. Kids can be mean and bullies, but you move on and if you encounter any serious crime like rape, you go to Police station and speak about it! Things that Hannah didn't do. In general, she was a stupid girl who made lots of mistakes.

Second season is better. Not much to say about it, but it's more interesting.

Third season is already showing signs of propaganda. Jessica turns into some feminist crazy person. It's also dragging and slow and they put this new character Ani - African girl as a main character to narrate. Her character is so shallow, boring and uninteresting. She's horrible. Everything about her is annoying, her voice, her personality, her lies, EVERYTHING. She came out of left field, doesn't even fit with the original characters. And her stupid accent doesn't help either. She feels like creators of show just decided to take her and put her in this show because of her stupid accent. She feels like she doesn't belong in this show. God, she's so boring and annoying... Every time I hear her accent I want to turn off this show. Ending is also crap. Alex kills Bryce. Cold-hearted feminist Jessica doesn't help and they let Bryce drown and this stupid African guild covers them and blames on Monty.

Fourth season is worst of all seasons. It's a pure LGBT propaganda! I counted and 12 characters turns out gays! I think it's too much and not even realistic at all. This season is just a pure political agenda. Libtards are pushing it hard here, even making prom king and queen two king gay couples who everyone applaudes even their own parents. And Jessica character still being crappy feminist woke shit. It feels like that some libtard feminist LGBT American teenager wrote this garbage shit. It's a pure crap. I'm giving it 3/10, because story's not that bad, but this woke shit propaganda ruins the show. Lastly, thankfully, we don't have that annoying UK accent girl narrating the story.

Saddest thing is that US used to make best shows and movies in the past, like in 90's and early 2000, but all they make nowadays is a pure garbage propaganda. This country turned into some politically propaganda country with lowest quality for movies and shows.

They did a decent job adapting the original show, but I hope that in season 2, they make it a bit more aligned with the original, not a recreation, but a little more aligned with the original. That would be amazing. | **Who are the writer??**

Those who grew up with the memories of the original animation series, here is a bad news  for you. This live action is an absolute abomination!

It had a promising start, and the first 3 episodes were enjoyable. Eventually, the new writers’ plague took over and turned everything into a mess. They literally changed the original story and  made it to deliver “the message”! The last 3 episodes were so bad, I wanted them to end it already. I am not going to go into details, but here are the good and bad from my perspective:

GOOD:
1. I liked the casting. The actors look like the original animation series characters.
2. Zuko is a good actor. His uncle on the other hand seems goofy.
3.Some good CGI.

BAD:
1. Bad acting, direction, dialogues.
2. No character building or chemistry between characters.
3. The storyline is changed dramatically, which looks like any other Netflix girl boss series. E.g. God forbid if water bending women had to take the nurturing and healing role. They must fight into the battle and stand up against the patriarchy. Katara beating Zuko’s ass, Azula is the ultimate warrior, and so on. These days you simply can’t entertain yourself without being lectured about something. 🤦🏻‍♂️

Overall, extremely bad remake (if you want to call it one). I would rather watch the animation series again than waste my time on this crap.

4/10. | A live action movie cannot create 1:1 replication of each small moments of the animated series. Nevertheless a good try. | Truly an attempt. but beating the look of the worst movie of all time isn't a big achievement. The appearance and action of this show is nearly perfect, but the writing and plot leave so much to be desired that I can't help but wonder why anyone would watch this instead of the perfection of the original cartoon. It's almost hard to sit through knowing how each impactful scene will be mangled by the exposition machines (sorry, characters). Aang freaking out about Monk Gyatso makes no sense if he already knows all the airbenders are dead and when learning that info, barely reacted. Katara doesn't even calm him down, he just has flashbacks of Monk Gyatso and stuff until he feels better. 0/10 writing, visuals get a 5/10 for managing to at least resemble the original show, but the original bending animations are such masterpieces that it still outshines this show. And they forgot to try with the script, so it's literally just having the plot spoken aloud most of the time instead of ever seeing any of it. no impact. | Why remake perfection? The original show was perfect and has aged well, just make a different story in the same universe and step out of Aang's shadow. They spend most of the show telling us what happens instead of just remaking the beautiful scenes from the original show, so distasteful. | Never seen original show (as I understand this is a remake) and never seen cartoon, but I started watching this on Netflix and I can say only good things about this show. No woke propaganda, no BS and it's very enjoyable to watch it. Watched first season already and I love it.

In short, cringe-worthy, woke, overdoses on schmaltz to the point of nausea....a lame story doesn't help, either, nor does the strange, contextually confusing, casting choices....

Special effects are reasonable, sets decent and the music is appropriate but beyond that....???

I managed to watch the  first episode and that was more than enough.....  | Genuinely great video game adaption that manages to walk the narrow path of capturing the feel of the games (the dark humor), while telling a brand new story that works as a television show and expanding that existing universe.

Walton Goggins is perfectly cast as the worldly ghoul, he is really the star of the show.  The other two protagonists are well cast as naives sent out in to the wild, untamed wasteland with the best of intentions balancing out the anti-hero ghoul.

There's the over-the-top violence of the games, and the weirdness is here too. It captures the heart that the later games tried to bring (it lands better here), with the characters who have complex, interesting (and often secret) motivations.

The key themes include the power and greed of corporations (thanks Amazon!), the inevitability of conflict and the dangers of living in a ideological bubble. (The later point obviously lost on the other reviewer here.) That said this isn't aiming to be Oppenheimer.

Most of all this show is simply great fun, highly recommended if you are a fan of the game or never played it. | Having played New Vegas and Fallout 4, I'm a huge fan of the Fallout world, so the best thing I  could say about this show is that it is Fallout in appearance, tone,  and lore. The story is dark, quirky and humorous, taking many twists and turns appropriate to it's source material...basically everything you'd want in any video game adaptation. I loved this season from beginning to the end, and will watch again and continue to watch future seasons (which is guaranteed at this point due to its critical success and that they've just secured 25 million from the California government to make the next season in the state) just as I've played the games over and over again (and will do so until Bethesda releases a new Fallout game). | Woke this, woke that.

**_Fallout_** might just be the greatest sci-fi horror video game adaptation ever made. From the sets to the scores to the scenery and style, there's a clear love for the source material here that shines through the grisly surface. Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, and Walton Goggins were a perfect trifecta of leads, and each hold their own weight accordingly, and the combination of their stories is flawless enough to complement an already excellent roster of visual and auditory delights.

Top-tier action-apocalypse media that should satisfy fans and newcomers alike, so long as you aren't in it for the wrong reasons. This fits into the franchise as much as any other entry as a standalone series, and has an attention to detail and epic scale, big budget, and high energy that not many works can seem to capture when they go to screen in today's industry. I, for one, am glad this exists. Totally delivered every bit of retro-futuristic dystopian survival drama I needed. | **Extremely Bad**

I was recommended by a friend to watch this as a ""must-watch,"" and boy, I fell for his prank.

Eight episodes of lengthy, boring, disjointed torture, which leads nowhere.

I have never played the game or read the lore; therefore, I am not an OG fan. My view is purely based on these eight episodes of mess.

Where to begin? Well, the first episode was boring, but I stayed with the hope that something nice would happen. I wasn’t wrong, as episodes 2 and 3 were really good. They started introducing new characters and developed their personalities. Unfortunately, after that, the writers' and directors' weaknesses started showing up as the story feels really illogical and disjointed.

Bad acting, unnecessary and illogical fights. Need not to mention, I hate this new Hollywood trend (especially Marvel) where they play 1960s music and show fight scenes in slow motion. You can like it for once or twice, but this crap has been shoved down the throat in every movie these days. This series was nauseatingly full of such scenes.

The storyline is so weak, no one knows why people are doing something? The Garfield-eyed protagonist is very annoying and stupid. She is supposed to be looking for her father, but meanwhile, she seems bubbly and cheerful, literally asking someone to have sex with her, unnecessarily spying on a vault people… why???

As if this was not enough, the series gets worse from episode 4 onwards. But this time all the nuts and bolts of this stupid series start coming off, and no one knows what’s happening. They tried to show unnecessary gore, violence, and disgust to give “shock treatment” to their viewers and get some attention, but after some time, even that feels annoying and boring.

I give it 3/10.

P.S. My friend is not responding to my texts. He knows what he did. He is so done! | I absolutely loved this, I was expecting it to be good but not this good probably one of the best adaptations of a game to series I’ve ever seen. It has gore, comedy and other hints from the fallout franchise as well as a great soundtrack. I can’t wait for season 2 to arrive. | Fallout is definitely worth a view it’s amazing as well as clever. Some people complain about it being woke which isn’t the case, this isn’t Netflix. Can’t wait for season 2! | What a cool show! I really enjoyed this. From start to finish, the vibe and mix of humour and despair was a lot of fun. I remember playing the games years and years ago, and from what I can remember they nailed the world. It feels (almost) exactly how I remember it.

The production value is superb and the writing and acting were all top notch. Amazon has been building quite the track record recently with some of these higher profile shows. All I can say is, I can't wait for season 2. | I absolutely loved it. To see Fallout in this way was breathtaking, with us seeing post war and pre war Los Angeles as well as a new vault, was already a massive expansion to the Fallout universe. Along with the new characters and the brilliant sound track with our favourite Fallout songs it’s really a dream come true for Fallout fans. 

I also feel this is a perfect way for people to be introduced to the Fallout universe which seems to be the case as a flood of new and returning fans have come back to the world of Fallout. | I think this is a good series. It’s a mix of humor, special effects, and a great story. I believe Walton Goggins gives an excellent performance in this series.

After watching so many underwhelming projects from the Scooby-Doo franchise lately, seeing something that not only pays a loving tribute to the original ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" series, but also expanding and improving upon elements in new and interesting ways that doesn't feel wrong and out of place is so mind boggling to me.

Like i knew going in that this was going to a joy to watch, but my first impression of the first few episodes was't too high. I like the idea of Shaggy and Velma dating at the beginning only for them to break up because they have so little in common, that it would ultimately be a very unhealthy relationship, but i feel like them dragging that plot point out for the first 10 episodes felt a bit tedious. Shaggy and Velma want it to work out, but you know it's not gonna last and I feel like they should ended their relationship in the first 5 episodes.  This is when Scooby becomes really unlikable for these first few episodes where he hates the idea of sharing Shaggy with Velma even though later in the series, Scooby gets his own girlfriend and Shaggy doesn't mind at all. So the show runners just made him unlikable for the sole reason of splitting up Shaggy and Velma. Daphne's dialogue 95% of the time just boiled down to ""Will Fred F^$% me?"" and she barely has any personality out of that, but thankfully she get's better later in the series and it is really sweet when Fred and Daphne finally get together. Fred  was perfectly fine for a bit, he's admiration for traps is cranked up to 11 and it is very funny if you want to think about in anime logic. I heard somewhere that the best character in Scooby-Doo history was Mystery Incorporated's iteration of Fred and for most of the first season, I didn't see it. But when we get to Fred's parents, it get's really interesting. So it turns out that apparently Fred's mom that he thought died was just a photo from a magazine and the person that he saw as his father his whole life stole him when Fred was a baby from his real parents which is such a betrayal because we got to grow attached to these characters for the entire duration of season 1. But what's most heartbreaking is that even though the mayor practically treated Fred like dirt and Fred always trying to get his dad's approval, he was more of a loving and compassionate father than his supposed ""real"" parents. 

The overall mystery was really well done and cool, but this is where I get to one of my other problems, the mysteries are some of the predictable they have ever been in Scooby-Doo history. I learned overtime that there is a trade-off with Scooby-Doo mysteries. Either A, a mystery has around 5 suspects,but ultimately feels overbloated with undeveloped characters that the episodes has to divide it's time with or B, a mystery has about 2 suspects, but usually one is just too obvious to be the suspect and that's where the predictability comes in. Option B is does give an episode a tighter script, but it  doesn't lead to a strong mystery. 

The side characters were honestly pretty good. Patrick Warburton as Sheriff Stone was really enjoyable and the sexual tension between him and Mayor Jones was on another on another level, but no, they had to give him a girlfriend in the form as the OTHER mayor which is sad because my fan-fiction will never come to light now :(. uh, I don't know if this is a hot take or not, but I didn't like Hot Dog Water very much as a character. I really can't take her seriously with her name and design and she's just really a discount version of Velma and I didn't see her and Velma as a romantic pairing, like at all, but her ultimate sacrifice was well done and a good send-off for her as a character. Mr E and Professor Pericles was both great villains and very intimating and some of the best Scooby-Doo has to offer. The Vincent Young tribute character was funny, I wish they actually gave Skipper Shelton some focus in a episode, Gary and Ethan for pretty much chads, the parents were (mostly) a delight, and The Hex Girls cameo appearances are at least better than the one in Legend of the Vampire.

Another problem I have with this show is it's commentary. It was alright in the first episode, but I guess the writers completely don't know what the meaning of ""subtle"" is.  It's so on the nose and frequent that it starts to just become annoying and preachy. Like I came to watch a Scooby-Doo cartoon, not a critique on the American Legal System. The only way I see that actually working and being effective if it way more restrained and a lot more subtle.

Overall great show, it still has it's problems no doubt, but the amount of good things in it just makes it, for me, the Scooby-Doo media ever made and I will take that to my grave if I must.

Primal seeks out to nullify that, and it all needed to do was to go back to their roots, quite literally even, and tell a narrative of how a man, aptly named Spear, and his rival-first/semi-pet friend-later Tyrannosaurus Rex, also aptly named Fang, setting up their character without a coherent piece of exchange of dialogue between the two, unless you count constant gruntling, using their instincts to work together, overcoming challenges and it's beautiful. </b></i>

Primal is a visual masterclass on how ""show and tell"" is a more of a ingenious tactic from the creators of the forefather, primitive for the creation of Adult Swim later on, Gendy, besides his art-work, was creatively bounded by the suitable watchers of young children and early teens but always managed to pull of the darker strings in PowerPuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory, and unfortunately almost capped that off with the almost brilliant it set out to be in Sym-bionic Titan in his later parts of his career. Nevertheless, greenlighted to make a mature version of Samurai Jack, which by all-means is an all timer in it's own right, Gendy's true vision in storytelling unlocks at the helms of his latest project in Primal. While being creative in his designs, it's always a tougher challenge to make your art speak volumes, and ironically enough, the lack of dialogues amplifies how it achieves that, while concomitantly builds the tension it's rooted itself in the setting he chose. While yes, the ""focus-on-character, shock-face, reveal-dilemma"" might get a bit jaded and repetitive for the amounts of time they limit themselves, it does however create for a violent contention of World Building, which I believe would never be suitably built elsewhere except in the realm of Primal, that episode in, episode out has been subjected with consistent writing. Primarily built on 2 characters, there's always a case of how stagnant the show can get, with only a singular filler in a span of 20 episodes separating them, the layers on either of them hinders from them being just that and probably why the ""anthology-aspect and feel"" of the show helps that as well while being in the major compound focus of the theme, i-e, Survival. All in all, a sublime watch for gore fans, history fans and people who are looking for animated recommendations.

Back slapping jokery characterisations are the norm. Airmen who are at the same time overconfident but somehow, inexplicably wise. Its unconvincing, as is the general sense of longing, for a rose coloured vision of a war time past, that never existed. 

Growing up I knew a man who fought in WWII and for a time had the unfortunate job of cleaning the bombers after a mission. What he told me about what was left in a plane after a bad mission was simply horrific. In fact, a lot worse than what we see depicted here. Although, in fairness, this series does at least make an effort to demonstrate, to a degree, the awfulness of war. 

That said, this series feels in most respects, more like a pitch for glory rather than the grisly, depressing reality of conflict and I, for one, find it rather inappropriate. Especially given the spread of very serious conflicts, in the world today.

On the upside the acting is of a high standard, if somewhat hamstrung by the at times cheesy, cliched characterisations and associated narrative. 

The real stand out in this series goes to its special effects, which can only be described as ""amazing"". A heck of a lot of money has been spent here and it really shows. 

In summary, if the treatment had been more down to earth, realistic and steered away from glorifying war, this series could have been been a more meaningful and compelling watch. As it stands, to this reviewer, it comes across as yet another pro military poster child. Something the current war torn world, could well do without. | Was really hoping for a factually accurate representation of Air Combat in WW2, but what I was presented with (and in fairness I'm only 2 episodes in, so it might improve) is a massive bunch of revisionist, pro-American, anti-English/British nonsense that spends more time portraying squadrons, for want of a better word, ""fannying around"" than actually flying.

The performance of most of the actors is terrible, especially the two main characters. Austin Butler seems to have forgotten he's not playing Elvis anymore and has the same mannerisms and woeful underacting. This is only beaten by Callum Turner's hideous overacting. The only one that puts in a semi-noteworthy performance is Barry Keoghan. 

The plot then spends precisely zero time building the main characters up during training like Band of Brothers, or even their pre-military lives. As a result, I just have no emotional investment in any of them. I don't care about them. 

Also, the writers have fallen into the trap of creating the main characters like they seem to with a lot of modern characters. That is, they've been written to be overly cool, confident, super accomplished, ""Mary Sue's"" that can do no wrong and win at everything they do. The writers have created people that they _think_ the audience wants to see, but that just then makes them totally unrelatable. An example of this is where a fight starts in a pub with the British. The British pilot starts it, of course. The American pilots who, until this point, are portrayed as being overly confident, brash, and trying too hard to be cool, immediately switch personalites with the British who, until this point portrayed as, reserved, timid, and just in awe of the Americans in general. All of a sudden, the Americans become the ones that want to just mind their own business, are reserved and cool; while the portrayal of the RAF pilots are obnoxious, pompous, arrogant, and abrasive. Naturally, the American pilot utterly humiliates the British pilot by dancing all round him, making him fall over. The result is that the main characters are just thoroughly unlikeable and boring that you have absolutely no emotional investment in them. The absolute opposite of Dick Winters et al from the peerless Band of Brothers. 

It also leaves a bitter taste in the mouth as the British are portrayed as bigger villains that actual enemy is. 

Furthermore, the justification given for American bombing happening during the day was because they wanted to be more accurate at the expense of more risk - a challenge all the pilots faced with swagger, arrogance, and bravado, and because they are so much braver and heroic than the RAF wimps who just carpet bomb cities without a care in the world. 

But back to reality, this was predominantly down to overconfidence and hubris of the US leadership and because they refused to learn lessons identified by the RAF and Luftwaffe and that bombing during the day was counterproductive. Sure, you may be able to hit the target more on the first run, but by the end of it, you had so few bombers and crew left you couldn't reliably hit anything. The more bombers you lost, the more you were likely to lose, which then meant the less likely you were to complete a run at all, never mind bomb the target. 

This was proved correct when, on 22nd October 1943, the 8th Army stopped bombing it's unescorted daylight raids because they finally realised it was unsustainable. During this time, the USAAF, working with RAF Bomber Command, tried switching to night bombing, but found that the B-17s simply weren't capable and the crews not skilled enough to bomb with any amount of relevant precision. The ONLY reason day bombing could continue was due to the British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine being placed in the P51, along with the advent of drop tanks, meaning the P51 could escort bombers all the way to the target and back again.

Not only this, but the much vaunted (and boasted about in the show), Norden Bombsight, was nowhere near as accurate as it is believed. Under test conditions, it was great. Under combat conditions where aircraft had to zig zag to evade being hit by flak and flying over poor European weather conditions, meant that it was barely more accurate than the RAF's night bombing anyway! What this resulted in was many completely avoidable American deaths, but I bet they won't say that during this series. 

The best I can say is that the visuals are OK, but even they have been CGId to the extreme.

The missions themselves are boring and generally last 10 minutes, 15 minutes at the absolute most. Likely due to the fact that CGI has been used so heavily and the show couldn't afford more.

Sadly, what we've got here is a total misrepresentation of actual history, portrayed by a bunch of unlikeable characters simultaneously embodying the worst stereotypes of American soldiers and ""modern"" character development by writers that seem to have completely lost the ability to create a likeable character. They do all this in an overly CGId world, where most of the time the characters aren't doing anything remotely interesting or important and the 'combat' scenes last a grand total of 15 minutes. It's dull as dishwater and I'm sad that it's even been broadcast.","Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle, Nate Mann, Stephen Campbell Moore",0.0,False,0.0,2024.0

Recommended! | ""If you can tell a taut, precise story in one episode, stretch it out into a slack, incoherent, tedious season instead"" seems to be this show's motto. House of Cards has good ideas and good actors, which it fails in its execution, with poor scripts and poorer editing. The story could have easily been told in half the time, and would have been all the better for it. This TV series is, like so much in the original Netflix stable, cattle feed for its undiscerning subscribers. | Seasons 1 and 2 are a 9.7/10.
Seasons 3,4 and 5 are around an 8/10.
And season 6 was a 6.3/10, unlike most people I didn't hate the last season even tho the ending was pretty underwelming. The show is an 8/10. | Wow! I have never stopped watching a series before this one. Even some of the paltry tripe like ""Dante's Cove"" or ""Game Of Thrones"" I managed to watch the series. But I watched the first season of this into Episode 10, where Frank kills Peter, and I just. Couldn't. Stand it. I ejected the blu-ray and have put up the series on Ebay for sale. I'll let someone else suffer.

NO ONE IS THIS MORALLY BANKRUPT AND EVIL (except for maybe Donald Trump). While we all would like to think that the deep, dark heart of politics is based on behaviour such as this, it is not reasonable that two people (Frank and Claire) would be able to manipulate EVERYBODY in their sphere to get what they want. Yes, there are naive people out there, but not everyone is cut from that cloth. This series (or at least what I could take of it) tries to make us believe that they are all cut from the same cloth, except for Frank and Claire. Stupid, just stupid.

To the creators of this show and to Netflix - you have to give the viewer a reason to watch this series, other than to dread every next move that the main characters make. There was no evidence at all that Frank and Claire were anything more than conniving, hateful people, because the writing and, especially, the direction gave us no more than that. And when the main characters are like that (written and directed very one-dimensionally), it makes it unwatchable because I, as the viewer, have no hope for any character in the show to develop in a positive manner or to react realistically to situations presented. Instead of killing Russo, Underwood could have been a human being and helped him into rehab, which would have effectively muzzled him anyway. But no - for dramatic effect, they had to have him killed. To what end? It made me as the viewer cringe and realize that the show was going to continue this way going forward, with no redemption for anyone in the show.

That being said, the performances were absolutely amazing, given the crappy material and direction that they were given. But good acting only goes so far. It *almost* seemed like Claire wanted to bust out when she was off coupling with her soulmate, but he turned out not to be that, as she suddenly reverted back to her mean and heartless ways.

I watch series for character development and to learn about human behaviour. I need a *hero* or at least a main character that has hope for growth and/or redemption. This series has neither. (Very much like Dexter years ago - why would I cheer or want to follow a serial killer?)

**Verdict:** _Great_ | Alright, Marvel fans, grab your bows because _Hawkeye_ on Disney+ is ready to serve up holiday vibes, action, and some seriously entertaining chemistry between Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld. If you’re expecting this show to blow open the multiverse or drop some mind-bending revelations, pump the brakes—this one’s a little different. It’s lighter, it’s fun, and it’s got just enough holiday spirit to keep you cozy during the season.

Clint Barton, the everyman Avenger, is just trying to make it home to his family for Christmas. Seems simple enough, but throw in Kate Bishop—a 22-year-old archer with hero aspirations—and things get complicated fast. She stumbles into trouble with the _Tracksuit Mafia_, a stolen Rolex, and Clint’s old Ronin suit, dragging him back into a world he thought he left behind. What follows is a buddy-cop style adventure through New York City with trick arrows, witty banter, and a surprising amount of heart.

When it comes to performances, Jeremy Renner effortlessly embodies Clint’s no-nonsense, world-weary demeanor. He’s been through the wringer, and you feel that weight in his portrayal. Hailee Steinfeld, on the other hand, shines as Kate Bishop. She brings a mix of charm, determination, and comedic timing that makes her instantly likable. Together, Renner and Steinfeld’s chemistry is the backbone of the show, keeping things engaging even when the plot feels scattered.

_Hawkeye_ doesn’t try to compete with the cosmic stakes of _Loki_ or the surreal mind games of _WandaVision_, and that’s part of its appeal. It’s more grounded, with a focus on character development and personal stakes rather than saving the universe. Clint’s internal struggle with his past as Ronin adds depth to his character, giving him a more human side that hasn’t been fully explored before.

While the show keeps the action tight and fun, it’s the guest appearances that really spice things up. Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova makes an electrifying return, Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez adds a fierce new layer to the story, and Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin? A welcome surprise that raises the stakes in the final episodes. However, at times the show struggles to give all its characters enough room to breathe, and the pacing can feel a bit uneven.

But _Hawkeye_ knows how to hit those feel-good holiday notes, wrapping up its action with humor and warmth. Whether it’s Clint teaching Kate some trick arrow tricks or the hilarious rooftop fight with Christmas lights and Molotov cocktails, the show doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s the kind of fun, feel-good superhero content that fits perfectly with the holiday season.

In the end, _Hawkeye_ doesn’t aim to redefine the MCU, but it delivers exactly what it should—a fun, character-driven adventure with plenty of festive spirit. Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld are a winning duo, and with action, humor, and some heartwarming moments, this is a holiday treat worth unwrapping.

""The Falcon and The Winter Soldier is definitely a less enthusiastic, slower, more grounded series than its magical predecessor, but it accomplishes the main mission of bringing the audience closer to Sam and Bucky. The character-driven show features exceptional dialogues and terrific performances from its leads, but the supporting cast steals the spotlight on several occasions, especially Daniel Brühl. The ""Black Captain America"" narrative and the subplot involving John Walker and a deep exploration of Cap's mantle are undoubtedly the most compelling, well-developed arcs of the whole series, though I appreciated every second spent with Sam dealing with his family issues and Bucky with his amends. However, the Morgenthau-led Flag Smashers fail to become more than just misunderstood, annoying antagonists, while Sharon Carter just feels like a completely out-of-place, unnecessary marketing strategy. Kari Skogland tries to keep every episode at a high level of quality, ultimately struggling with pacing issues and balance of storylines. In the end, she succeeds in leaving the viewers more emotionally attached to the (new) main heroes.""

Rating: B- | The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was an enjoyable show to watch for the most part, but there are some glaring weaknesses. From a main hero that sympathizes with the villain over and over again, to an antagonist group that is not fleshed out and seems half baked. This show has some incredible shots and story arches with the new Captain America's downfall under the pressure of the world and the rise of The Falcon.

**Verdict:** _Decent_ | Anthony Mackie is brilliant bringing his character Falcon full circle to realize he was destined to be Captain America. Bucky Barnes is one of the best character redemption arcs in a comic book movie ever and Sebastian Stan was so freaking awesome. Throw in some Demo whom I need so much more of but know I sadly will not get, some of the Wakanda warriors, and a shocking twist on a good character going bad-ish and this show is exactly what Marvel fans ask for. It closes some loose ends but opens the way for so much more to come. | _The Falcon and The Winter Soldier_ hits different. It’s gritty, it’s raw, and honestly, it gets closer to the edge of what we’ve been craving from Marvel—a deeper dive into what it _really_ means to be a hero. This isn’t just Sam and Bucky throwing punches and cracking jokes, though there’s plenty of that. It’s about the weight of the shield, the burden of legacy, and who truly deserves to carry the mantle of Captain America.

Let’s start with the obvious—Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are magic together. Their chemistry isn’t just solid, it’s _the_ foundation of this show. Whether they’re snarking at each other or working through their trauma, they bring so much heart and depth to their roles. It’s their dynamic that keeps the story grounded even when the action kicks into high gear. Seriously, without their banter and emotional beats, this show wouldn’t hit the same way.

And speaking of action, once this show finds its footing, it _soars_. Yes, it starts off a little slow, but once we’re knee-deep in the espionage and global stakes, it’s game on. We’re talking full-blown action sequences that rival the movies. But what I love is that it doesn’t just rely on spectacle. The fight scenes matter because of what’s going on beneath the surface—moral gray areas, power dynamics, and the pressure that comes with being more than just a man behind a shield.

What really makes _The Falcon and The Winter Soldier_ stand out is how it tackles some seriously tough issues. This isn’t just a superhero show; it’s a story about race, identity, and what it means to be a symbol in America. The way they explore Sam’s hesitation to take on the Captain America title is _bold_. Isaiah Bradley’s backstory? Heartbreaking and brutal, but so important. These moments make you pause and reflect, which is rare for a Marvel property, but man, it’s powerful.

Now, we have to talk about John Walker. Wyatt Russell as the new Captain America? Oof. The guy just exudes discomfort and frustration, and that’s the point. He’s not Steve Rogers, and the show makes sure you feel that tension. Walker’s descent, especially after that brutal shield moment, is intense, and it raises a lot of uncomfortable questions about power and morality.

This series digs deep into the consequences of being a hero, but it doesn’t lose sight of the fun. It’s still packed with those moments that make you cheer, laugh, or get a little choked up (yeah, I said it). It’s got heart and humor, and that classic Marvel spirit is still there—just with a lot more grit and real-world weight.

Sure, the pacing’s not perfect, but when the pieces come together, it’s worth the wait. And let’s not forget that this is setting up _so much more_. The Power Broker reveal, the global implications of super-soldiers, and, of course, Sam officially taking up the shield—it’s all priming us for the next phase of the MCU.

Bottom line: _The Falcon and The Winter Soldier_ doesn’t play it safe. It’s got layers, it’s got heart, and it’s not afraid to tackle the tough stuff. And by the time Sam steps into the Captain America suit? You’re all in. This is Marvel storytelling at its finest, and if you’re not onboard yet, you’re missing out.","Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Erin Kellyman, Daniel Brühl",0.0,False,0.0,2021.0

It was syndicated all over the country by then, and locally it aired on Sunday nights at 6pm (a fairly wise strategy, since airing episodes once a week meant they wouldn't run through them too quickly).

My father was a fan of the show, and we watched it together every Sunday evening after dinner. When we started this ritual I was too young to enjoy most of the shows my dad enjoyed, but this had everything I could want; good guys, bad guys, lots of action, inventive plots, gadgets, and humor.  

It might be the only show that I enjoyed at that age that I still enjoy today because of its quality. (I can still watch Happy Days or the Dukes of Hazzard and remember WHY I enjoyed them at that age, but they don't hold up).

The writers were inventive, and the show was able to mix sci-fi with the western genre very well, with some really nice gothic horror touches and mystery elements along the way. 

Robert Conrad deserves praise for his stunt work, which was a hallmark of the show, along with Ross Martin and his many disguises and accents.

mail call,"Mail Call was a television program that appeared on the History Channel and hosted by R. Lee Ermey, a retired United States Marine Corps Staff Sergeant,. The show debuted on August 4, 2002 as part of the 'Fighting Fridays' lineup. Most episodes were 30 minutes, but from 2007 through the show's end in 2009 some episodes were 60 minutes.

During each episode, Ermey read and answered questions submitted by viewers regarding weapons and equipment used by all branches of the U.S. military now or in the past, as well as by other armed forces in history. Ermey often took his viewers on location to military training areas to film demonstrations. When not on location, Ermey broadcast from a set resembling a military outpost, including a tent, a Jeep, and various other pieces of military gear which changed throughout the series. At times, he would also have a bulldog - usually symbolic of Marines, especially drill instructors - on his show as well.

Comic relief was provided as Ermey inflicted DI-style verbal abuse on his viewers or tests the effects of various weapons on watermelons and paint cans, as well as occasional appearances of ""Mini-Lee"", an action figure styled in Ermey's likeness, often seen berating a luckless G.I. Joe figurine. His demeanor as host was similar to the character ""Gunnery Sergeant Hartman"" portrayed by Ermey in the Stanley Kubrick film Full Metal Jacket, though this attitude was shown only towards his viewers and not the military special guests. Older viewers might compare him to Sergeant Vincent Carter, a character in the Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. television program.",Documentary,6.7,4.5758237611928605,0.6931471805599453,False,Ended,2.0794415416798357,4.653960350157523,3.4011973816621555,"HISTORY Vault Apple TV Channel, HISTORY Vault Amazon Channel",No reviews,R.

If one enjoys his type of corny and nonsensical scenarios from his films in the 70's, then this series is along the lines of those films.  If one is looking at this series for the martial arts elements, then you'll be disappointed too.

In this day and age when the n-word is sensitively removed from the lexicons in entertainment, media and society, then why is it still OK to repeatedly use the c-word which is equally vile, hurtful and offensive?  Just teaching and perpetuating another generation of viewers that it is OK to continue to be hateful and insulting.  This also just shows the lacking of creativeness and skillfulness in the writers' and directors' storytelling abilities--shame on them for being tone-deaf and taking the easy route.  This is not a matter of being PC, but rather the fact that the show-runners are ignorant and irresponsible in producing such crap.  Wake up folks; it is 2019 and no longer acceptable. | it was really good. It was a project that the late Bruce Lee wanted to do for so long, before his passing.

However, I am not pleased that it ended after 2 seasons, especially after where it left it! Which is why I gave it 3 and a half stars. Sorry.

Still, Warrior was a brutal and satisfying martial arts show, which would've compete against Game of Thrones. Or at least of few shows that have that potential. | I would like to be able to say I'm glad to see Warrior back on the screen for a third season but, well, I'm not. Here's why.

It was my understanding that this series was finished with season two. Season two rounded out the tale of a clash between rival Tongs in the early days of San Francisco, nicely.

The third season effectively starts without any meaningful purpose and direction and it really shows.The struggle between the Tong's is resurrected, leaving a stale feeling of deja vu. A new character or two is dropped in, along with a sprinkling of sub plots in an attempt to liven things up. That said, its not really contributing anything compelling to a tale well told. 

Adding not only to the sense of inertia but also irritation is the need to tout, the by now hoary chestnut, that is ""the message"". Alternate lifestyles, diversity and feminism are front and centre. Out of place revisionism, in a tale that's supposed to be set over 100 years ago, filled with gritty, martial arts, action.  

In summary, if you are going to resurrect a series you better have something meaningful to add to whats gone before. Warrior season three, hopes to cash in on its past success, without understanding what made the series work in previous seasons.","Andrew Koji, Olivia Cheng, Jason Tobin, Dianne Doan, Kieran Bew",1.0,False,0.0,2019.0

This war series is one of the most realistic,  accurate, detailed and comprehensive I've ever encountered.
The show is overwhelming, intriguing and some episodes can squeeze a couple of tears from you.
One of the few series that stuck in your head even a week after you've finish them.
Highly recommended. | Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/fO2DgMc97Q8

It's almost hard to believe, but it has been nearly 20 years since _Band of Brothers_ was released on HBO. _Band of Brothers_ is one of those rare examples of near perfection in a television series. In fact it to me this is not really a TV series, it's more like an incredible ten hour movie.

Based on a book of the same name written by Stephen Ambrose, this follows the real life exploits of the men of E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne. We go from their formation and training to their jump into Normandy on D-Day and stay with them right through to Germany's surrender. Over the course of ten episodes we get to know several members of the Company, and experience the horrors and brotherhood of war all the way through.

Apart from the movie level budget, cinematography, visual and make up effects, what makes it so good is that it’s not just a birds eye view of each step of their journey. In each episode we get that wider view but we also get to spend some time with a member of the Company. Whether it’s Bull getting stranded in an occupied village, Doc Roe scrounging for medical supplies in Bastogne, or Lipton narrating an entire episode, each episode brings some sort of variety from the one previous. Likewise not every episode is full of combat, across all of it there is a good balance of personal moments, tension, and all out combat action. Each of those three aspects are skilfully executed too, so the show never gets boring, there aren't any lulls.

I recently watched the movie _Midway_ and in my review of it I said that part of its downfall was trying to do too much by jamming seven months of war into two hours. _Band of Brothers_ is the perfect example of what can be done when there is more time to tell the story. It never feels rushed, it's paced perfectly and its pretty easy to keep track of who's who all the way through.

Speaking of ""who's who"" this has so many “OMG it’s that guy” moments. Given that this was made 20 years ago there are a whole bunch of now-established actors making early forays into their careers, or whom you recognise now for completely different work. Of course there's Damien Lewis and Ron Livingstone front and center, but there's also Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, James McAvoy, David Schwimmer, Simon Pegg, Jimmy Fallon, Colin Hanks, Donnie Wahlberg, and Michael Cudlitz. There are of course many more, and each episode I found myself looking up online to see if that person I spotted was the person I thought it was.

I could go on and on and on about this show. I absolutely love it, it's a masterpiece and may well be my favourite mini-series of all time. Even now, 20 years later this remains a stunning achievement in television history and it is, in my opinion, must see TV. | There are a few haters....and I mean FEW. And mostly they are of the political bend, and lets be honest, people that see politics in everything are going to hate everything.

For the rest of the world it's a really great story, very well done, very well directed, and it's segmented enough and switches focus enough to allow everyone a taste of the different characters while still focusing on the leads.

And of course the reveals the people that the actors are portraying, at the end of the miniseries, is worth all the time you devoted to it. | An amazing series which is incredibly harrowing to watch. Even more so when you consider this is based on real events and real people. This thing will turn you inside out, and it should. An excellent reminder of what so many seem to pay no mind to these days. ""Lest we forget."" | It's the journey of ordinary men who accomplished remarkable successes and left an indelible mark on history. It spans the training period that commenced in 1942 and culminated in the American triumph in World War II. What struck me profoundly was the cinematography, particularly the exquisite quality of the visuals, which allows viewers to experience the intense emotions of soldiers bracing for the next engagement. It brings you amidst the battlefield, with adrenaline and fear coursing through their and your veins. The music and sound effects are so immersive that they evoke a palpable sense of anxiety about the possibility of being shot. The Band of Brothers made significant sacrifices to forge a better world, and although they succeeded in their mission, our generation has likely fallen short in honoring their legacy. The narrative includes minimal references to the political landscape, leaving the viewer uncertain about the moral standings of the opposing sides. However, the primary focus remains on the lives of these heroes and the grim realities of war. It is conceivable that Germans and Americans could have formed lasting friendships absent the influence of their politicians. It is imperative that we do not allow our governments to stray from their intended purposes; it is our responsibility to safeguard our freedom and democracy. It's a must-watch that serves as a poignant reminder that the ""freedom"" we enjoy today was purchased at the cost of countless lives lost due to the folly of political leaders. A tragic lesson that we seem unable to learn.","Damian Lewis, Donnie Wahlberg, David Schwimmer, Eion Bailey, Ron Livingston",1.0,True,7.0,2001.0

2/10 | Title: Foundation - Apple TV+ Delivers a Galactic Triumph

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Foundation, Apple TV+'s adaptation of Isaac Asimov's classic series, is a tour de force in the sci-fi genre. Visually stunning and intellectually riveting, the series expertly captures the grandiosity of Asimov's universe.

The meticulous attention to detail in set design and visual effects creates a breathtaking backdrop for a narrative that seamlessly blends intricate political intrigue with futuristic technology. The cast, led by standout performances from Jared Harris and Lee Pace, breathes life into complex characters whose evolution adds emotional depth to the overarching plot.

Foundation explores profound themes with intelligence and accessibility, inviting both seasoned fans and newcomers to ponder the consequences of manipulating societies on a galactic scale. The series strikes a perfect balance between thoughtful storytelling and cinematic spectacle.

In conclusion, Foundation is a triumph that not only honors Asimov's legacy but propels the series into a new era of excellence. With its stellar cast, breathtaking visuals, and thought-provoking themes, Foundation is a must-watch for those seeking an unforgettable journey into the unknown. | Managing to put a series of Books into a series is no easy task especially when it covers 1000 years.

It isn't a series for everyone when you consider this, and that Isaac Asimov isn't just an advanced sci-fi writer but also a visionary almost one century before us. It is a case of love or hate especially when it involves two types of media, a filmed streaming series (with no easy task at hand) and a series of written books (with more two sequels and two prequels in a total of 7 books).

Do not attach to most of the characters as many of them obviously won't live the 1000+ span of years of the saga of the original trilogy.

The books are just magical, complex and transcending - if you like the series go read them. There are many differences of course but to go into full fidelity runs into that case of a ""book that is impossible to make a film"".

The actors are top notch into their roles and the budget that Apple spent on this one is comparable to a big budget movie (around 70M a episode), with effects on CGI and sound that should be viewed in IMAX.

If you love true sci-fi do yourself a favor and go watch it: my score is 8,7 out of 10,0 / A.","Jared Harris, Lee Pace, Lou Llobell, Leah Harvey, Laura Birn",0.0,False,0.0,2021.0

Honored, with a bow. | # One of the best TV dramas in recent memory
<b>First, a disclaimer:</b> I've not read Dicks' original version of <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>, nor do I intend to read it. I am judging the show entirely on its own merits, without any influence or critiquing related to the novel.

## On to the review!

I'm going to keep this short and simple, so you don't have to read a shit-ton of stuff and so that I don't write any spoilers. Here's what you need to know:

As a sci-fi story, <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> falls a bit short. The showrunners tried to wrap up the sci-fi bit at the end, but they did a pretty piss-poor job. Budget cuts? Rushed delivery? Who knows? Fortunately, the sci-fi aspect of this story isn't actually what makes it great.

What makes <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> great storytelling and great television is the alt-history and the in-depth character story arcs; in particular, the story of the Smiths—the highest-ranking family in the Nazis' American Reich—is absolutely fantastic. In John and Helen Smith, we get to explore what it might have meant for regular Americans to throw their lots in with the Nazi Party had the Axis powers won WWII. Through dialogue and flashbacks, we get to see how joining the Nazi Party twisted both John and Helen into persons unrecognizable from their alt-world selves. Truly, the Smiths' story arc was easily my favorite, and it is the backbone of the show. You will never feel sorry for John or Helen, but you will understand them—and you will feel sorry for their children.

Add to this mix some solid intrigue and action, plus a strong, capable female protagonist, and you will see why <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> is really good television.

Also, don't let my initial talk of the sci-fi component scare you off. The showrunners may not have done a great job of resolving that part of the story, but the characters' stories were all resolved to my satisfaction. (Well, with one exception, but...it didn't ruin the show for me.)

I recommend this show highly to people who enjoy:

- Military fiction
- Historical fiction
- Alt-historical fiction
- [Light] sci-fi
- Political intrigues/dramas/thrillers | So, the problem that we are facing with this is that the episodes exceed the story. It's the same problem that a LOT of television shows on streaming services suffer from. They have a few too many episodes for the story they are telling in the season.

About 8 episodes per season and about 5 episodes of actual story. The result is so much filler that it seems to drag and not really accomplish anything of value.

However, the story is interesting, as is the world that it is set in. Unlike A Handmaiden's Tale, or really, a lot of other shows, it doesn't feel like you are being lectured to.

But it does feel like it dragged. All they needed to do was lesson the amount of episodes to fit the story, or add a subplot or two more and it would have been a killer show.

Instead, the result is a good show that has been stretched until it's paper thin

And then season 3 hit and what was good was replaced with woke messaging. And the lectures became nonstop.

Unlike most TV comedies, it is serialized, with a continuing story that flows from one episode to the next.  It is filmed without a laugh track.

The show has six characters.  Two of them Janet and Michael (Ted Danson), operate a post-mortem world call the Good Place, and the other four, Eleanora (Kristin Bell), Chidi, Tahani, and Jason, are recently deceased humans who are bewildered to find themselves in the place. 

I find this a highly original show.  It deals with issues rarely seen in TV comedy: death and the afterlife, guilt and responsibility, but does so in highly amusing ways (One running joke is a spell that overrides swear words with innocuous ones like ""fork"" and ""shirt"", much to the irritation of characters who really feel a need to sound off).  It has a unusually diverse cast, three of the six main characters being Filipino, Asian-Indian, and Senegalese.  Since Chidi is a former philosophy professor, it also has an intellectual side as he tries to make sense of his new eternal dwelling place.  In contrast to the well-behaved ""Good Place"",  we have frequent farcical flashbacks to the characters' wild former lives, a la ""Lost"". 

For viewers looking for something different, I quite recommend this show. | Oddly Refreshing. | Not bad, but I lost interest about halfway through season two.

At the heart, it was a show about a relationship, and one marred by the pitfalls of.... living with a super hero. That was a good pitch right there, that added something to the genre that you never really saw before, and Clark was excellent for the role.

I loved the take, and (unlike Snyder) it was done right. Superman is a light character. He's not a dark and brooding character, he's light and fun, and this was able to balance adult relationship comedy with kid friendly super hero show.

the people's court,"The People's Court is an American arbitration-based reality court show currently presided over by retired Florida State Circuit Court Judge Marilyn Milian. Milian, the show's longest-reigning arbiter, handles small claims disputes in a simulated courtroom set.

The People's Court is the first court show to use binding arbitration, introducing the format into the genre in 1981. The system has been duplicated by most of the show's successors in the judicial genre. Moreover, The People's Court is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre. It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre; these short-lived predecessors were only loosely related to judicial proceedings, except for one: Parole took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings. Prior to The People's Court, the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used actors, and recreated or fictional cases. Among examples of these types of court shows include Famous Jury Trials and Your Witness.

The People's Court has had two contrasting lives. The show's first life was presided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Wapner. His tenure lasted from the show's debut on September 14, 1981, until May 21, 1993, when the show was cancelled due to low ratings. This left the show with a total of 2,484 ½-hour episodes and 12 seasons. The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life. After being cancelled, reruns aired until September 9, 1994.","Reality, Crime",6.8,4.517867857585295,2.8903717578961645,True,Returning Series,3.258096538021482,7.134890851565884,3.784189633918261,No platforms available,No reviews,,0.0,False,0.0,

A significant change in cast and premise for the 1965–66 season divides the program into two distinct eras; aside from Ball, only Gale Gordon, who joined the program for its second season, remained. For the first three seasons, Vivian Vance was the co-star.

The earliest scripts were entitled The Lucille Ball Show, but when this title was declined, producers thought of calling the show This Is Lucy or The New Adventures of Lucy, before deciding on the title The Lucy Show.

evening shade,"Evening Shade is an American sitcom television series that aired on CBS from 1990 to 1994.

Reynolds personally requested to use the Steelers as his former team because he is a fan.

The general theme of the show is the appeal of small town life. Episodes ended with a closing narration by Ossie Davis summing up the events of the episode, always closing with ""... in a place called Evening Shade."" The show's final episode saw the guest appearances of Willie Nelson and Buzz Aldrin as escaped convicts on the run from authorities, the final scene being a spectacular shoot-out reminiscent of the final scene of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

(Based on the season’s first three episodes handed to press)

Marvel delivered an unprecedentedly successful superhero universe that culminated in the record-breaking Avengers: Endgame (Spider-Man: Far from Home is actually the last movie of the Infinity Saga, but let’s ignore that). With the first overarching story ending after twenty-three films, the MCU now begins a new Era. Basically, Phase Four is truly another Phase One, where viewers will meet new heroes to root for. However, there are dozens of Avengers still in the game, including the astonishingly powerful Wanda. 

Television will play a massive role in the upcoming saga, with miniseries starring key superheroes having a significant impact in the movies. Obviously, this raises the question: do viewers need to watch the TV shows in order to understand and follow the films? I believe so. Some series might not have as much impact as others, but WandaVision will undoubtedly affect Wanda’s path in the MCU. From being one of the most powerful Avengers to the possibility of Wanda being the next big villain, this character has limitless potential. In addition to this, Elizabeth Olsen is arguably one of the best actresses in the franchise, and honestly, of her entire generation.

Therefore, even though I always try to keep my expectations as moderate as possible, I couldn’t help but feel extremely hyped for WandaVision. The series is as weird and mysterious as I expected it to be. In the first three episodes, the viewer is placed inside a black-and-white sitcom, where it becomes super clear that everything that’s happening is occurring inside Wanda’s own mind or something similar that she’s definitely responsible for. Having in mind what happened to Vision in his last movie, it seems that this series will heavily deal with sensitive matters, such as grief, depression, and unhealthy escapism. However, these first episodes are pretty much set in following the comedy route.

Boasting tons of references to the respective period of classic television, WandaVision is much more hilarious than I ever anticipated it to be. Several seemingly easy yet efficient jokes about Wanda and Vision’s powers and their nature are the ones that bring out the most generous laughter (impeccable writing from Jac Schaeffer). In this regard, I have to praise Kathryn Hahn (Agnes), whose performance as the “nosy neighbor” is wonderfully funny. Teyonah Parris doesn’t really interpret her real character yet (Monica Rambeau), but her display is rather interesting. The rest of the cast is pretty good, but it all comes down to Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, who are beautifully charming and amusing together.

Their chemistry is even more palpable now that they’re the protagonists of their own story. It’s a strange feeling watching Bettany portray Vision again, but his terrific performance comes to demonstrate that the viewer’s connection with the character is as humanly compelling as any other. However, Olsen is the real star of the show. I admit that I might be a bit biased since she is one of my favorite actresses working today, but Olsen proves why she’s worthy of bigger roles in Hollywood outside of the MCU. An unbelievable emotional range, excellent comedic timing, exquisite expressiveness, and an impressive capability of drastically and quickly changing styles. An Emmy nomination wouldn’t be surprising.

The main storyline revolves around Wanda’s apparently ideal life with Vision. How? That is the intriguing mystery, which exponentially receives more clues after each episode. A certain symbol points to an organization that will undoubtedly make Marvel fans scream with excitement, right from the very first episode (if you look closely, you’ll find it). This is the first MCU content since July 2019, so the stakes are inevitably high as Matt Shakman must fulfill the mission of bringing back the enthusiasm for the respective universe. Shakman and Schaeffer employ weirdness and unconventional storytelling that transform the series into an extremely captivating story, even though the main answer for what’s happening seems quite clear.

Technically, Christophe Beck’s score is the standout. From the timely sound effects of classic television to specific songs that play during certain moments, Beck delivers a score that elevates the overall show. The opening credits are unique and always different, referencing various Eras of television (shoutout to Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez for composing the theme music). As for the rest, terrific editing from Tim Roche, Nona Khodai, and Zene Baker. The visual effects look seamless even in black-and-white, and Jess Hall’s cinematography cleverly resembles sitcoms attributes. Outstanding production design (Mark Worthington) as well.

All in all, after only three episodes, WandaVision proves to be as weird, mysterious, and exceptionally captivating as it intends to be. Matt Shakman and Jac Schaeffer deliver a surprisingly hilarious show with just the right amount of hints to what’s truly happening. Even though the global answer seems rather predictable, creative storytelling builds an atmosphere of uncertainty and puzzling doubts that will leave viewers craving for the next episode. From the gorgeous black-and-white to Christophe Beck’s brilliant score, Wanda and Vision’s apparently ideal life is surrounded by technical attributes that pay homage to the Era of classic television. Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, and Kathryn Hahn are all fantastic, but Elizabeth Olsen is the indisputable star, showing her undeniable acting talent that might very well earn her an Emmy nod. As the first MCU content in more than a year, WandaVision conquered my full attention for the remaining episodes, which surely hold impactful revelations. It’s still unclear the real influence it will have in the films’ realm, but I can only assume it’s significant. Do not miss it!

Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, and Kathryn Hahn are all fantastic, but Elizabeth Olsen is the indisputable star, showing her undeniable acting talent that might very well earn her an Emmy nod. As the first MCU content in more than a year, WandaVision conquered my full attention for the remaining episodes, which surely hold impactful revelations. It’s still unclear the real influence it will have in the films’ realm, but I can only assume it’s significant. Do not miss it!

Post-Finale Review
(based on the remaining episodes and the entire season) 

The following six episodes couldn't be better. The decade-spanning homage to sitcoms continues, but it exponentially decreases its attempts at humor and silly slapstick. As expected, a much more dramatic, emotional storyline takes hold of the narrative, each episode coming closer to give the viewers answers to the dozens of questions raised by the previous episodes. A few more puzzles arise with the introduction/revelation of characters who will definitely leave the audience incredibly excited, but it's the focus on Wanda's feelings that ultimately elevates this miniseries to some of the best content in the genre of superheroes.

The study of Wanda's grief and what she did to deal with the loss of the ones she loved the most is by far the most mysteriously fascinating aspect of the entire show. Even though most of Wanda's actions seem quite predictable from the get-go - especially in a non-detailed perspective - the storytelling choices and paths that Matt Shakman and the team of screenwriters come up with are quite imaginative. Every single viewer will remember a specific sentence forever since it's so powerful that it can even work as a healing mechanism to many people going through pain similar to Wanda's. Brilliant writing, from the pilot to the finale.

One massive advantage of one-season series is their immunity to ridiculously illogical, absurd fan theories and social media pressure, simply because it's already finished before the first episodes airs, so there's no way of the show getting influenced by the public's opinion. It's fun to theorize with friends and attempt to figure out what's truly happening, but when it reaches the levels of excessive fanboyism, it becomes dangerously annoying and hurtful to fans themselves. People create the most ludicrous theories surrounding characters and storylines based on incredibly ambiguous and subjective ""clues"" that are far from being remotely significant. Consequently, irrealistic expectations lead many of these fans to an impending letdown once the finale comes around.

Fortunately, I stayed sane and kept my expectations grounded, waiting patiently for the show to amaze me. The finale is a near-perfect ending to an utterly impressive series that will impact the future of the upcoming MCU series. Many viewers - mainly hardcore fans - will find it disappointing due to the inevitable dismissal of hyped theories, but overall, WandaVision will end up as a positive experience for a significant majority. I really only have minor issues with a particular episode where the overwhelming fan-service risks the logic of its presence, Josh Stamberg's annoyingly cliche character, and a certain outcome left a bit too vague for the series finale.

WandaVision is truly some of the best content ever seen in the genre of superheroes. From the mysteriously unconventional storytelling that never ceased to be incredibly captivating to the beautiful homage to decade-defining sitcoms, Jac Schaeffer and Matt Shakman approach grief and the different ways people handle it in an undoubtedly impactful manner. Despite the main narrative following a predictable path, the theory-inducing side stories and secondary characters throw the audience in loops of constant doubt, ultimately generating a surreal amount of hype for the next episode. The series never loses focus of its emotional core, which is connected to one of the greatest pros of one-season shows: these can't be influenced by absurd fan theories and online pressure. Both Elizabeth Olsen and Wanda prove they're part of the strongest members of the MCU, with the actress delivering an Emmy-worthy performance (shockingly outstanding range) and the character showing her true power prompted by her solitude and persevering love. Paul Bettany, Teyonah Parris, and Kathryn Hahn are magnificent as well, but in the end, it was Wanda's show all along.

Rating: A | So many missed opportunities in this series makes for a disappointing watch, although the series does end on a higher note.  

The premise is sound - a powerful mutant (oh, we're not allowed to use that word) - sorry, witch, is grieving for her love and reverts to what she thinks is the idealised family - based on TV sitcoms.  Here you could do so much - an episode per decade (nup, some are randomly skipped), add in creepy themes (this is started, but never really done well), expound on the puppet-master theme, explore grieving, or having a family as a Supe, or trying to be normal. You could mash up the Truman Show with Pleasantville and the Incredibles with a touch of the Stepford Wives (and even have them caused by the antagonist of the series to either try to gain a friend, or to unnerve and outdo Wanda - seriously, is the antagonist just evil with no human desires?).  But we got this average slump of a series which wants to be more...a whole lot more.

Plusses - Olsen and Bettany are on form and seem to relish the increased screen time for the characters - their magic show is a highlight of the droll early episodes.  The minor cast are great too with Caulfield and Hahn being highlights.  Remarkably, Dennings is held back which (compared to her last showing in the Dark World) we are all thankful for.  And the set design and score are masterful showing true homage to the shows that came before.  

Negatives - Besides the aforementioned lost opportunities, there is an added plot about the military which was not needed (could have just had this set in Wanda's head and expounded more on the creepiness of this concept).  Canned laughter is over used to the extreme - none of the shows referenced used it that much, and this is not even a plot point to signify that something is wrong with the world.  Characters appear and disappear and are not followed up on,  nor is there explanation given as to why (eg Quicksilver).  And consequences have no place here.  

In such a hyped up show, I was expecting more than this droll output which fails to shine despite the best intentions of Bettany, Olsen and the cast.  

My hopes for something outstandingly creepy or scary from the next Dr Strange movie are now definitely lessened. | _WandaVision_ is a fairly standard MCU entry disguised as a unique MCU entry, and its biggest problem is a lack of commitment to the bit. The eerie set-up of an idealistic, suburban rom com used as a false life for Wanda to live is genius(!!) and deserves **so** much better than being knocked to the curb by the final few episodes in exchange for more bland concepts. The scattered focus with all the characters means that not one idea really gets as much development as you would hope, which is especially prevalent once the whole thing wraps up. By the time you really get a grasp of the true extent of Wanda's struggle, you're pretty much at the final episode, and the established style through TV shows of the era is absent.

It's too bad, because I didn't really dislike any of the plot threads either, they just sort of come and go? I think Darcy Lewis adds plenty to the series, but there needed to be more of her to prevent her from just seeming like a front for a boatload of exposition. Jimmy Woo is **always** a treat, but I don't know why his run-in with the ""surprise"" antagonist was made out to be as big a deal as it was when it's really only a temporary inconvenience that adds nothing to anything?

Wanda's entanglements go all over the place, from memories of her husband, her brother, to even her desire for kids. It's a lot to tackle, and I just don't think the writers stuck the landing. The measures Wanda takes for sake of conformity and repression of her past were such strong themes that for a second I thought the series was going to commit to making her the antagonist, which would've been a cool inversion of the hero in comparison to where she was before. This angle could've also helped emphasize the true damage that can come from acting on your grief with no rhyme or reason. The bittersweet peaks of the show between the two title characters are powerful when done right, and sometimes even made me want to bat an 8/10 for the show. Unfortunately, everything I mentioned with Wanda is scrapped for another surprise twist villain instead, and the finale just turns into every Marvel fight ever, so no, the show did not end up meeting its own goals.

Overall a kind of cool experience, but I already can't remember half the characters or episodes, so I don't think this will be sticking with me for very long.

I'm really happy the MCU is transitioning into TV shows for what that's worth. | Great start to the Disney+ MCU TV Shows. Really different from the rest of the MCU in the structure of sitcoms and TV dramas. The episodic nature really brought fun fan theories and conjecture to the show week after week that really made the show way more enjoyable as a fan. Great set up for the Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness.

**Verdict:** _Great_ | This was perfection. Way to tell a unresolved story that needed resolving. Heartbreaking but fun. Recommend to ALL Marvel fans.

Wanda was never a character I cared for or really wanted to explore beyond the basics. However, thanks to this show, I absolutely love Wanda. I feel like most of us can relate to her in not wanting to let go of someone you love ... And you go so far as to wrap them in this bubble in your mind/heart.

Every person in this series delivered PERFECTION. Elizabeth Olsen is superb. | WandaVision is a bold, genre-bending triumph that redefines what superhero storytelling can be. The series opens with a surreal plunge into classic TV sitcoms, paying homage to I Love Lucy and Bewitched—a bold move that quickly proves its worth. WandaVision reminds us that emotional stakes can hit the hardest in a universe of super-powered battles.

Elizabeth Olsen is mesmerizing. Her portrayal of Wanda Maximoff is a masterclass in character evolution, as she moves effortlessly between sitcom whimsy and gut-wrenching emotional depth. Wanda’s desperate attempt to control her unraveling world is heartbreaking and terrifying, and Olsen makes you feel every ounce of that pain. Paul Bettany matches her performance with a comedic brilliance that brings new layers to Vision, turning their shared scenes into captivating emotional duets.

But WandaVision is far more than a love letter to nostalgia—it’s a fully immersive experience. Each episode meticulously recreates a different TV era, from the black-and-white charm of the 1950s to the neon flash of the 80s. The period details, from set designs to costumes, are spot-on, giving the series a rich visual texture. You’d be forgiven for thinking you were watching an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show—until the cracks in the facade start to show, hinting at a far darker reality lurking underneath.

Visually, WandaVision is a feast. The shifting aesthetics aren’t just clever flourishes but integral to the story. As the series moves through different eras of TV, the visual style mirrors Wanda’s emotional unraveling. The glossy perfection of early sitcoms begins to fracture, reflecting the way grief and trauma distort her perception of reality. This isn’t just a fun gimmick—it’s a profoundly affecting metaphor for Wanda’s internal collapse, making her unravel something you feel as much as you see.

At its core, WandaVision is about grief, trauma, and identity. Wanda isn’t just mourning Vision—she’s grappling with who she is after everything she’s lost. Her immense power allows her to bend reality to her will, yet she’s unable to confront the emotional wreckage inside. The show visually represents this struggle, with each glitch and shift in her constructed reality as a metaphor for her fractured sense of self. WandaVision brilliantly captures a woman at war with her identity, trying to reconcile her past, pain, and future.

This identity crisis shapes Wanda’s every decision. Unable to let go of her trauma, she creates a world where she can hide from it. But as the cracks in her illusion grow, it becomes clear that even her immense power can’t protect her from the truth. The show’s layered narrative and visual style turn Wanda’s story into a poignant meditation on how trauma reshapes our sense of self and how running from grief only deepens the wounds.

One scene that perfectly encapsulates this tension is the dinner sequence in the first episode. What starts as a lighthearted sitcom fare quickly spirals into something unsettling as Wanda struggles to control her reality. The laughter fades, the lighting shifts and the discomfort is palpable as her carefully constructed world teeters on the edge of collapse. In moments like these, WandaVision masterfully balances its tonal shifts, moving from quirky homage to psychological thriller with a deft touch.

The series is a slow burn, but that deliberate pacing makes its emotional depth possible. WandaVision takes its time, allowing the audience to sit with Wanda’s grief and confusion. This might feel jarring for some, especially for those expecting the fast-paced action Marvel is known for. But this slower pace is essential to the show’s impact—it gives the emotional stakes time to breathe, and the payoff is worth the wait. As Wanda’s world unravels, the tension builds not through action but through her illusions’ slow, steady collapse.

Marvel’s decision to prioritize emotional complexity over explosive action in WandaVision significantly departs from its usual formula. This shift signals a broader evolution in superhero media that embraces introspection and character-driven storytelling. WandaVision shows that superhero stories can be just as much about our internal battles as the external ones, setting a new standard for what the genre can achieve.

While Olsen and Bettany are the heart of the series, the supporting cast also shines. Kathryn Hahn is a standout as Agnes, bringing comedic flair and a sinister undercurrent to her role. Her shift from a nosy neighbor to something far more ominous is one of the series’ most thrilling transformations. Teyonah Parris, as Monica Rambeau, adds emotional depth to the broader MCU connections, grounding the story while bringing her vulnerabilities to the forefront. Monica’s own experience with loss, having been snapped away and returning to find her mother gone, mirrors Wanda’s grief, adding layers to the show’s exploration of trauma. Both actresses enhance the ensemble, making WandaVision a rich tapestry of performances.

Matt Shakman and Jac Schaeffer deserve immense credit for crafting a show that blends absurdity with emotional resonance. The tonal shifts—from sitcom pastiche to psychological horror—could have easily derailed the narrative, but instead, they heighten the series’ complexity. Shakman’s direction and Schaeffer’s writing push the boundaries of superhero storytelling, resulting in a series that feels as innovative as it does intimate.

Another scene that stands out is Wanda’s confrontation with Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn) in later episodes. This moment exemplifies the total collapse of Wanda’s illusion, and Agatha’s role as a manipulator intensifies the tension. The scene is a high-stakes emotional showdown that strips away Wanda’s defenses, forcing her to confront the pain she’s buried under layers of sitcom facades. This confrontation highlights the show’s seamless ability to shift from personal drama to supernatural spectacle, all while keeping the emotional core intact.

Of course, WandaVision isn’t for everyone. Its experimental structure and slower pacing may alienate viewers expecting the fast-paced, action-heavy fare typical of the MCU. But for those willing to embrace its reflective nature, the series offers a more profound, more emotionally charged experience. It’s a gamble that pays off in ways that redefine what superhero television can be.

WandaVision isn’t just a standout in the MCU—it’s a standout in modern television. Its blend of genres and experimentation with form transcends the superhero genre, positioning itself alongside Legion, which uses genre as a framework to explore deep emotional and psychological territory. WandaVision proves that superhero stories can be as rich, layered, and complex as any prestige drama, showing that sometimes, the most compelling battles are the ones we fight within ourselves.

So, is WandaVision a triumph? Absolutely. By blending sitcom nostalgia with emotional depth and mind-bending twists, WandaVision redefines what superhero storytelling can be. Marvel has set a new bar for its TV future, and if this is the direction they’re headed, count me in.","Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Kathryn Hahn, Teyonah Parris, Randall Park",0.0,False,0.0,2021.0

I liked the first Castlevania series. While it wasn&#39;t perfect, it did grow on me and had some amazing animations and memorable characters. This new series though, fails at all that, but works as a great sleeping pill.

First off, the obvious: the animations are a let down, except for maybe one fight. Gone is the gorgeous spell slinging from the first.

The writing is incredibly weak. You can tell that the writers are on strike and the story was written by chatgpt prefixed with &#34;imagine that you are a teenager with Tourette...&#34;. The review title is an actual quote from the show, I kid you not.

The story is filled with cliches and there were so many deus ex machina and woman in the fridge tropes that I lost count. The French revolution should have made for an interesting background setting (and a much better story), except the show does very little with it. There&#39;s an amorphous &#34;revolution&#34; that apparently threatens vampires by listening to their teenage girl leader, and then running away when the fighting starts.

The only saving grace is the great, creepy music, but that&#39;s nowhere near enough to save this show from mediocrity.","Edward Bluemel, Thuso Mbedu, Pixie Davies, Sydney James Harcourt, Nastassja Kinski",0.0,False,0.0,2023.0

An HBO show with an all-star cast, created by the co-creator of the magnificent Lost. How could it all go wrong? And yet, it almost did. Season 1 at first glance was an inconsistent, tumultuous show of middling quality. Moments of genuine quality interspersed with plodding mediocrity. That said, upon a rewatch, my opinion of it significantly improved. It always was a good show, with some truly mesmerising moments (see Holy Wayne hugging Nora). Season 2 is where it really came alive, however. Whereas season 1 might have seemed overly gimmicky and lacking focus, season 2 delivered a truly engaging, engrossing story with the perfect mix of excitement, surreality and detailed characterisation. By season 3, critics were hailing it as one of the greatest shows of all time.

Season 3 introduced the typical Leftovers’ blend of humour, the bizarre (dogs taking over the world?), entertainment and gut-wrenching misery. Like the other magnificent, emotionally driven, character based show of recent times ‘Rectify’, this show could be considered ‘misery porn’. Though I love it! However, I do feel season 3 is something I will need to watch again. It had many moments of great quality, and it was excellent, but it felt almost a bit too chaotic and lacking focus at times. Moving on, whilst the show has a very strong cast, Justin Theroux is the real acting heavyweight. Indeed, the man is an acting God who should be a Hollywood A lister. Scott Glenn was spectacular in season 3 and Carrie Coon, plus Christopher Eccleston, were never anything short of magnificent. Eccleston’s episodes were always great and full of substance; whilst Coon excelled in the finale, signing off with great aplomb.

I have now watched this episode twice and both times I was struck by the exposition early on, where Nora reveals how she was allowed access to the chamber. For a show as adult and intellectual as this, it’s clumsy; however, it’s a minor gripe. The show soon made up for it with one of the first truly emotive scenes in an episode with a plethora of them. Matt and Nora said goodbye - joking at first - then Matt revealed his crisis of faith, and how petrified he was of perishing due to his cancer, leaving his son growing up without a father. It’s all very raw and visceral, and an incredible engagement resonates with the audience, to a level which very few shows have ever been capable of doing. Reminiscing about losing her kids, Nora steps into the chamber and says goodbye to her brother. There’s various flashbacks to old scenes in this episode, and it works as an homage to the show, much like the recent Trainspotting sequel did to the former (see the closing scene teasing the introduction of The Prodigy’s remix of Lust for life, before breaking into the credits, for an education in how to close a movie). It’s all constructed with tremendous finesse.

After getting into the chamber, time skips forward many years into the future, and an aged Nora is now living a new life in Australia. We’re given no explanation regarding what’s transpired since, and initially it’s unclear if she’s even in ‘our’ world. Kevin soon tracks her down, pretending he thinks they never had a relationship, and only briefly knew each other. The new Kevin seems softened, with restrained emotion. The audience is left unclear whether he’s telling the truth and everything is a bit ambiguous. It’s worth pointing out that this episode showcases the startling cinematography and stylistic techniques that illustrates this show’s quality. We see some truly beautiful shots of the Australian landscape and the production values are that of a big budget Hollywood movie.

Nora agrees to take Kevin up on an invitation to attend a ‘dance’, later revealed to be a wedding. Guests at this wedding are expected to wear beads. Nora rejects, and afterwards beads are placed around a goat’s neck, which proves significant later. The best scene of the entire show soon occurs, and one of the most powerful I have ever seen. The soulful, soothing elegance of ‘I’ve Got Dreams to Remember’, by Otis Redding starts playing and both characters proceed to dance. The music plays in harmony with the events construed and it all just blends to perfection in a scene dripping with sentiment. Kevin breaks down in tears of joy, but Nora tells him that this is fake and storms off, just as the crescendo really builds. The melancholic music plays out and Kevin is left standing as a broken man, drowning in misery. The Leftovers isn’t just a TV show, it’s a work of art.

Later on, Nora hears a goat whining in agony up a hill: the goat from the wedding has become tangled in a fence due to the beads. As the empowering, classical theme music builds, thunder roars, and Nora removes the tangled beads, placing them around her neck. She looks to the pitch black sky and the intense music culminates. Now accepting the beads, Nora is finally embracing her sins. The biblical references are obvious and the haunting imagery is incredibly powerful. The characters in The Leftovers are morally ambiguous and that is part of the show’s quality. Nora is capable of doing some quite reprehensible things and can be quite horrible to people. She is a highly flawed, but ultimately good person.

We soon see the real Kevin Garvey. He tracks down Nora again, breaks down and reveals he has spent all these years searching all over Australia for her. The emotion is overpowering. His excuse for his different recollection of events was he wanted to start afresh. The reasoning is a little flimsy, but it makes for an interesting story! The final scene soon plays out and whilst the wedding scene might be the créme de la créme of The Leftovers, this scene couldn’t be more emphatically emotive. The twist is revealed, though it’s of little consequence. This was a show focusing on dialogue and characterisation, with themes of tragedy, redemption and love permeating through it. Nora reveals that she did find her family, but they were happy, and so ultimately she travelled back. She desperately missed Kevin, but couldn’t tell him the truth. I know there’s some theories that Nora is lying, but I prefer to go with the events as they were explained. Kevin tells her he believes her, engulfed in tears, and the emotion displayed is incredible. Having spent a huge chunk of his life searching for her, he now has his woman again.

As the closing credits played out I sat in silence, awestruck by the magnificence I had just watched. While San Junipero was an excellent recent TV episode with similar themes, this obliterated it. The Leftovers was a show that had all manner of bizarre happenings - and a hugely talented ensemble cast - but the finale just focused on two characters and attempted nothing spectacular. And how it succeeded. The show ended on a rare happy note and it’s a real shame a show of this quality only lasted three seasons. Still, if people are happy to sit through 12 seasons of The Big Bang Theory, that’s their prerogative. Farewell to The Leftovers, one of the greatest shows of all time.

four star playhouse,"Four Star Playhouse is an American television anthology series that ran from 1952 to 1956, sponsored in its first bi-weekly season by The Singer Company; Bristol-Myers became an alternate sponsor when it became a weekly series in the fall of 1953. The original premise was that Charles Boyer, Ida Lupino, David Niven, and Dick Powell would take turns starring in episodes. However, several other performers took the lead from time to time, including Ronald Colman and Joan Fontaine.

Blake Edwards was among the writers and directors who contributed to the series. Edwards created the recurring character of illegal gambling house operator Willie Dante for Dick Powell to play on this series. The character was later revamped and spun off in his own series starring Howard Duff, then-husband of Lupino.

## Sweet Tooth

Today I enjoyed: Sweet Tooth.

Sweet Tooth follows the character of the same nickname on a quest in a post apocalyptic world. And while this sounds like the premise of a ton of shows and movies out there, I thought it had a fresh approach and some good ideas. We quickly learn about ""The Sick"", which caused ""The great crumble"", which killed billions of people and ended society as we know it. ""The Sick"" seems to have been inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the writers neither try to shove it down the viewers throats, nor do they overdo the similarity. It is just something I could not overlook.

The show focuses on the main character by the name of Gus, or Sweet Tooth by nickname. We get to know him in Yellowstone National Park, where he and his father live. But the idyllic live gets disturbed one day and ultimately Gus has to go on a journey, that will not only change him and his life, but also the whole world and the remainders of humankind.

I liked this show for several reasons: First I love to see Nonso Anozie on a good show again. Secondly Gus is a great, sympatric character and is delivered nicely by Christian Convery. Third, the show has a lot of kids in it - which is very relevant to the story as you will quickly learn - and that works very well in this case. The characters are likeable, and the kids are doing a great job bringing them to live. The supporting cast also works well, but I cannot mention them all here. Let me close with James Brolin, who does the voice-over, and I fell a bit in love with his voice.

Overall, I really enjoyed this show and I cannot wait for the next season. Sure there are some well known tropes and story beads, but there is something fresh about this show and the characters are likeable, believable and mostly competently played. And there are definitely some characters sticking out, which you will spot along the way.

I can wholeheartedly recommend this show, enjoy!

I cannot express just how much of a colossal failure the live-action adaptation of ""One Piece"" is. It's as if the creators set out to destroy everything that made the original series a beloved masterpiece.

First and foremost, the casting is abysmal. The characters we know and love from the manga and anime are portrayed by actors who seem completely disinterested and utterly incapable of capturing the essence of their respective roles. Luffy is supposed to be a charismatic and energetic pirate, but the actor chosen to play him brings nothing but wooden expressions and lacklustre acting. It's painful to watch.

The costumes and makeup are equally atrocious. The characters look like they're wearing cheap Halloween costumes, and the make-up is so overdone that it's almost comical. It's clear that the production team had no respect for the source material or its dedicated fanbase.

The special effects are laughably bad. The CGI used to bring the Devil Fruits to life is cringe-worthy, and the action sequences are poorly choreographed and lack any sense of excitement or tension. Even the ship, the Going Merry, looks like it was made out of cardboard and painted with a preschooler's art supplies.

The storyline is an absolute mess. The pacing is all over the place, with major plot points rushed through and insignificant filler scenes dragged out for what feels like an eternity. It's as if the writers had no understanding of what made the original story so engaging and decided to throw in random elements to see what sticks.

But perhaps the most unforgivable sin of this live-action adaptation is how it completely disregards the heart and soul of ""One Piece."" The series is known for its deep and meaningful themes of friendship, freedom, and adventure, but this adaptation reduces it to a mindless, soulless spectacle that is devoid of any substance or emotion.

In short, ""One Piece"" (Live Action) is an absolute disaster that should never have seen the light of day. It's an insult to the original series and its dedicated fanbase, and it's a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved anime and manga into live-action. Save yourself the agony and skip this travesty of a show. | s1: My love of one piece,and underwhelming/ rushed final arc and too many close shots that tries to hide environment as much as possible force me to not rate this anything above 7.5. 

This series felt like first professional dish by a new chef, being guided by  of a demanding MasterChef. where you can criticises elements like too many closed setting, lot of terrible child acting, etc, but you can't  ignore the quality of the dish, and you expect an even greter product in the future. | As a complete anime novice, approaching ""One Piece"" (2023) was a leap of faith. I'm accustomed to live-action, grounded narratives, not cartoonish worlds with fantastical elements. But driven by a desire to explore the world of anime, I dove in headfirst, and to my surprise, was swept away by the captivating story and vibrant characters.

The series centers around Monkey D. Luffy, a cheerful and energetic pirate captain with a rubber body. Honestly, Luffy's infectious enthusiasm is what initially drew me in. His genuine spirit and boundless optimism were refreshing, and I found myself becoming just as energized after each episode. He reminded me to approach the world with a sense of fun and wonder, a quality I deeply appreciate.

Beyond Luffy, the entire cast is a colorful tapestry of unique and memorable characters. The plot itself is a thrilling adventure, keeping me hooked from beginning to end.

What truly blew me away was the level of imagination and creativity woven into the story. The author's wild and refreshing fantasies, like a restaurant in the middle of the ocean or a female pirate with incredible powers, opened my mind to possibilities I never considered. It challenged my perception of the world, reminding me that reality can be far more fantastical than I initially imagined.

I've heard this type of imaginative storytelling is a staple of the anime genre, and I must say, I'm completely hooked. While the traditional anime style didn't quite resonate with me, this live-action adaptation was a perfect entry point. It managed to capture the spirit of the source material without sacrificing its visual appeal or the depth of its characters.

""One Piece"" is a reminder that sometimes, the best stories are the ones that embrace the extraordinary. It's an adventure, a comedy, and a heartwarming tale all rolled into one, and I can't wait to see what Luffy and his crew get up to next. This series has not only introduced me to the world of anime, but it's also reignited my sense of wonder and joy in storytelling.","Iñaki Godoy, Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Jacob Gibson, Vincent Regan",0.0,False,0.0,2023.0

When Lower Decks first came out, I gave it a bad review and now I would like to make up for that. It's not that I disagree with my earlier reviews, they were accurate regarding the episodes back then. But I do feel that since then and especially now in Season 3 they have become so much more than just another animated sitcom or just another Star Trek parody. NOW it finally starts to feel like actual Star Trek, which is the highest praise a Trekkie can give - especially considering that there is so much ""NuTrek"" around now, yet none of the other shows - including and especially even the live action shows - truly feel like Star Trek. Well, okay, Strange New Worlds isn't half bad either, but that's also because I can't wait for their crossover with this show!

The problem was that initially, me and many other fans couldn't understand how an over the top animated parody, could be more like Star Trek than say that other show about vineyards. But it truly is and it's more than just a parody. Roddenberry described Star Trek as ""Guliver's Travels in space"". And of course Guliver's Travels has always been a satire and a parody - though be it a parody of the society of its time. And of course if you criticize your contemporary society, you need to figure out some way to get around censorship. And of course the classic trick is to just pretend that it's not talking about our present society, but about some remote island/planet that just so happens to look exactly like the contemporary society of the author. But thanks to both Jonathan and Gene, that trick is now so old and so well known, that no studio executive in the world is going to be fooled by it anymore, which is exactly the reason why the other NuTrek shows don't feel like Star Trek anymore.

Lower Decks on the other hand uses the fact that as an animated parody it's prone to not be taken as serious, and so it's easier for them to fly under the radar and hide their criticism about contemporary issues (even if it's mainly criticism of NuTrek itself) among a myriad of jokes, Easter eggs and 4th wall breaks. It's literally ""lower decks"" and lower decks won't stand out (among the many other shows with a higher budget and bigger stars) and in fact they are counting on that and that's why once I realized that, I now absolutely love and adore them. Which explains why initially they did more of a parody, but starting with this episode and this season, they increasingly drop the disguise and have some real stories and messages underneath all the overt silliness.","Tawny Newsome, Jack Quaid, Noël Wells, Eugene Cordero, Dawnn Lewis",0.0,False,0.0,2020.0

An interesting story. A sh*tty execution. I mean, people are spread on more than one planet, they can move experiences from one body to another and all you get is curved screens, tablets, and minor variations to Google's Material Design? I'd have appreciated to cut the fighting part off the show, and spend the money for a decent futuristic design. Or maybe that's why one guy is Kubrick and these ones are the guys with a canceled NetFlix show. 

And, of course, the only sexual desires can be heterosexual. Women, on the other hand don't seem to be anything more refined than a simple accessory, unless they work for the Big Brother and they are protecting the safety of those who are the system.

As for the bad guys: Russians. You know, the minimal White courtesy of not sending you a brown person. 

I would have also appreciated less Marxism, but it is a British writer and over there they don't conceive the World otherwise.

In the end, the main problem is the ending. It is very badly done. Each evil character is going to reveal and explain the plans like in the more ridiculed Hollywood movies. And the political agenda becomes obvious the only motivation for the series. I'd say skip the last two episodes, but that would mean to also lose the point of watching the rest of the series. | The only series I have watched a minimum of three times per year since it first aired. 

This is partly because there are only two seasons, but mostly because I enjoy cyberpunk, sci-fi, the little details I pick up each time I watch, stories that tackle the human condition, and the overall idea behind the plot.

This will be by no means an in-depth review, even after years of watching it and its release, but if you are into any of my previously mentioned reasons for rewatching this so many times, you will enjoy the majority of season one.

And if you're a hopeless romantic, you'll also enjoy most of season two. 

You may see comments/reviews around the web of people hating Season 2 due to inconsistencies in the main character's behaviour. But after watching this series several times, I can say without a doubt that the character's personality was set up to become a hopeless romantic even from Season 1. Even one of the theme songs is hopelessly romantic. And finally, there is a time jump of 30 years between Seasons 1 and 2 - a person's character/mannerisms/moral code/etc. can change in 30 years, especially when they have been failing for 30 years.

It took me several rewatches to see it, but now that I do, I've upgraded my review from a 9 to a 10. This is perfect.

I've enjoyed this so much that I'm now reading the books, which have very different stories and timelines, and I love both equally at the moment.","Anthony Mackie, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Chris Conner, Lela Loren, Simone Missick",1.0,False,0.0,2018.0

It reflected the social and cultural ideologies of the 1980s and early 1990s, and many of the cases featured on the show dealt with hot-topic issues such as abortion, racism, gay rights, homophobia, sexual harassment, AIDS, and domestic violence. The series often also reflected social tensions between the wealthy senior lawyer protagonists and their less well-paid junior staff.

However, more so than any of the other Super Hero shows on the CW, it suffers HEAVILY under the mark of the CW. Just when you think it's going to take a good turn, the CW teenage focused melodrama is injected into it and takes the wind out of it's sails.

It would be forgivable if it happened once, but it seems to get neutered by the CW every time it takes what promises to be heading into a good direction. It could have dealt with race relations in an entertaining and dramatic manner...but then it turns into a CW manner and it turns into a melodrama.

_Interior Chinatown_ is a brilliant yet understated reflection of the world—a mirror that exposes how society often judges people by their covers. The show captures this poignantly with the scene where Willis Wu can’t get into the police precinct until he proves his worth by delivering food. It’s a powerful metaphor: sometimes, if you don’t fit the mold, you have to prove your value in the most degrading or unexpected ways just to get a foot in the door. The locked precinct doors represent barriers faced by those who don’t match the “majority’s” idea of what’s acceptable or valuable.

While the series centers on the Asian and Pacific Islander (API) community and the stereotypical roles Hollywood has long relegated them to—background extras, kung fu fighters—it forces viewers to confront bigger questions. It makes you ask: **Am I complicit in perpetuating these stereotypes? Am I limiting others—or even myself—by what I assume is their worth?** It’s not just about API representation; it’s about how society as a whole undervalues anyone who doesn’t fit neatly into its preferred narrative.

The show can feel confusing if you don’t grasp its satirical lens upfront. But for me, knowing the context of Charles Yu’s original book helped it click. The production team does an incredible job balancing satire with sincerity, blurring the line between real life and the exaggerated Hollywood “procedural” format. They cleverly use contrasting visuals and distinct camera work to draw you into different headspaces—Hollywood’s glossy expectations versus the grittier reality of life.

Chloe Bennet’s involvement (real name Chloe Wang) ties into the show’s themes on a deeply personal level. She famously changed her last name to navigate Hollywood, caught in the impossible middle ground of not being “Asian enough” or “white enough” for casting directors. It’s a decision that sparks debate—was it an act of survival, assimilation, or betrayal? But for Bennett, it was about carving a space for herself to pursue her dreams.

This theme echoes in one of the show’s most poignant scenes, where Lana is told, “You will never completely understand. You’re mixed.” It’s a crushing acknowledgment of the barriers that persist, even when you’re trying to bridge divides. Lana’s story highlights how identity can be both a strength and an obstacle, and the line serves as a painful reminder of the walls society creates—externally and internally.

_Interior Chinatown_ doesn’t just ask us to look at the system; it forces us to examine ourselves. Whether it’s Willis Wu at the precinct door or Lana trying to connect in a world that sees her as neither this nor that, the show unflinchingly portrays the struggle to belong. And as viewers, it challenges us to question our role in those struggles: Are we helping to dismantle the barriers, or are we quietly reinforcing them?","Jimmy O.

I can't speak of the adaptation, as I could not be bothered to check out the comics. But, by current standards, the story is very good. It has holes, but overall the story goes smooth. I can see the roots of *American Gods* in *The Sandman*.

The casting is good. The acting is smooth. The designs are beautiful, and I guess the merit goes to the artist that drew the comics.

Most writers today just go one more. Like the mobster in *Casino*, if you attack the character with a knife, the character will bring a gun. Nothing special. Gaiman goes some place else. So bad he has given up writing. Take for example the fight in Episode 4. I have never seen something like that. I'm not saying it wasn't done, but it's different by current writing standards. | Story is very interesting. Soundtracks are great and special effects are beautiful, however woke culture agenda is ruining all the experience with its forced diversity and LGBT propaganda. Another thing I didn't like was death representation. Death is usually represented as a hooded male character with scythe which associates with fear, but in this TV show death is played by black female actress and she's smiling, laughing, joking and eating an apple. Come on! Do they even realize how stupid it all looks? | Another show ruined by modern writers. Don't get me wrong, story is OK, acting is good and many more good things ruined by wokeness. That's why I gave it score 5/10, otherwise it wood be 8/10. | Very good special effects (for Streaming/TV viewing), and good story line with good characters. (wait for it...)
 
TOO BAD, it's attached thoroughly to a sinisterly liberal wagon.  If you don't know what I mean, just think of everything that ruins a show for someone who is NOT gay, overweight w/colored hair, body piercings, unconcealable tattoos, and insufferably annoying.  

I made it to the episode where the Sandman got his ruby back, but then I had to let the show go.  That re-writing John Constatine into a self-serving closed minded assho-- I mean, gay woman in her late twenties, was abysmal.  The diner scene was just as god-awful in writing, if not theme.  I wasn't even happy when the Sandman finally got his ruby back; just relieved I no longer had to keep watching the show.  

It really is a shame how ludicrously far the writing in Hollywood as fallen behind or under intersectional politics & woke agenda.  smh | Ignore the homophobic, racist and everyphobic reviews, but maybe also avoid this show.

Neil Gaiman might be a good writer, but as with American Gods, the moment he gets involved with live-action adaptations, the quality apparently goes out the window. Kudos to him for defending the casting choices though.

A few episodes from season 1 stand out, specifically episodes 1, 4, and 6. The rest are fine but just not worth it. The mid-season climax leaves a lot to be desired and apparently is so insignificant that it has no lasting impact on the world and no one bothers to mention it again. By the end I had lost so much interest in it that I didn't even bother to return for the bonus episode, and it allegedly has a cat. I love cats.

The casting is mostly good, but there's just too many plot holes and pointless guff.

Oscar Isaac was awesome as always and his British accent was really impressive; Ethan Hawke was okay (he did not really have much to do), and the rest of the cast was good as well. No real criticism for this one, I have to see the other episodes, because the true value of this origin story really depends on them. The music is well chosen, the cinematography is unusually good for a Marvel production and the overall quality really sold me. I'm in | Better than expected, this is not the normal marvel formula and they really gave it a suspenseful dark vibe. Would love to see this character in upcoming MCU movies | It was so good.. I'll attempt to refrain from spoiling things, but 99% of the show was so incredibly good, and a solid 9 imho, and that's coming from someone who generally doesn't care at all for the marvel franchise apart from iron man and deadpool..

But then came the last 4 minutes of the show, which was so unbelievably trash, from the ""I've killed hundreds of henchmen but it was selfdefense bro, but I won't kill the leader who will surely attempt to murder millions because that would make me the same as him"" dumb trope that makes no sense whatsoever, to the confusing mess with which it decided to defecate all over the show thus far.
99.9% of the show is a solid 9, the last 4 minutes is a solid 1 if not less, and feels like a slap in the face, so I'll give it a 6.5 to 7 at most.

While it could've been so great.. | Moon Knight has some great elements to it. It is a total tonal shift from the rest of the MCU that makes it a unique experience to watch. But like most MCU shows, there just isn't enough here. I really liked the majority of what was here the resolution felt rushed. All in all, still one of the better MCU shows that have been released.

**Verdict:** _Great_ | To tell you the story would be giving away too much of the little secrets and charms that make Moon Knight one of Marvel's and Disney+'s best new Superhero.

Oscar Issac plays Moon Knight an avatar of the Egyptian God Khonshu. His performance in this 6 episode series is so high quality that I wish the high ups would consider this man for an award of the highest caliber.

I could see Oscar Issac becoming the next big action star even bigger than Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones was/is. Oscar has a huge range and if you watch the series you will see how intense he can be from one scene to the next. Not only THST but previous movies have established him as a great villain and love interest.

Ethan Hawke as Harrow gave me a new respect for this seasoned brilliant actor. I've watched his career since it began and he absolutely floored me as Arthur Harrow.

So, I ain't giving anymore away because the little surprises and charms make this show a hell of a ride from start to finish.

Moon Knight is worth the watch. It might start slow but the build is MORE than worth it. | Did I just spend 282 minutes watching this because I love Moon Knight’s costume? Yes.

Do I regret it? Just a little. | _Moon Knight_ is like nothing Marvel’s done before—and I’m all in for the ride! The series throws out the traditional superhero playbook and gives us something gritty, weird, and seriously fun. If you thought _WandaVision_ was trippy, get ready, because _Moon Knight_ cranks up the surrealism even more. With a mashup of Egyptian mythology, action, and psychological horror, this show keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Oscar Isaac? Absolutely killing it. Watching him flip between the nervous, quirky Steven Grant and the hard-edged Marc Spector is a masterclass. One moment he’s fumbling through life with that British accent (which, yeah, feels a bit bonkers but endearing), and the next, he’s this tough mercenary wielding ancient powers. Isaac’s performance is the glue that holds everything together, especially when the pacing gets rocky. And let’s not forget that Isaac is technically juggling three characters. Yes, the third alter, Jake Lockley, makes a chilling appearance—teasing a darker layer to this already complex character.

The plot itself is simple on the surface—Steven and Marc’s tangled lives collide as they investigate Egyptian gods and a looming apocalyptic threat—but that’s where the simplicity ends. _Moon Knight_ thrives on chaos. Its unpolished, unpredictable narrative makes every episode feel like an adventure through Steven and Marc’s fractured minds. There are some wild tonal shifts, and sure, not all of them land perfectly, but that’s part of the charm. It’s gritty, it’s suspenseful, and there’s a raw energy here that you don’t see in every Marvel series.

Ethan Hawke as Arthur Harrow is a whole vibe. He brings this sinister, almost cult-leader energy that keeps you guessing. And May Calamawy? She holds her own as Layla, stepping into the spotlight as the Scarlet Scarab by the end of the season. Her action scenes and the dynamic between her and Marc/Steven elevate the show even further.

The pacing? Yeah, it can be a slow burn, especially early on. The show takes its time setting up Steven’s confusion before really diving into the action, and that might turn some people off. But trust me—stick with it. Once you’re through those first few episodes, _Moon Knight_ finds its groove. And while the show doesn’t fully escape the Orientalist undertones of the original comics, the direction from Mohamed Diab keeps the focus on character and chaos, giving us a visually stunning experience.

Speaking of visuals, the _Moon Knight_ suit is incredible, and the action sequences—especially those where Marc or Steven summons the suit—are sleek and satisfying. However, the creatures and gods sometimes feel underused, lurking more in the shadows than in full focus. But that eerie, horror-inspired edge works in the show’s favor, keeping things unpredictable.

At its core, _Moon Knight_ is a character study wrapped in mythological madness. It’s not trying to tie itself too tightly to the MCU, and that’s what makes it so refreshing. There’s a freedom here that lets the show explore mental health, trauma, and ancient power in ways Marvel hasn’t touched on before. Plus, the internal tug-of-war between Marc and Steven adds depth that keeps you emotionally invested.

Ultimately, _Moon Knight_ isn’t perfect, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s a chaotic, daring, and entertaining leap into new territory for the MCU. With Isaac’s powerhouse performance, strong supporting cast, and a story that’s just wild enough to work, this is one Marvel series you don’t want to miss.","Oscar Isaac, Ethan Hawke, May Calamawy, Ann Akinjirin, David Ganly",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

Pacing in latter half of the first season gets kind of slow though, and I was left wanting the story to be a bit more developed by the time it was wrapped up. Still, hoping / looking forward to the second installment. | ""The Three-Body Problem"" (2024) isn't just a science fiction film; it's a captivating journey into the vastness of space, the complexities of human nature, and the profound mysteries of the universe. This film, based on the acclaimed novel by Cixin Liu, stands as a towering achievement in the genre, surpassing any other space exploration film released in recent years.

As a space science enthusiast, I was utterly enthralled by the film's meticulous attention to scientific detail. While some scenes might initially seem confusing, they are grounded in solid scientific principles. The film masterfully weaves together concepts like the ""three-body problem"" in celestial mechanics, the challenges of interstellar travel, and the potential for alien life, creating a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.

The film's brilliance lies in its ability to explore the full spectrum of human nature. From the darkest depths of cruelty and ambition to the most profound acts of kindness and selflessness, ""The Three-Body Problem"" paints a realistic portrait of humanity's response to the extraordinary. The film's central conflict, a clash between Earth and an alien civilization, serves as a powerful metaphor for the challenges and opportunities that arise when different cultures and perspectives collide.

The film's narrative is a testament to the genius of Cixin Liu's original work. The concept of an alien civilization existing in a three-body system, facing constant chaos and instability, is both scientifically fascinating and deeply philosophical. The film masterfully translates this concept onto the screen, creating a world that is both alien and strangely familiar.

The film's exploration of physics is particularly noteworthy. It delves into complex concepts like dark matter and the nature of time, making them accessible to a wider audience. While some viewers might find these concepts challenging, the film's visual storytelling and clear explanations make them engaging and thought-provoking.

""The Three-Body Problem"" is a rare gem in the world of science fiction. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, prompting you to ponder the universe's mysteries and our place within it. It's a must-watch for anyone who seeks a cinematic experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally profound. This film is a testament to the power of science fiction to inspire, challenge, and ultimately, connect us to the vastness of the cosmos. | Good storyline.

first love,"First Love is an American soap opera which ran on NBC Daytime from July 5, 1954 to December 30, 1955. The series aired at 4:15 p.m. EST, between Golden Windows and Concerning Miss Marlowe. Although the show had a strong fan following, at the time NBC had little use for developing any of their daytime shows and canceled First Love after a year and a half. Many cast members such as Patricia Barry, Val Dufour and Rosemary Prinz went on to become long-running daytime stars.

Created by Adrian Samish and written by Manya Starr, the series centered around jet engineer Zach James and his difficult marriage to Laurie James. Due to being neglected as a child, Zach was obsessed with building a name for himself. Laurie tried to understand him but was unable to help him deal with his problems, as he went on trial for the murder of an aviatrix he may have been having an affair with.

The show became known chiefly for a major blooper early in its run. A Friday cliffhanger involved Zach seeing his friend Chris crash his plane. Zach ran to tell Chris' wife Amy, ""Chris cracked up the plane."" In his rush, Dufour blurted out, ""Chris crapped"", then abruptly added, ""...on the plane."" Patricia Barry began to giggle. When the camera cut to a ""bereaved"" Prinz, she was shaking with laughter. Supposedly NBC nearly fired all three actors, but changed their minds after fans wrote in praising them for the scene. In 2003 Prinz denied such a scene ever made it to the air.",Soap,5.0,4.326976291408619,0.0,False,Ended,0.6931471805599453,5.3706380281276624,2.70805020110221,No platforms available,No reviews,"Rosemary Prinz, Frankie Thomas, Paul McGrath, Val Dufour, Tod Andrews",0.0,False,0.0,1954.0

I liked the Simpsons and I loved Futurama... but honestly I don't think this offers anything knew.

It's not trying to be either show, or recapture any former glory, so I'll give it that. And it does have it's moments here and there, but it doesn't feel as if it's trying to say anything.

It's not exactly ripping into pop culture like the Simpsons did so brilliantly when it was so good, and it's not a social commentary channeled through the lens of Sci-fi geekdom like Futurama... it's not even ripping into pop culture or giving any social commentary as channeled through the lens of fantasy.

It's just kind of there, kind of episodic, kind of meh. It's not even the kind of meh where you can say that you don't like the character, or the situation, or whatever... because that would have just a tad more meaning than this offers.

Really it's kind of fun, but kind of empty and meaningless. The jokes aren't layer upon layer, they only come up when offered. It's almost like it was phoned in, and in a way that tries to tell an over-arching story about really nothing all that fun or different. | Disenchanted with Disenchantment. 

Started off well enough but what i can only assume is the last season, ended on a sour note for me. Putting aside all the usual woke trappings I've come to associate with Netflix, was a brief but nasty poke, at people who have concerns around what appears to be the COVID vaccines. 

In my country, like many others, people were coerced into taking experimental vaccines with threats of job loss. Moreover, increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that those concerned about the efficacy and safety of these products, may well have every reason to be so. Still an on going consideration, not one to be tritely dismissed. 

Beyond this, season fives story was alright but it did feel like the ideas were running thin and the net result was basic and in itself, not overly inspiring.Nor for that matter was it genuinely funny. Instead, leaning on childlike humour about things like ""bum bums"". Really?

In summary, I feel this series should really have ended at least a season ago. Its sparkle is well and truly, gone. Add to that its playing politics,  wokeness, suffice to say I found  it an unappealing proposition. I can not envisage another season. If there is one, I wont be watching it.","Abbi Jacobson, Lucy Montgomery, Nat Faxon, Tress MacNeille, David Herman",0.0,False,0.0,2018.0

There are many creepy moments and nifty ghosts. Some episodes are oozing with dread and horror. It's twisty, as all new shows seem to be and the twists are rather satisfying. However, there are moments when things get a little convoluted, a bit nonsensical and far too wordy. Some conversations go on way too long, hammering the point home until you want to punch a ghost right in the face. This happens towards the end and may leave you feeling sorta let down. But then you think back to the great moments and it makes up for the somewhat slow, syrupy, fizzling conclusion. The mansion is fantastic and the acting is quite good. Lots of characters in two versions, present and past, give it a fun vibe. 8/10 stars. | Is the house really haunted or is everyone slowly just losing their minds? Not a stereotypical horror. In fact the scares could be quite few and far between but the characters continued to drive the story forward.

For 8.2% I was expecting something almost masterpiece, Godlike good TV-show, but it's not even close.

The animation company is very well known and has good quality.  I believe they are very similar in what was used to make _Gargoyles_ tv animated series.  
There is a character for each of the classes, and fortunately each character _is_ a character unto themselves.  They are very different and fuse into what a good team of friends could be if they found themselves born to such a world.  There is enough gore to go around, and the writers did well with the comedy and gore alike.  The story for this title's pilot is a solid 8 out of 10.  The rich kid's mission for revenge against a sinisterly evil and neigh OP bad guy is epically done well, and is NOT something that is expected coming out of a Netflix streaming show.  Okay, enough about the pros.

The Cons:  And ofcourse when talking about **_anything_** from Netflix there are the **glaring** cancerous influences of social politics infesting the show.  In most cases it's usually the narrative that is corrupted, but when that is not a possibility, SJWs settle for the background.  There are different races in areas where there should be no variety in the people.  There is the typical flamboyantly gay racial minority fat-guy who is a keystone in supplying or getting knowledge of important artifacts.  >exasperated sigh< Ofcourse one of the young men in the main party has to flirt with the fat-guy to bargain with him. Annnnd ofcourse fat-gay-minority guy is OP in his own right, because you have to balance out the implied insult that successful minority men of commerce are all ""flamers.""  And what adventure is not complete without toilet humor?  Because that's what you need as you eat dinner to watch a show.  >groans<

Another major gripe of mine is the over-compensation of rude language to qualify for the streaming rating.  When I say overcompensate, I mean the ""seinen"" aspect to the show is unbalanced.

  It's like how are you going to swear so much in a show, show SOOOO much blood and gore, then leave out the nudity??  And if there is nudity, why does it have to be tied to something gay?  Usually with Netflix, this means male gay.  And since the majority of the viewing audience is male, it becomes, ""Why did you even bother??""  It kills the nuance of the show, it's grittiness of the age.  Gay instances were _never_ mainstream even in that time.  Sure it went on, but no one gave it that kind of attention.  And if they did, no one mentioned it aloud, not without threat of loosing their head.  Even gay romance with women, from a guy's point of view, is a snooze-fest of epic proportions because with the social politics not wanting to ""degrade women..."", this little edict (no one asked for) neutralizes **_all_** sensuality (if there ever was any).  There is nothing to the show that makes you want to see _more_ of this show if that is supposed to the ""eye candy""!?!  _That's_ what we're getting?!?  I counted, you know.  There were two pairs of boobs in this entire 12 episode first season.  4 tits; one of those pair belonged to an ugly mutant.  Funny story, lackluster presentation.  That is not enough boobs to get me to put up with another season of non-existent nudity, covert or overt homosexuality, and excessively crude language.  You take out any two of these and you are left with a show not worth viewing. At best it's okay; at worst, it's annoying.  Again, it becomes, ""Why am I watching this???""

The studio would have done better to ex out all nudity or implied situations, modern swearing, and gore.  And just ran the show as an animated series.  Kids (should) out number adults when it comes to this kind of viewing genre, so the studio would have been better served in this regard.  And again this ""imbalance"" has caused some serious errors in judgement and showing; potentially hurting its Nielsen rating.  In other words, it could have been more with less, instead of trying to be something more and falling short.  There is enough story, plot, action and engaging characters to make this show good.  In fact, if I ignore the social political negatives (with a LOT of effort), the show is downright entertaining.  I simply don't want to have to put in a focused effort (should never have to) to ignore the SJW aspect _every time_ I watch the show.

Don't know about you, but I'm not holding any bated breath for next season.

Good Luck in your viewing.  --  Bob  -- | I'm at the end of Season 1. I'm intrigued enough to keep going but the series needs better writing. It's starts off well enough but it looses all stakes and tension.

Long monologues, short one-liners, red herrings, escaping enemies, and one-two many near-death experiences. That last one really hurts the series cause you never feel like any of the main characters are in danger, even when they're bleeding out and near-death.

Arcane (2021) was near perfection, Castlevania (2017) had some writing nonsense, Season 4 of The Dragon Prince (2018) killed the series for me and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (2022) is just trope-y garbage. Vox Machina (2022) sits somewhere between The Dragon Prince Season 3 and Edgerunners.

It's not only boring, but all the people are drawn quite ugly and look disgusting, especially compared to Batman TAS (which it tries to imitate in terms of visual style, but really poorly). 

I'm a huge fan of the '90s-'00s DCAU and was expecting something at least a little bit similar, considering the fact that Bruce Timm is involved, but it seems that I was extremely wrong. | Animation, the key word there is Animation, as in animated, as in movement... which this doesn't seem to have. It's like all the characters are playing a game of statue. It looked good, but nothing moved.  

And that was my only complaint, it was only a small complaint.... but....then... a female body positive trans Penguin? That's where they lost me.  

Could the rest of it be good? Maybe... maybe not, but I'm sick to death of all the forced messaging. So they lost me because of it.

Sorry, but there is SOOO much content, there are so many TV shows, so many movies made before the forced woke politics that I couldn't watch it all... so I don't need to watch Batman: Caped Crusader.  I can watch something else, something without the forced messaging.

I don't need to watch anything that pushes that crap... but they need me, their industry is failing. 

I gave it a shot, and they lost me immediately when they forced their politics on the Penguin.  I unapologetically walked away and I will just stay away. | First, why is this even a thing we need in 2024? Did DC look at Marvel's X-Men '97 and decide ""Whoa, Nelly! We need to jump on this train and we need to do it now!""

Second, Pingwing isn't transgender, she's gender-swapped. At least get your outrage correct. The transphobia just never ends, does it? ""[...] a female body positive trans Penguin"" that's a lot of words. Would we have gotten the same stellar criticism for the regular ole body positive male Pingwing?

Third, this is the fourth series I'm reviewing in about as many days and they've all been boring. What is going on? Can I find something not boring to watch, please?

The writing is bad, the voice acting isn't great and the animation is ""meh"".

kolchak: the night stalker,"Kolchak: The Night Stalker is an American television series that aired on ABC during the 1974–1975 season. It featured a fictional Chicago newspaper reporter who investigated mysterious crimes with unlikely causes, particularly those that law enforcement authorities would not follow up. These often involved the supernatural or even science fiction, including fantastic creatures.","Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi & Fantasy",7.6,4.2917873262418995,4.382026634673881,False,Ended,0.0,2.995732273553991,3.9318256327243257,"Peacock Premium, Peacock Premium Plus","The influential Kolchak TV series from 1974-1975

The TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker ran for one season in 1974-1975, consisting of 20 episodes. Two additional episodes were scheduled to be filmed, but star Darren McGavin was becoming disillusioned with due to an exhausting schedule and the fact that he was rewriting scripts plus doing much of the production work without compensation.  The ratings were mediocre so he asked to be released from his contract with two episodes yet to be shot. The network granted his request in light of the ratings. I wish Darren would’ve persevered and finished out the season because then we’d have two more episodes to enjoy. He was too fatigued at the time to see that this unique and groundbreaking series would be his most well-known role, along with “A Christmas Story” (1983).

If you haven’t seen the two pilot movies, “The Night Stalker” (1972) and “The Night Strangler” (1973), I encourage you to view them before checking out the series. The debut movie was the best of the batch with “The Night Strangler” almost as good and even better in some ways (see my reviews for details). Both movies established the template (formula) for the TV series and myriad books that followed.

The 20 episodes are more of the same, but condensed into 51 minutes and all-around inferior. They’re all of about the same quality with favorites emerging depending on how interesting the Monster-of-the-Week is, as well as the guest stars, both of which are a matter of taste. The first episode, “The Ripper,” is a quality beginning for the series but it’s too much like the two pilot movies for its own good, particularly the first film. It’s basically a compressed version with a slightly different ‘monster.’ 

“Horror in the Heights” is usually cited as the best segment because of the intriguing monster, which can mimic a person its victim trusts. It’s actually pretty chilling for mid-70’s television. “The Trevi Collection” is one of my personal favorites because it deviates from formula and contains a twist. The story tackles witchcraft but doesn’t make the mistake of doing it in a one-dimensional manner (e.g. the mannequins). “The Energy Eater” is another fave due to guest stars William Smith, who beams with charisma, and professional-but-sultry Elaine Giftos, both of whom sorta team-up with Kolchak, particularly the former. 

“The Vampire” is distinguished for its ties to the pilot movie and taking place in Los Angeles rather than Chicago, not to mention its vicious no-talking (and sharp) antagonist. “Demon in Lace” is one of the better episodes due to the intriguing succubus and the campus locale. “The Zombie” is notable for its formidable foe and one of the creepiest sequences in the last act at a junkyard. The monster make-up in “The Werewolf” is lame, but I favor the episode because it takes place completely on a cruise ship and features voluptuous & perky Jackie Russell as Wendy (in a black bikini); and Nita Talbot as Paula, who becomes Kolchak's gal pal. 

The low points, for me, are the clunky “The Knightly Murders” (no pun intended), and “The Chopper,” which devolves into camp. Yet even those episodes have their points of charm. The final segment, “The Sentry,” is often reviled due to the reptilian creature costume, but it would’ve worked if the creators kept its cartoonish face & teeth obscured. The story rips-off Star Trek’s “Devil in the Dark,” but isn’t anywhere near as absorbing. Yet this is partially made up for by the beaming & lovely Kathie Browne as Lt. Irene Lamont. Kathie was McGavin’s wife for 34 years until her death in 2003. You might recall her as hottie Deela in Star Trek’s “Wink of an Eye” from seven years earlier. Unsurprisingly, she & Darren have great chemistry.

The concept of the show, and its star (and some of the co/guest stars), are better than the actual execution of most of the episodes. The show needed someone of the caliber of Gene Roddenberry at the helm. As it turned out, the bulk of the pressure & work fell on McGavin’s shoulders and thus he couldn’t even finish out the season. Nevertheless, the show was seminal and acquired a cult-following, influencing more popular future series like The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural and The Walking Dead.   

GRADE: B- | This could have been a witty show instead of a depressing one that borders too much on Hitler worship.
Kolchak is an obnoxious reporter and terrible role model. He does anything for a story.
Trouble is, the writing for the series seems to always degenerate into some Nazi ideology where all the murder victims are women with dark hair and dark eyes. It's impossible not to notice this worship of Hitler's genocide program. You feel like you're watching the reels of Nazis taking beautiful brunettes out to be executed.
That's the weakest part of the series, and it's impossible not to notice. It appears either the writer or director was jilted by too many brunettes in his life and couldn't get over it.
Simon Oakland almost salvages this series with his matter of fact character who has the sanity that Darren McGavin's Kolchak totally lacks. But it isn't enough to save the poor writing.","Darren McGavin, Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage",0.0,False,0.0,1974.0

A lot.  
Never have I seen the liberal agenda operate so consistantly seemless since the Little Mermaid's release date.  The amount of social inconsistances portrayed under the guise of this being fictional animation is astounding!  

You know what this reminds me of when I see an agenda played out in this manner?  It reminds of reading books that are the source material as opposed to seeing the book made into a movie for the big screen.  There is sooooo much more shock n' awe in the books than you'll ever get from the movie.  But here in this animation they (the liberal studio) took that concept and ran with it!!  Bravo. 

Here you have a coming of age boy, who is (stifled sniggering) the step-son to the _>hissing laughter through teeth<_ the king!! _>guffawing laughter<_  Yeah!!  That's right, the KING married to, interracially mind you, _>leg raising laughter<_ a single-mother!!! _>farting laughter, eyes flooded with tears, stomping one foot, gut-clenching laughter<_   

No wait!! It gets better!!  The co-lead is another ""boy"" with horns who is supposed to be a girl of exceptional theiving & assassination skills.  Of course she can out-do the boy (MC) on every physical level; he's--I mean, she's a wood-elf.  And they are beings of magic!  So, why not be better than him at everything??  I guess you're wondering what the whole ""he"" thing is about with white-hair horn-head super elf, huh?  Well, that's because the artists drew her in such a way that you can't tell, save for the voice, if the character is female or not. (Just mute the show while you watch it; you'll see what I mean.)  Because she certainly doesn't have any feminine qualities.  Naw!!  Can't have those pesky froo-froo girl traits getting in the way of her awesome-ness.  Perish the thought. lmao

I mean it was soooo long ago that one could just look at a character and know who was a girl and who was a boy.  Now, it's damn near sacrilegious, to draw boobs on a 15 year old girl, pouty lips, or any kind of feminine hairstyle.  
Oh you pervert you for being heterosexual!!  Ah, 2013, how we miss you so. >sighs< 
Let's not forget that if the show goes longer than 3 minutes without demostrating how bad-ass any woman can be, then the next 3 scenes you'll be punished with how EVIL & misguided men are.  And if they don't have those great traits, then you are privilaged with seeing how they are bumbling, dependent, clueless, indecisive dolts.  Oh, and gullible.  Can't forget gullible to an extreme.  But it's better than being a citizen of magic.

When you're born of the magic, there is 60% chance you are in a same sex relationship or pursuing a same sex relationship!  Exciting & daring is it not!!  To be a natural wielder of magic and natural wielder of same sex whoopi time!!  Not too many disappointed beings on the magic side of things, huh?  Of course if you are heterosexual then you'll have to use your imagination for all the good this animation will show you.  Same sex & hope = good.  Heterosexual = bad, strange, and unlikely.
And I know what you're going to say, ""But the lead boy and the elf girl kiss!!""  _[stares at you like you're the village idiot]_  You mean, the white-haired ""dude"" with a girl's voice?  Yeaaaaah, that romance was about as force as a wrong puzzle piece pounded into place.  How?  Well, she's bad-ass, but suddenly at the end of the show she needs him to rescue her!?  Really??  That one time, the _only_ time, he rescues her once, after she's been incredibly capable the entire, however many episodes, there at the end...she needs saving?   Like I said, forced.

The animation is fine (except for the fact if both the leads were mute **you would not be able to tell** which was the female). And the story flows well enough.  But there are too many checkboxes for me to enjoy this--And I'm black!!
List of Inconsistances shoe-horned in because this is ""Fantasy"" are as follows :

* Interracial marriage.
* Royal Interracial marriage to a single mother
* Homosexual Elves --though not sure how much of an inconsistancy-- Ah, it's bogus.  On account that elves are proud, and even prouder warriors.
* Same sex royal marriage
* Same sex royal marriage with kid?!!? --I can't even think that w/o a WTF face--
* Androgynous co-lead female
* Androgynous co-lead female that is more skilled than her homosexual male Captain.
* Handicap female leader of a military force
* Royal handicap female leader of a military force
* the fact that all royalty put themselves in harm's way to fight the most dangerous of magical foes -- the dragon king.  You mean to tell me, they had kingdoms but no loyal knights to fight for them??
* The misled evil white man's daughter with severe daddy issues of Approval that makes her a NOT-SO good person due to her personal choices to suck the life out of innocent beings to save her family.
* the dolt son to the evil white man, who is a good soul but not until he gets people killed or seriously injured
* Another female leader of the magic fairies, this one is for lava.  Annnnnd she's gayer than pink pineapple in the hands of Rupe Hall.  
* And last but certainly not least, the angry young guy who will not listen to reason because the evil white man framed the fairies for his father's murder!  Oh, I do believe HE is supposed to be Latino.  So I guess they were represented too!!  Yaaaaay!!

But this was just a list of all the things a ""normie"" would miss if they were not skilled (or 10yrs old, OR a housewife) in looking for a good well written story.  Like I said, the animation is good, but everything else about this ""animation"" is horridly forced, contrived, and painstakingly predictable.  

Who has two thumbs and gave this liberal visual sewage .5 stars??  This guy!!! | I'm writing this very short review based on memory in order to offset the ""ZOMG I SEE COMPETENT FEEEEMAILS ON SCREEN AND MY BRAIN IS MELTING!"" drivel that passes for reviews on this website.

Seasons 1 to 3 are good. It wasn't on the level of Arcane season 1 but it was good enough to earn my high rating and ""favorite"" star.

I cannot fully remember why but season 4 was so much trash it made me lose all interest in it. So much so that I didn't even notice season 5 released until literally the time of writing this.

I'll watch season 5 at some point and update this review. For now the high rating will remain, but The Dragon Prince reminds me of RWBY - it started off strong then dropped the ball so bad that I can't be bothered to keep up with it anymore. I see also that a season 6 is planned. I am neither excited nor dismayed.

Its star, Anya Taylor-Joy, is quickly becoming a favorite as well, delivering a great performance as Beth Harmon, a genius young chess player struggling with substance abuse and mental and emotional hurdles holding her back from her relationships and from true mastery of the game. She's charming, but also cool and calculated, reserved yet fun when she wants to be, and very beautiful and captivating as the lead in a big period drama like this. Her supporting cast carries their weight well, with lots of faces I've never seen, but many that I won't soon forget. The strange cowboy-esque New Yorker Benny Watts (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and the imposing chess veteran, Soviet world champion Vasily Borgov (Marcin Dorociński) were highlights, both huge parts of what makes the show work and give it some of its biggest emotional moments by the end.

Although chess is played on a tiny board and has intricacies far above the heads of most of the audience, careful editing in terms of pacing and commentary has elevated the game here into an exciting spectator sport, even for beginners. When Taylor-Joy's Beth sits across from the champion Borgov for their various matchups, I felt like I was sitting down to watch the NBA Finals or the Super Bowl. The show does a great job building up its climactic matches by laying out the emotional stakes and showing all the nights of hard work, all the mistakes, all the surprises and reversals, zoomed in at the exact right times to drive it home. It really inspires you to want to learn more about this complex game.

Lastly, I want to draw attention to the setting, not only the beautiful execution of the mid-century time period, but the many locales featured throughout. Although the show starts in small town Kentucky, it quickly escalates as Beth rises from regional tournaments to international ones, and it really gives the show this great feeling of progression as the hotels and dining get more lavish and the characters navigate new waters. With the exception of the section set in the USSR, which I think is perfect, sure, maybe they could have gotten more out of these locations. But I still think they all color their respective episode really well and are exciting to see. This globetrotting focus is balanced well with Beth's time at home in Kentucky and keeps the show dynamic. 

I hope more people watch this fantastic show. It's #1 on Netflix right now so looks like they are. I really think it benefits from the miniseries format over being a standard long-form TV drama, getting out just what it needs to with no time to become stale, and no risk of an unresolved cliffhanger ending. Can't wait to see what these people make next! | I was loving this (pretty much) right up until the last episode when a woke deus ex machina suddenly appears in a Corvair to save the day. The cinematography is nice and the story of triumph rolls right along sans all the normal impediments one might expect. The adoptive mother goes right along with our heroes desire to be a chess champ. I never expected that to be so easy for her, and it was a little too convenient that the father left town and never returned.

There ARE a few other implausibilities that annoyed me, like the fact that an 8 year old would become addicted to tranquilizers to the degree that Beth did. Was her mother an addict? That was never even hinted at. People generally don’t develop severe addictions on their own without at least some genetic motivation and you can’t have something that big happen in a film story without explaining it. 

And what about all the free time she was allowed playing chess in the basement of the orphanage with the custodian. Also, I’m not sure how ALL the dancing came into it, because young Beth never danced around alone in her room. 

And, another thing I don’t fully understand is Beth’s desire to be a chess champion. Sure, she loves playing, but where did the inherent need to be the best chess player on Earth come from? That was never explained at all and I expected it to maybe be motivated by a need to make money since the adoptive father abounded her and the mother, but nope, that didn’t even happen. 

When a character is driven to do something, it’s generally because of some deep seated need or dire circumstance, but in this film we never see that need. It’s just there, and that’s lazy writing.","Anya Taylor-Joy, Chloe Pirrie",0.0,False,0.0,2020.0

Based, very loosely, on the early life of Mary, Queen of Scots (Adelaide Kane) at the court of King Henry II, where she has been betrothed since an infant to the Dauphin (Toby Regbo). The series uses a considerable degree of cinematic licence as we follow her well documented trials and tribulations as she navigates the conspiracies of the French court; but it does it without any soul - or passion. It needn't have been an HBO romp-along; but there are just way too many 'pretty' actors delivering pedestrian scripts; set-piece plots and mysteries. Even when things do get a touch romantic (they never get raunchy) we take comfort in a folk-style soundtrack and some lovely shots of what are, admittedly, some fine locations. Follows makes sure that there are plenty of conspiracies to keep up her end of the bargain, but Regbo and the gorgeous, but totally pointless character of ""Bash"" (Torrance Coombs) seem there to add looks but little else to this really mediocre telling of what must have been an extremely eventful few years in peril and love for such an enigmatic Queen.","Adelaide Kane, Megan Follows, Celina Sinden, Craig Parker, Jonathan Goad",0.0,False,0.0,2013.0

The main characters are so boldly drawn and some of the action and plots so fantastical that the viewer would be forgiven for continually thinking...satire. Yet, the series stays true to a ""real life"" plot which it wants you to take seriously. Jodie Comer does a fantastic job of getting us into the mind of this off kilter psychopathic killer. Eventually, I think we do understand Villanelle who turns out to be the show's real protagonist. I'm not sure if Sandra Oh choice as Eve Polastri was a genius casting decision or an epic mistake. Either way, she did an excellent job as first a foil then a lost soul. The others, as I said before, seemed properly over the top in the espionage or police and crime genre to be recognizable yet also unique. I give great credit also some inspirational writing which created many brilliant individual vignettes and memorable exchanges. Yes, I knew these characters were not 'real' but I just loved to hear them talk. Something refreshing and surprising. | Really rough.

One is the woman at the hospice and the other is the nun, not so much the nun, but the fact that she is being given all these details about an ongoing serial murder case, on a whim.

Then there's the other issue, that our lead protagonist never seems phased by what she sees but literally everyone else is disturbed to the point of barfing everywhere.

I find when Ryan Murphy tries to play with his formula he mostly fumbles it.
Niecy Betts is an excellent lead and it's good to see her with the space to round a character out - she's truly really good in this and backed by a strong supporting cast, Goodwin and Diamond in particular.

I enjoy camp, but about half way through the season there's an absolutely senseless, anachronistic and frankly painful musical number, that had me absolutely cringe - I felt embarrassed for the cast members involved.  To follow this up, Murphy tries to flip the script and introduce a clumsy twist - is it a dream?  Jesus, really?  Half way through the season?  Ok, if you're going to start the series with this kind of premise, but introducing it after stakes and investment are built?  Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.

The creators did an exceptional job of capturing the essence of the original 90s characters. However, there is one notable drawback in the form of voice casting. Some voices, like those of characters Rogue and Wolverine, are difficult to listen to. Despite this flaw, the overall voice work for other characters is commendable, making the show enjoyable.

After completing the series and reflecting on my initial review, I have decided to revise my rating from 4 1/2 stars to 3 1/2 stars. While the show excels in nostalgia and character creativity, there are certain aspects that detract from the overall experience. The introduction of Cable as the son of Scott and Jean, a plot point I disliked from the comics, was disappointing. The portrayal of Cable as a sassy and somewhat entitled character felt like a departure from the original concept, which was disheartening.

While I appreciate inclusivity in storytelling, it felt forced at times in the series. The constant emphasis on representation, such as with Morph's non-binary character, seemed overwhelming, especially in a cartoon aimed at a younger audience. While I am supportive of diversity, I believe it should be integrated thoughtfully and not overshadow the narrative.

In conclusion, despite my reservations about certain aspects of the show, I still recommend giving it a watch. X-Men has always been a favorite superhero franchise of mine, and the series has its merits. It may not be perfect, but it is worth exploring for fans of the X-Men universe.",,0.0,False,0.0,2024.0

The fact is tales of alternate reality have been done to death, so much so, that the whole premise now looks a lot like a cliche. Dark Matter has an instant issue, with this reviewer, for this very reason.

There have been series that have pulled it off beautifully, like German series Dark. It worked because there was enough complexity and depth in the alternate reality story, not to mention it played wonderfully with paradoxes.

By contrast, Dark Matter feels simplistic and predictable. It was obvious within a few frames who the masked attacker is and what comes after doesn't really improve greatly on this observation. Indeed, its largely unsubtle in its handling, which does little to draw you in or have you asking questions as Dark did.

Acting is reasonable, its a solid cast and whilst production values are high, this one just doesn't resonate with me after two, rather pedestrian, episodes.

In summary, the simplistic and predictable, lets call it ""safe"" handling doesn't put this series in the same class, as imaginative risk takers, like Dark. If you have't seen this kind of series before you may still enjoy Dark Matter, I have no doubt. That said, for the more seasoned and jaded science fiction viewers amongst us, its not an alternative reality, its just more of the same. | Dark Matter (2024) is a dismal misfire that fails on nearly every front. From the outset, it becomes painfully clear that “nothing matters” in this convoluted mess of amateur sci-fi soap opera and tedious family drama. The series boasts poor editing, with jarring cuts and pacing issues that make its already thin narrative feel even more disjointed. The characters are lifeless, reduced to cardboard archetypes who make inexplicably stupid decisions at every turn.
The supposed high-concept premise quickly devolves into unintentional comedy, weighed down by endless, repetitive family details that sap any potential for intrigue or suspense. Rather than offering compelling stakes, the show drags viewers through a nonsensical plot that fails to make its point—if it even had one. Any attempts at drama come off as ridiculous, leaving viewers more frustrated than entertained.
With no sense of direction or payoff, Dark Matter collapses into a black hole of mediocrity. It’s a waste of time, energy, and life—an experience devoid of entertainment or enlightenment. What could have been an engaging exploration of cosmic and existential themes instead becomes a tragic reminder of how not to make television. Avoid this series at all costs.","Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Connelly, Alice Braga, Jimmi Simpson, Dayo Okeniyi",0.0,False,0.0,2024.0

SEASON 01:

It has been twenty years since the revolution of 3D animation. The feature films are on the another level, but I always wondered why the television series are lagging behind on this. A few of them from the recent were not that impressive as this one. This surely would become a classic as the years to come. But don't judge it as it is only for children. That's what I surprised with. I should have seen it six months ago when it came. I was not discarding, but delaying my watch and now I regret that kind of mindset of mine.

Based on the book of the same name, co-written by Guillermo del Toro. One of the final works of Anton Yelchin before his unexpected death in the last year. I do not have to check for that, once I have heard the voice, I knew right away it was him. A very unique voice tone as only a very few in the film industry gifted with. He has done many good works, but this is the one to remember as his final.

The series had won three Annie Awards out of four nominees and several others. Really a great achievement in animation, the product that made for television. Definitely many 3D animated series would follow the same route. Especially I am expecting from the Disney as I am a big fan of it, despite their two famous films turned successfully into 2D animated series, which I liked they're not letting go the dying art of the early days. That's me. I want everything!

> ❝Destiny is a gift. Some to their entire lives, living existence as a quiet desperation.❞

I am a film fanatic, not series', but I regularly watch them. So, normally I won't review television series, unless I loved it's all the episodes. Which means, usually the documentaries and history related series'. Probably this is the first time for an entertainment series and I'm happy for doing that. I just want to let others know how great it is, because it is not one of the most watched series, unlike the high rating and praised big.

The season one consists of 26 episodes, just like the old days. Because, nowadays the series episodes are reduced between 10-13. You might have heard that recently the writers are on the protest for losing their work. Anyway, each episode was so awesome. Like full story, with lots of twist and turns. It could have made a fantastic film series of around 10 to 12 films like the 'Harry Potter'. Yeah, even as a live-action film is not a bad idea, since todays technology was far better than ten years ago.

BUT I'm happy for it as it is as a series, that makes it very unique. The characters were totally unpredictable. There are like 10-15 major characters and as the series progress, you would witness a complete changeover in them. And that's I call a perfect character development. I mean there are no flashbacks, but all the needed infos were revealed to us quite stylishly like with the missions in each episode.

It is obviously about a chosen one. I have not seen a masterpiece like this on the chosen one concept since 'The Lord of the Rings'. There is no wasting of time, it all begins right away and when that happened, I said 'here it comes the boring part'. After watching the first episode, I felt it was not bad. Awesome in fact. Then I was not expecting the following episodes to follow the same magic, but they did. As I watched first 3-4 episodes, I came to realise its brilliance. That's it, since then there's nothing to stop me as I finished watching the entire first season as much as soon as I can.

> ❝Well, I wouldn't really call it an issue, an issue is something you can fix.❞

The disappointment came from not with the series, but after ending my watch, there were no more to continue. So I can't wait for the second season, which is due later this year. One of the reasons I loved the series is for each episode was better the previous one. It's only going up in the graph of impressing its viewers. If someone did not like an episode means, probably he's did not pay attention in his watch. Coming back to the story, I liked the details of everything. Easy to follow and the introduction of all the characters are nicely done.

So a teenager named Jim Lake from a town called Arcadia becomes the first human Trollhunter after the amulet chose him. Soon he was guided by the two trolls and he was taken to their world called Heartstone Trollmarket that lies underneath the Arcadia. With his not so fierce training and other small-small missions, Jim has to improve his efficiency in order to do what he has chosen for. He struggles, but the faith on him among the trolls gives all the needed strength. That's when he meets Bular, the son of Gunmar who is trying to rise from the darkness.

Meanwhile, he has to face other threats like from Changleings and Goblins. With the help of his friends he succeeds most of the time in defending Trollmarket. The story aimed in one direction, but that does not stay that way for very long. One of the best things about this series is changing the course in its narration. Like in the halfway of the season, the Trollhunter who was preparing for his cause, has to face the threats from a different angle as he's the protector of the Trolls. Which makes the plot to go another way, while you are starting to predict on the other way. My first appreciation is the screen-writing. Well done del Toro.

> ❝You humans cut stones unlock their beauty, but trolls cut stones unlock their power.❞

When I and my niece watched 'Miraculous Ladybug...', she was chanting 'Tikki spots on' without her conscious and now I'm doing the same after watching this. Surely it's not just me, anyone who loved it like I did would do the same. Yeah, 'for the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command' is not just a word, though it became a slogan. It had good action sequences. There are sentiments too. As the season approaches its finale, it gets very emotional. I liked several characters, but AAARRGGHH was the top in my chart, followed by Blinky his philosophical dialogues. But not all the time what he says concerns about our world. Most of them are funny and inspiring.

Those characters are the soul of this series, but I don't know how the following season would stay with the same intensity. I hope they sort it out. Claire Nunez surely reminds Marinette as someone pointed out that in Pinster. It might be a co-incident, but a very fact, just like I still confuse between Mark Walhberg and Matt Damon. Then there's Toby, one of the best sidekick ever. He was fun, but according to the situation his role turns, yet still he remains fun.

The villains are great. It's always very important to match the hero or overpower. There is no just one bad guy, but many and each of them were so unique. By far, as how far this season went on, Angor Rot was the best. His powers simply amazes, even though he's a negative role. The Gumar is yet to be revealed so I can't make judgement on him. But Angor Rot was like Darth Vader of this story.

This could be DreamWorks animation's game changing program. But like usual the praise also goes to Netflix for joining the hand with. I don't know what they would do for Anton Yelchin casting in the season two. Surely they'll come up with something. Finally, I end my review by saying don't miss it, especially if you have kids in the house, watch with them for more fun. I hope to return for the next season review.

_9.5/10_ | **It's time now for Gunmar to prepare to face the Trollhunters!**

**_SEASON 02:_**

I don't know how to begin, because I loved the first season. The review was one of the longest I've ever written for any title. But this follow up season did not stand up to that standard. It's still a nice show with nice animation and all, I enjoyed watching it, though lesser.

I don't know what made it fall slightly. Maybe the first season had awesome villains and adventures, which totally lacked in this. Angor Rot, Strickler, Nomura, NotEnrique, particularly Bular, the son of Gunmar was brilliant. If only half of these guys had returned in full scale, the fate of the season would have been different.

That's not a big deal if they had introduced similar, powerful villains. But the Gunmar looked so weaker than his son. Especially they were too much hyped about Gunmar previously. Now he's here and had nothing big role. So I'm anticipating his part would come in the next season. Looks that way that they're saving him for the finale.

Anyway, like I said, I liked it. If you had liked the first, you would like this as well. I'm happy they had only half the episodes compared to the first. Sweet and short. The third and final season would come at the end of this year, so I'm eagerly looking forward to know how it all ends. Besides, I've not read the book, but surely Del Toro won't disappoint us.

_7/10_ | I didn't think I would enjoy this, but I did!

It was viewed on TV time to time, but since I got Netflix I thought I would watch the whole thing. And you know what, the HD made it look amazing.
Featuring a great cast, and a great storyline from season to season, Trollhunters was a fantastic fantasy animation.

I think my fav highlight would be the series finale, especially when the late Anton Yelchin's voiceover was heard, from the start of the series of when he gave a speech about destiny.
It was a great show.","Lexi Medrano, Charlie Saxton, Amy Landecker, Kelsey Grammer, Fred Tatasciore",0.0,False,0.0,2016.0

Telling the story of the murder of Gianni Versace (Edgar Ramírez) at the hands of Andrew Cunanan (Darren Criss), what's especially interesting about this season of American Crime Story is the narrative structure. The opening scene of the first episode sees the murder, and the show then goes backwards, with each episode set earlier than the previous one, an achronological structure that unifies form and content; this isn't about a murder, it's about how Cunanan became a serial killer.

Within this, the show deals with two interrelated issues; 1) the concept that one must work hard to be successful, and 2) the desire to be remembered. Cunanan is obsessed with the second, but unwilling to acknowledge the first, despite his conviction of his own greatness. His attitude is nicely critiqued by Versace himself (""_Life isn't about convincing people you can do great things. It's about doing them_""), and the last shot masterfully encapsulates much of Cunanan's deepest existential fears. For all that, however, the season is good, but not great. The last two episodes are far and away the strongest, especially Jon Jon Briones's appearance as Modesto, Cunanan's detestable father, but, overall, it isn't a patch on _The People v. O.J. Simpson_.","Sarah Paulson, Beanie Feldstein, Annaleigh Ashford, Margo Martindale, Edie Falco",0.0,False,0.0,2016.0
aftermash,"AfterMASH is an American situation comedy that aired on CBS from September 26, 1983, to December 11, 1984. A spin-off of the series M*A*S*H, the show takes place immediately following the end of the Korean War and chronicles the adventures of three characters from the original series: Colonel Potter, Klinger and Father Mulcahy. M*A*S*H supporting cast-member Kellye Nakahara joined them, albeit off-camera, as the voice of the hospital's public address system. Rosalind Chao rounded out the starring cast as Soon-Lee Klinger, a Korean refugee whom Klinger met, fell in love with and married in the M*A*S*H series finale ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen.""

AfterMASH premiered in the fall of 1983 in the same Monday night 9:00 P.M. EST. time slot as its predecessor M*A*S*H. It finished 10th out of all network shows for the 1983-1984 season according to Nielsen Media Research television ratings. For its second season CBS moved the show to Tuesday nights at 8:00 EST., opposite NBC's top ten hit The A-Team, and launched a marketing campaign featuring illustrations by Sanford Kossin of Max Klinger in a nurse's uniform, shaving off Mr. T's signature mohawk, theorizing that AfterMASH would take a large portion of The A-Team's audience. The theory, however, was proven wrong. In fact, the exact opposite occurred, as AfterMASH's ratings plummeted to near the bottom of the television rankings and the show was canceled nine episodes into its second season, while The A-Team continued until 1987, with 97 episodes.",Comedy,5.1,4.24573429127292,2.1972245773362196,False,Ended,0.6931471805599453,3.4339872044851463,3.4011973816621555,No platforms available,No reviews,"Harry Morgan, Jamie Farr, William Christopher, Rosalind Chao, Peter Michael Goetz",1.0,False,0.0,1983.0

After watching the last episode of the season, I had this tingly feeling in my back of deja vu, and I spent a good fifteen minutes trying to find the source- which I found in the show “You”. Both shows depict this character trying to wash away their murderous tendencies and have a quote-unquote normal life, but failing at that at every turn. Barry, however, is significantly more… wholesome. There’s no stalking, he develops real connections with people, and at the heart of it, the show is a comedy. (It’s easy to tell Bill Harder came from comedy backgrounds)

Not only that but the cinematography is absolutely supreme. I came into the show knowing Bill Harder had studied film but it’s so evident- ESPECIALLY with the cold opens and the scenes where Barry’s PTSD are shown.

Anyways, 10/10. Watch it, I’m begging you. It’s so funny, it’s so emotional, and it’s just a perfect show.","Bill Hader, Sarah Goldberg, Anthony Carrigan, Henry Winkler, Stephen Root",1.0,True,6.0,2018.0

So the message of Andor is it's ok to commit murder as long as it for the benefit of the cause. So the ends justify the means. Great Messaging Disney. That is not what Star Wars is about. | Probably the best disney star wars show to release since the mandalorian. | If you liked 'Rogue One', you'll likely enjoy this prequel (set five years before Rogue One).
Some familiar people, places and creatures, but also some unfamiliar ones.
I personally love the flashbacks to Cassian's childhood. It helps to flesh out his character and explain how he became the person that he did.
It's gritty and realistic with great cinematography.
Some might say it's slow, but do yourself a favour and watch the first three episodes in close succession... as they really do fit together as a movie length introduction to the series. | Great show so far, I do have problems with the Rebel's morals but I am enjoying so far! | The one and only Star Wars TV/movie story that is actually good and not just a visual spectacle. Yeah, I said that. Don't fight me though. 

I have only ever watched Star Wars shows and movies for the visuals and fight scenes. Never have I actually been captured by the stories.

But Andor... it's just on a whole different level. Well done to the writers here. Some of the best non-movie visuals ever as well! | ""Star Wars: Andor"" takes a different approach to the galaxy far, far away. It's not about lightsaber duels or epic space battles, but rather the gritty reality of rebellion. This series delves into the everyday struggles of people fighting for a cause, and it does so with a refreshing realism that resonated with me deeply.

As a Star Wars fan, I've always been drawn to the core philosophy of the franchise – the constant struggle between good and evil, the reminder that life is about making choices and aligning yourself with one side or the other. ""Andor"" embraces this theme, but instead of showcasing grand battles and heroic deeds, it examines the everyday compromises and sacrifices that fuel a rebellion.

Cassian Andor, the series protagonist, is a welcome change from the typical Star Wars hero. He's not a Jedi with supernatural powers or a charismatic pilot with a knack for the Force. He's a man driven by personal loss and a deep sense of injustice, forced to make hard choices in a brutal, unforgiving world. He's flawed, relatable, and his Latin background adds a distinct layer of cultural richness to the story.

""Andor"" doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of the Star Wars universe. It explores the bureaucratic machinery of the Empire, the moral compromises people make to survive, and the devastating consequences of war on ordinary citizens. This level of detail and realism gave the series a powerful sense of immediacy, making me feel like I was truly a part of this world.

While I appreciate the epic scale and grand adventures of the Skywalker saga, ""Andor"" offered something different. It provided a nuanced and complex exploration of the political and social forces that shape the Star Wars galaxy. It gave me a deeper understanding of the sacrifices made by the rebels, the price of freedom, and the enduring power of hope in the face of tyranny.

If you're looking for a Star Wars story that goes beyond the lightsaber battles and focuses on the human cost of rebellion, ""Andor"" is a must-watch. It's a compelling and thought-provoking series that reminds us that the fight for freedom is a complex and often messy struggle.","Diego Luna, Stellan Skarsgård, Kyle Soller, Denise Gough, Adria Arjona",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

As his star began to rise above the Hollywood sign, he created AMAZING STORIES, an anthology series not unlike THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  Not surprisingly, this new project debuts just a couple of years after his involvement in the doomed TWILIGHT ZONE movie.  The filmmaker would fluctuate his involvement in the series from directing a couple of episodes to story suggestions and plot ideas. No matter what, his influence is felt throughout the run.

The opportunity to work with Spielberg shook the walls of the movie factory.  Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Brad Bird and Robert Zemeckis are just a handful of directors who helmed an episode. Kevin Costner, Carrie Fisher, Kiefer Sutherland, Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito appeared in the series amongst another list of hundreds of A-list performers.  John Lithgow took home an Emmy award for his performance in the touching episode THE DOLL.

Since the series is so diverse, each episode should be reviewed on its own merit, as if each was its own unique film.  These reviews would no doubt vary from excellent to weak.  Not surprising from a series that's budgets from complicated war scenes to shots in limited detail studios.

union pacific,"Union Pacific is a Western television series starring Jeff Morrow, Judson Pratt and Susan Cummings that aired in syndication from 1958 until 1959. This show was inspired by the 1939 film also named Union Pacific, starring Joel McCrea, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Preston.

The series follows the exploits of Bart McClelland, played by Morrow, as he supervises the construction and extension of the Union Pacific Railroad west of Omaha, Nebraska, to Promontory, northwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. McClelland was mostly concerned with right-of-way issues, which could be affected by stubborn landowners, ranchers, Indians, outlaws, and other factors. Helping McClelland with his work was surveyor Billy Kincaid, played by Pratt. Susan Cummings rounded out the cast as Georgia, proprietor of the Golden Nugget Saloon, the rolling bar that followed the railroad workers along the tracks.

Hollywood adds more diversity characters for diversity sake.
As if cop shows in general are not inaccurate enough _(at least they try to look realistic from proper appearance, fake legal jargon, well acted fight scenes, etc)_, let's take an uprofessional but seemingly ""think-outside-the-box"" type of character of a Female FBI agent from a good series _(yeah because we must have minorities in everything. Not that it's a problem necessarily)_ and make her even less professional (in appearance, roles, behaviour, etc) and remove the unique thinking aspect but then even hypersexualise her appearance more _(appreciate the irony of female empowerment supposedly criticising the idea of women being valued for traits outside their looks, while forcefully focusing on looks over other traits in supposed empowered female character)_. Then degrade all other supporting characters. 
At this point, it's suggestable to just ditch new Hollywood shows all together. | Well you know it's woke because Strong Black Female Lead (SBFL) walks around spouting off woke talking points in a way that's only a little removed from a speech...

... while being the bestest ever and putting evil men in their place easily and by that I mean that I mean she does it all without breaking a sweat while showing up the more experienced agents 

And while SBFL is doing all that everyone around her just talks about how beatiest she is, never missing an opportunity to praise her as the bestest of the bestest while pointing out her diversity in the few moments she fails to.

But given everything that's coming out about the FBI in the news, having am ultra woke Fed is pretty realistic, the only thing that seems out there is the fact that the FBI actually takes on crime instead of parents and political enemies of the left.

At the end of the day though, you've seen this before, it's like all the other shows exactly like it that put politics over plot | This is a spin-off series from 'The Rookie'.
The central character in this series was introduced mid-way through season 2 of the Rookie... and we get a lot of backstory on her and why she joined the FBI.

Both 'The Rookie' and The Rookie: Feds' are excellent entertainment. They are not even slightly realistic in the way, either the LAPD or The FBI would be run or their processes... but that isn't the point. They are TV show and very entertaining, with great story lines, humour, drama and twists.

Thankfully, they have renewed The Rookie for a Season 4. I hope we don't need to wait too long for it.

What's the future for The Rookie: Feds?... dunno and don't really care. I'll watch it if it is renewed, but wouldn't Miss it if it isn't. I would miss The Rookie!!","Niecy Nash-Betts, Felix Solis, James Lesure, Britt Robertson, Kevin Zegers",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

Marlo Thomas does a fantastic job in this, IMHO. ESPECIALLY when you watch the DVD extras and see where it was her idea to make Anne Marie a ""modern, working woman"". The original ideas pitched had her playing a ""Lucy meets Donna Reed"" character. I'm glad she changed the producers' and writers' minds! Yes, it's a silly show, but remember that Batman came out the same year and was even more silly...

Unfortunately, like Star Trek Discovery and the Star Wars sequel trilogy, the show kind of takes everything that is canonical and completely ignores it...which is a trope for a lot of Science Fiction these days...and one that instantly alienates the fans that invested a lot of time, money, and love into the universe.

The pilot is a great sell to keep a new viewer.

However, as it keeps going, even before the end of first season, the show turns into a boring repetitive plot or a dragged story-line with deliberately inserted over-sexualised/slutty characters probably to hook simple-minded male viewers.

The reason it deserves some credit is that it's well done enough to be a great alternative to Marvel's new competing shows with annoyingly preachy writing.  
Also, the graphic effects are moderately done.  
It's nice to have a competitor to Marvel.

Well this falls in that same category as the series seems to again forget what made Marvel films great which was an interesting hero that does not preach and just is just plain fun and interesting to watch and not always the bestest evar hero, but actually has some character arch. Unfortunately Disney has decided not to hire quality writers for this series again as they have already said that they have no idea how to write for a law series, yet they are making a law based comedy (not sure what they have written counts as comedy) series with no knowledge how to write one - and yep that shows in the story. 

The series looks like it has improved the CGI from the trailers, but not by much as still looks rather cheap, especially with our the character, She-Hulk.

The main bright spot of this series is Tatiana Maslany, who is pretty charming and a great actor but unfortunately can not overcome the grim writing and terrible ""jokes"" that weight this series down.

Disney keeps making trash for their streaming platform, so keep yourself from getting angry and 'hulking' out, and avoid this series, try watching a much better written show that wants to entertain like these animated series, Solar Opposites (Disney+/Hulu) or Invincible (Prime). If you are looking for a quality live action Superhero show, then watch The Suicide Squad and then the associated Peacemaker show - both fun and entertaining with quality writing.

If you still want to check out She-Hulk then search out the John Byrne written comic (can probably be found today in either a digital format/platform or in a graphic novel) from the 80's - great progressive story and fantastic artwork makes the Disney+ series look embarrassing compared to the comic - this is what they should have heavily borrowed from to make the TV show shine. | _She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_ at times is some of the better MCU Disney+ content that has come out, but at other times is some of the most bland and boring. Uneven is the best word that I can think of to describe this season. There was no real direction this season was headed and that was a big negative for me. From a rushed origin story that takes up all but one episode and some cringy dialogue sprinkled throughout, the series never found its footing. For a comedy series, I laughed at a couple jokes, but most jokes only received a slight grin from me. Despite those complaints, the show is carried a great performance from Tatiana Maslany. She is so perfect as She-Hulk and her comedic delivery was some of the best in the MCU to date. I really enjoyed how she broke the fourth wall with the audience, but I wish it was used a bit more. I found that the writers would use it maybe once per episode to remind the audience that it is there and then neglect it for the entire episode. The cameos were great, and the series had some fantastic parody of the real world. It was amazing to see the MCU poke fun at its fans and at itself at times. Overall, She-Hulk had some amazing potential but fails to capture any type of momentum fumbling its way to the grand finale, which was awesome and one of my favorite episodes.

**Score:** _63%_ |
**Verdict:** _Decent_ | She-Hulk has sort of a temper on her doesn't she?  And yet she can totally control her power better than the Hulk, who is Mark, so we should really call him Woke Hulk and her Woker Hulk.

The entire series is based around politics, and one sided in your face, shrieking at the top of your lungs about how you have to hate people based on their race, sexuality, and gender in order to not hate other people based on their race, sexuality, and gender...

... and at the end it feels sort of like it was written by, for, and staring that idiot at the Pride Parade that screams at Gay men for oppressing transpeople because they still identify as men.  It makes no sense but it seems PC. | **Dead on arrival.**

To be honest, I expected this to be garbage. And oh boy, how did the show deliver on that!

The thing is, if there is something deeply wrong with the main character and/or the heart and soul of the show in general, it's going to fall apart and leave the viewer not interested. And now we got an obnoxious M*ry-S*e for a main character and it's just unbearable to watch. Dead on arrival. | _She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_ kicks off with a bang, delivering the kind of goofy, self-aware superhero fun that Marvel’s been missing. Tatiana Maslany is a revelation as Jennifer Walters, effortlessly blending humor and heart in her portrayal of a 30-something attorney who just happens to turn into a giant green Hulk. Whether she’s dealing with legal cases, disastrous dates, or an unexpected supervillain crash-landing into court, Maslany makes every moment shine.

This show leans hard into the comedy, and it works. With its case-of-the-week structure and hilarious cameos, _She-Hulk_ feels like a Marvel series that’s finally comfortable just having fun. It’s light, it’s breezy, and it never takes itself too seriously. And honestly, that’s exactly what makes it stand out in the MCU lineup. You’re not here for world-ending stakes; you’re here to laugh, enjoy some wild guest stars, and watch Jennifer juggle her chaotic personal and professional life.

Yes, the CGI might be a bit spotty at times, but it’s not enough to detract from the show’s charm. If you’re focused on that, you’re missing out on what _She-Hulk_ does best — delivering a fun, witty, and unapologetically feminist take on the superhero genre. The meta humor, especially Jennifer’s direct call-outs to the audience, takes the experience to another level. This is a show that’s in on the joke, and it’s not afraid to poke fun at itself and the fandom.

And speaking of poking fun, the way _She-Hulk_ tackles internet trolls and toxic fandom is genius. It’s not subtle, but it’s exactly what’s needed. Jennifer’s bold, messy, and real, and when she’s shutting down the haters — both in-universe and in real life — it feels so satisfying.

The cameos are another highlight. From Wong to Daredevil, these guest appearances don’t just feel like fan service; they’re seamlessly integrated into the story and add to the overall fun. Madisynn King, portrayed by Patty Guggenheim, steals the spotlight in her brief but unforgettable role. Her bizarre friendship with Wong — or “Wongers” as she affectionately calls him — is a standout moment of the series, and her lines are pure comedy gold.

At its core, _She-Hulk_ is a comedy, and for what it aims to do, it nails it. Sure, it’s not the most groundbreaking series in terms of plot, but that’s not what it’s going for. It’s a refreshing break from the darker, more serious superhero shows out there. The stakes aren’t life or death, and that’s honestly one of its biggest strengths. It’s pure entertainment, with a perfect balance of action, humor, and a little bit of heart.

If you’re looking for a wild, fun, and feminist twist on the superhero formula, _She-Hulk_ is your show. It’s not trying to change the world — it’s here to make you laugh and give you a good time, and in today’s TV landscape, that’s more than enough.","Tatiana Maslany, Ginger Gonzaga, Jameela Jamil, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Josh Segarra",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

The little adventures themselves are thought out well and connect to the bigger plot in some way somehow. The unforgivable problem with this show is the appalling characters with their ridiculous haircuts, the dumb and dumber dialogues they are having, poor decision making of said characters, and finally, the ""modern"" special effects boring the hell out of anyone who has seen two or more popular sci-fi movies. Complete with useless CGI zoom ins, asteroid dodging space vehicle race, disregard for thermodynamics, gravity, biology, common sense or simple logic. Just pretty moving pictures straight from the PC of some overworked and over-payed dude with no imagination of his own insulting the intelligence of the viewer. By the way, nice harem the captain of this universe has going for him, the first time he steps on his bridge not a single man in sight. Which does not reduce the quality of this show to trash of course, the poor writing achieves that on its own just fine. | This series took until near the end of season one to get ahold of me.... Once it did (get ahold of me) I was hooked!

The characters are well put together (even Spock) and the stores get better and better with each new one. The only exception to this, was S02E09, which is one of the infamous 'singing' themes. Yes, you heard me. So many TV shows have done a singing episode... and they rarely work (for me). With the exception of the Buffy The Vampire Slayer episode titled; One More Time With Feeling. That was a brilliant singing episode.

The last episode of season 2 is a Cliff hanger, unfortunately. So we have a LONG wait to see the conclusion. Let's hpe they renew it for a season 3  :O) | The only thing strange about this series is the notion its radically different from Picard and Discovery. As far as I'm aware it utilises essentially the same team, who created the other ""new Trek"" shows. 

In my opinion, its writing is mediocre, full of plot holes and predictably woke. Sure, the political correctness has been toned down but it's still there, in all its fussy, lecturing, needy, simpering glory. 

I tried one episode and that was more than enough for me to walk away. To my mind, this is original Star Trek ""dress up"" devoid of the quality story telling, wit and honest charm, that made the original series a sci fi cult classic. 

Sorry but this ""aint Jim Kirk"" or anything even close...... | This series is a great relief from the altogether forgettable drama arcs in the most recent of the 2020s Star Trek series.  Star Trek: Strange New Worlds throws back to the episodic 'Lesson of the Day' format familiar to and loved by the fans of TOS, TNG, and VOY.

The episodes are written in the same style with somewhat standard plot lines that make the series feel fresh with takes on modern morality and a broad range of character archetypes. Watching the series feels like a welcomed step back in time. Stories can be told in 45 minutes without needing cliffhangers to keep the audience engaged. Character development is well integrated.

Writing this at the end of Season 1 the series has yet to prove itself a more worthy prequel than Enterprise in the question of revisionist history. There are many pitfalls to avoid for any prequel series and so far Strange New Worlds has navigated them with few questionable decisions.

The first season was truly great Star Trek. I have hopes that the second season will be just as great or better than the first. | *****
Some folks should not write reviews. Their negativity so obviously reveals their desperate need to sound cultured and knowledgeable; straining to sound relevant  as if they have an opinion that matters because of their vast experience as a filmmaker.  All the while taking a break from playing video games in their mom's basement to try to find problems with a program they streamed.

Each of the Star Trek series had their own personalities, their own charms and attractions, and their own foibles.   The common thread separating them from other sci fi being a fable daring the viewer to think about their preconceptions and the things that they believed are true.   This isn't ""woke"", it isn't preachy.  Its putting a story in front of a shallow, narrow minded audience (like those who use labels like ""woke"" and ""preachy"") and challenging them to first even recognize what's happening and then to think about it and their own world view.

I remember watching the original Star Trek series on my parents black and white tv. 
Each week seemed like another message that challenged my young views and beliefs.  And it seemed that, like now, so many think more about critiquing the medium and never consider the message.  

I've watched and enjoyed to varying degrees all of the trek series (even the animated one!).  This Trek is different.  Its not Next Gen, its not Enterprise, its not DS9 or voyager.  Its not even Discovery even though it seems to have grown from that branch.   No, this Trek is the first one that feels like the original series.  It took nearly 60 years, but i think they finally re-captured the lightening in the bottle that made Gene Roddenberry's ""wagon train to the stars"" so special.

Sadly, like the original Trek, the average shallow viewer focuses on minutia and just doesn't get it.  I fear that, like the original Trek, this one will go the way of the pearl before the swine.   I hope its not the case, because this one, perhaps more than the others that were commercially successful, deserves to go the distance. | Strange Indeed. Really, this series, as far as I'm concerned, has nothing remotely in common with the original Star Trek. 

Instead, even season 2 which I dipped into recently, hasn't improved. I suspect, this is, once again, really only going to appeal to a very narrow demographic of wet and whiny, pretentious wokester's.

Whats really unfortunate too, is armed with decent writing, sensible characterisations that evoke the vibe of the 60's series, this could have actually worked. What a shame.....""beam me up Scotty, there's still nothing to see here"". | Best Trek Ever!

Strange New Worlds uses the episodic format of the original series, which allows the writers to experiment without locking a whole season into a single story.  While it doesn't shy away from darker themes the show manages to keep a positive tone overall - something that has been lacking in many of the other recent Star Trek series.

The negative reviews are rather funny with their complaints about ""wokeness"" and going on to say how Strange New Words is not like the original series.  They make it clear these doofuses have never actually watched the original.  ST:TOS had a very diverse cast for broadcast television at the time, and many of the episodes were not even close to subtle in terms of message.

For example:

""This Side of Paradise"" (s1e24) had strong themes reflecting the peacenik, hippie ""drop out"" subculture, and psychedelic drug use of the late 1960s.

""The Devil in the Dark"" (s1e25) had a misunderstood enemy who was reacting to the unthinking destruction of their young by humans.

""Friday's Child"" (s2e11) was specifically written to be a story about a strong woman who did not necessarily want children.

""A Private Little War"" (s2e19) was an allegory on the Vietnam War

""Plato's Stepchildren"" (s3e10) included one of the first instances of a kiss between a white man and a black woman.

Strange New Worlds continues the tradition set by the original series of calling attention to societal issues in a science fiction setting.  Complaints about this reflect more upon the reviewers themselves than the actual show. | I am a big sci-fi fan. And Star Trek is one the many that I love to watch. Season 2 just gave me the bitter aftertaste of it. A courtroom drama? Really? The whole episode? What's next, a musical? Oh wait, there is an episode further down with it. Season 2 is disappointing. STRANGE NEW WORLDS for me talks about discovering new planets and beings from that world. NOT a courtroom drama. I kind of seeing what's in store for Season 3, Days of Our Lives.

This show reminded me of how much I used to love Adventure Time because of the excitement, mystery, laughter, crying, and certainly adventure.I'm writing this review when the first two episodes of the show air, so I'll just review them.

The beginning of the first episode shows us the world of Fionna and what the human world would be like if the mushroom bomb had not exploded. I liked in this episode the amount of details present, and this would indicate the extent of the interest of the writers and animators in the work. I also liked that all the new characters retained part of the The original characters’ behaviors.

The second episode I can say quite simply that it is one of the best episodes of Adventure Time, if not the best. Knowing how the life of the Ice King became after removing the crown is one of the things that we were looking forward to as fans. Also, in this episode we met a character that we had not met for a long time who brought back what he did.  Nostalgia and love for adventure time. I also liked that this character still maintains his nature.

American Horror Story tires to do it, only on a much larger scale with a new story each season that is supposed to be connected in a grandiose way...and that is fine but...

Tales From the Crypt just offered a new and unique story each week, written and directed and acted by some very talented people. Some are science fiction, some were westerns, some were monster stories, some were comedies, but all were exceptionally well crafted.

Part of the draw to it was that missing a week didn't mean you had to catch up at all. And part of it was that, if you didn't like a particular episode you could come back next week and see something entirely different.

If you like Terminator movies, battlestar Galatia/Caprica then this will be a treat.

I saw bits on TV but never could get the story, that's due to the story arc, you have to watch every episode (except 1). There are slow bits but worth watching for the high bits.

S1 is good story character building, each character has back stories or future stories.

S2 really hits the high mark except for 1crap episode.

S3 never happened just when the show found the Awe-factor.

My only con is due to the fact that it is called Sarah Connor Chronicles, some episodes seems like they wrote her into the story just due to the title. Over 60secs of SC talking was a drag especially when JC started to become the stronger character, some parts seemed to be written to try to make SC relevant, towards the end of S2 that didn't fit the story line. Thats why maybe the title worked against the show and should of been more generic like Terminator: the pre-Judgement-Chronicles.

-Tom | Yeah, I am still bitter that they canceled this.  I mean BITTER, I really got into this.  it was entertaining and it felt like it was only just taking off and CANCELED!!!!  That breaks this heart, I wanted at least 4 seasons and a movie.

But, I guess the good things never last. I am going to blame marketing for this, given that I remember hearing about them making a series...and then I didn't even realize what channel it was on until almost the end of the second and final season. So that could be why, but who knows.

The good news is that Sarah Connor completely and totally disavows T3. The story starts with T2 ending the movie canon and believe me we are all greatful for that.

The fact is that Lena Headey pulls off tough really well in this, almost better than...I feel so dirty saying this...but almost better than Linda Hamilton. At least, I liked Headey more in the role. She seemed to balance the mother and the soldier a lot better than Hamilton did--though she had scarce opportunity to do it in the movies.

Summer Glau is the new good Terminator and, for those of you that haven't seen it, she is threatening in this. She is small and thin and really very ominous in her role and given her size, being as believably threatening as she was is just pure talent. There is no way someone with her figure could pull that off without really knowing how to act.

And the cool thing about this is that John Connor--Thomas Dekker--isn't the savior of humanity yet and that was a big draw because even though the movie focuses on his mother, had the series lasted longer we could have seen how he developed into the man that saves humanity form the machines and I really would have loved to see that.

Alas all we have are two awesome seasons and a lot of angry fans and even though it is incomplete, it is something that is worth watching, it's fantastically entertaining and everyone does a great job.

It's worth your time, despite the disappointment of an early demise.","Lena Headey, Thomas Dekker, Summer Glau, Richard T. Jones, Shirley Manson",1.0,False,0.0,2008.0

Pretty much every episode without a titan was trash IMHO, but it was simply because I was expecting to see more titans and learn more about them. However, if you look at the series title, it says “Monarch” - this is about people (an organisation), not about titans.

That being said, some story elements were inconsistent, like regular humans surviving a building dropping on their heads and coming out with a “broken” leg that they can walk on without a cane? I've had a broken leg before, and I couldn't walk.

So, regardless of my disappointment about the lack of titans, there were other elements that made this not live up to its potential.

And this televised version did a credible job moving the tale to the screen. It is a passable horror story.

This review is just for the first season, Netflix has renewed it for a second season and it's not hard to see why. Not many shows have generated discussion like this and i think Netflix appreciates a show that has high viewership and large debate.

The debate interestingly isn't just fan theories and character motivations or speculation on whats to come but also whether or not the show sucks. Which goes back to the heading The OA isn't for everyone.

Brit Marling plays Prairie Johnson a blind woman who returns to her home town after resurfacing seven years after being kidnapped with her eyesight restored and now calling herself The OA. From there a genuinely intriguing science fiction/fantasy mystery unfolds through flashbacks alongside some humdrum small town/highschool drama that occurs in the present with the enigmatic Prairie in the middle of it.

I think The OA should be treated like an eight hour movie rather than an eight episode TV show. Whether or not you love or hate the OA won't be up to the first couple of episodes it will really come down to the final five minutes of the final episode **SPOILERS KINDA** which at best is utterly ridiculous or at worst (keeping recent history in mind) downright offensive to some. 

Like most of Brit Marling's work its very intriguing and worth taking a look at, it will stay with you for a while as you mull it over in your head. | This was my favorite TV show. I'm very sad that they canceled it. It's about parallel worlds and very interesting and tense. After watching any episode it will leave you with the desire to immediately watch another one. Acting is great. I'm a big fan of Brit Marling and she definitely delivers high performance in this TV show. I personally think that this TV show was a masterpiece. I still can't believe they canceled it. | I'm fan of Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij's movies. After watching ""Sound of my voice"" (which was amazing by the way), I gave a try this TV show and holy gods, it's amazing. It's full of mystery and very addicting. To be honest, after watching ""Lords of Chaos"", which I gave low rating and was awful (in my opinion), I thought actors were bad & couldn't act, but seems like I was wrong when I saw performance of Emory Cohen in these series (same guy who played Varg in ""Lords of Chaos""). He delivers powerful acting in this one. If you're into mystery movies about parallel dimensions this TV show is a must-watch and it's so great you want to watch with non stop. It's definitely one of the best TV series on Netflix. It has very special atmosphere. I enjoyed every episode of this TV show and I'm shocked that they canceled it. I was waiting for another reason so much... I can definitely says that this masterpiece is my favorite TV show. | Wow. I loved this. Particularly the second series. The first was very good but very disturbing and I felt very uneasy watching it. The whole thing was really clever and really well done. So difficult not to binge as at the end of every episode you feel a step closer to understanding the meaning of existence.

Anyone saying this is original has a bad working memory of the Fresh Prince. They recycle so many storylines in this show sometimes multiple old storylines per episode. The only difference is theres no depth and its extra dramatic. The characters have no room to grow and I dont see why or how were supposed to care about any of them. Maybe if this wasn't tied to the fresh prince it could've been original and stood on its own. Really its just bad rehashed fresh prince plots with added drama that feels as fake as the characters. The family sitcom had more heart and realistic drama than this show will ever be capable of. The casting is also so off the mark, the fan made trailer ( that will copied to make this show) had better casting. RIP Uncle Phil, try as they might they will never get close to James Avery or the heart he brought to the role. Not to mention Geoffrey is knock off Edris Elba and has a man killed. Its just utterly ridiculous drama bait that disrespects the complexities of the original sitcom. It is sad to see Will understands so little about what made the original great.

Is that enough words, because I'd rather not waste too many, on whatever this is..... | ""Star Wars: The Acolyte"" is a gripping addition to the Star Wars saga, exploring the darker side of the Force in an era set before the prequel trilogy. Directed by Leslye Headland, the film delves into the rise of the Sith through the eyes of a young acolyte, played brilliantly by Amandla Stenberg. The movie stands out with its rich, atmospheric visuals and a compelling narrative that balances intense action with deep character development. ""The Acolyte"" offers a fresh perspective on the Star Wars universe, captivating both long-time fans and newcomers with its blend of mystery, intrigue, and dark fantasy elements. | Yes, I want entertainment. I repeat, I want entertainment. Is it really that difficult? Simply awfully bad, bad and bad! With this abomination Star Wars should RIP for good. | This series is a shame, a shame to Stars Wars and its fans, it brings nothing new and destroys everything that has been built.

The series continues on the path to the destruction of the character of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, the face of the Saga

Episode 9 in particular had largely destroyed the character and everything he represents for the Star Wars universe, this series comes to plant the last stabs... We wonder how Star Wars ""connoisseurs"" have could come up with such scenarios

It is by far Disney's worst creation in the Star Wars universe with the last trilogy and in particular its episode 9 | _The Acolyte_ brings a refreshing change of pace to the Star Wars universe, blending a murder mystery with horror vibes and featuring a diverse cast. Here's what stood out:

Jodie Turner-Smith's performance was captivating and brought a fresh energy to the series, making her character one of the most engaging. Carrie-Ann Moss, as always, delivered a powerful and compelling portrayal, adding depth and gravitas to her role. Manny Jacinto's charisma and acting skills were a standout, making his character one of the highlights of the show.

The fight choreography was expertly crafted, providing thrilling and dynamic combat scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. The innovative and visually stunning use of Force powers and lightsabers added a unique flair, enhancing the overall excitement. A Wookie wielding a lightsaber is a fan's dream come true, adding an extra layer of excitement and novelty to the series.

However, there were elements that fell short. Vernestra's character felt underdeveloped and directionless, making it hard to connect with her. It would have been more engaging to have Indara in her place. I also struggled to care about Osha and Mae, as these characters failed to evoke empathy or interest, detracting from the emotional weight of the story. Due to the lack of connection with Osha and Mae, moments meant to be tense felt hollow and unimpactful. Certain parts of the script and episode structure lacked the strength to create a fulfilling narrative arc, resulting in a disjointed experience.

Despite these drawbacks, _The Acolyte_ manages to carve out its own identity within the Star Wars franchise. The fight scenes are exhilarating, and the thought put into the story is evident. However, some scenes with CGI don’t feel cohesive with the ADR, and at times, they seem lackluster compared to the rest of the Star Wars franchise.

While there are weak points in character development and script, the series still offers a lot to enjoy for Star Wars fans. Its unique blend of genres and strong performances make it a worthwhile addition to the Star Wars saga.","Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae",0.0,False,0.0,2024.0

Worse still, with the need to push a message the one thing it forgot to do was be engaging, interesting and simply put, enjoyable.

Unfortunately, it is rather sad to hear that Ruby Rose left the show. I suppose there were secret hints throughout the last few episodes suggesting Rose's departure. And to be honest, the final episode of season 1 felt anti-climatic, in comparison to the other DC shows.

And the reason this is important is because she fought Hordak and the Evil Horde. And she did it to be a hero and save Eternia from Evil.

This She-Ra looks like a child. And you can't have a child fight and go on the same kind of adventures that you can an adult. Even when it's animated you can't have a child do the same dangerous things an adult does.

So the result is that this She-Ra, the 2018 one that looks like a child doesn't really fight to be a hero and save Eternia from the same evil menace. She's depicted as being too young to do that, so instead she goes on stupid and silly little adventures.

And that isn't She-Ra. She-Ra was intended to be ""The Princess of Power,"" she was intended to be a warrior. She was supposed to fight evil, to save Eternia, and be a hero.

They depicted this She-Ra as a child and because she looks like a child she stopped being the ""Princess of Power"" and started being just a ""Princess of Silliness and Cute."" and that's not She-Ra.

And honestly, I don't know how that is offensive or violates any guidelines | ""[...] you can't have a child fight and go on the same kind of adventures that you can an adult. Even when it's animated you can't have a child do the same dangerous things an adult does."" - The bigotry that passes for reviews on TMDB. It would be funny if it wasn't so outlandish.

Here's another ""review"" that exists only to offset the bigotry. I never watched the original She-Ra, nor do I ever care to. I vaguely remember He-Man from my childhood but again, I don't care. I watched a couple episodes of the new He-Man and couldn't be bothered to continue. However, I watched every episode of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power and I rated it 10/10 and gave it a heart, didn't I? Yes I did.

I vaguely remember being irritated by Bow's exposed stomach though.

One day I might re-watch this and give it the ""review"" it deserves, until then, sit back, shelve the sexism and the bigotry, and enjoy the ride.","Aimee Carrero, Karen Fukuhara, AJ Michalka, Marcus Scribner, Reshma Shetty",0.0,False,0.0,2018.0

So, I watched the entire show today.  I have to say it was one of those stories you just couldn't leave lying.  I had to finish it.  To put it briefly, it was an incredibly solid true crime Tv Show.  Highly reminiscent of True Detective and Mindhunters.  Right up there in the same caliber.    

I don't think it was better than Mindhunters, but I do think it was better than True Detective S1.  So that is where I stand.

Now this show was great.  It lacked some details about the main character I would have liked, they never really explored him.  I never really felt like I got to know him.  Even when he was telling the antagonist it didn't feel genuine, and I don't think it was supposed too anyway.  He was lying very often to garner the thing he needed from the antagonist.
Perhaps the highlight of the show would be the character of Larry Hall, played surrealistically by Paul Walter Hauser.  Who said he was incredibly happy to be able to work with Ray Liotta, who passed during the filming of this show.  Paul's acting elevated to an entirely new level.  He continues playing the soft-spoken innocent guy mostly, until he can't help but show his true dark side.  It's uncanny how well Hauser did.  Definitely reminds me of Mindhunters and Ed Kemper's actor.  

There is a sense of being played with by the antagonist throughout the show that makes you feel like the main character, being toyed with almost.  
I suppose the rest of the show wasn't really too standout.  It was shot well.  Especially the episode before the finale.  The director really nailed the tension in that beginning scene with the therapist.  I suppose the show stands out as 4 stars to me because I couldn't drop it all day.   I suppose I should change the rating to 3.5 to better reflect that its certainly above average but perhaps not in Zodiac (fincher) territory.

If it's a question about these filmmakers talents?  It has been answered.  Solid, Solid show.  It felt a little rushed at the end in that last episode but ok.  

Really recommend it.  My particular bent for this type of story is that the Antagonist really makes me wonder why God creates serial killers.

There is a line in a Koan poem by a Zen monk, that I was reminded of while watching it.   Thich Naht Hanh wrote it.

A prison where serial killers and the like, are humanely studied, like lab rats, so more like them, can be caught and presumably, in turn, ""studied"".

Yes, the premise is a little outlandish but still interesting. The acting is solid and the characterisations, are at least mildly convincing. The first episode, is alright with a twist in the end, that showed some imagination and ingenuity. So a tick in the box there. 

In summary, a formulaic, moderately watchable US crime drama that, thus far, has made a little more effort than most of its kind, in the storytelling department. Lets hope they keep it up.","Melissa Roxburgh, Nick Wechsler, Patrick Sabongui, Josh McKenzie, Sara Alicia Garcia",0.0,False,0.0,2025.0

lawman,"Lawman is an American western television series originally telecast on ABC from 1958 to 1962 starring John Russell as Marshal Dan Troop and featuring Peter Brown as Deputy Marshal Johnny McKay. The series was set in Laramie, Wyoming during 1879 and the 1880s. Warner Bros. already had several western series on the air at the time, having launched Cheyenne with Clint Walker as early as 1955. The studio continued the trend in 1957 with the additions of Maverick with James Garner and Jack Kelly, Colt .45 with Wayde Preston, and Sugarfoot with Will Hutchins. One year later, Warner Bros. added Lawman and Bronco with Ty Hardin.

Prior to the beginning of production, Russell and Brown and producer Jules Schermer made a pact to maintain the quality of the series so that it would not be seen as ""just another western.""

At the end of the day it's exactly the sort of thing that film needs.  We need a film, a TV show, that breaks down the self-imposed political censorship.  The Idol does just that and I look at it as a positive step in the right direction, we need more media to force it's way through that crap so we can get back to making media that is actually good again.

This isn't exactly Chinatown, but it is a step away from making pure political propaganda and a step towards making films to entertain again.  And the more we have crap that pushes back against it, the closer we get to pop culture for the sake of entertainment again.

People compare it to Showgirls, and that's not accurate, it has a lot more depth than Showgirls, it is satirical of a lot more than Showgirls ever was.  It points more fingers.

"gomer pyle, u.s.m.c.","Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. is an American situation comedy that originally aired on CBS from September 25, 1964, to May 2, 1969. The series was a spinoff of The Andy Griffith Show, and the pilot was aired as the finale of the fourth season of The Andy Griffith Show on May 18, 1964. The show ran for five seasons and a total of 150 episodes. In 2006, CBS Home Entertainment began releasing the series on DVD. The final season was released in November 2008.

The series was created by Aaron Ruben, who also produced the show with Sheldon Leonard and Ronald Jacobs. Filmed and set in California, it stars Jim Nabors as Gomer Pyle, a naive but good-natured gas-station attendant from the town of Mayberry, North Carolina, who enlists in the United States Marine Corps. Frank Sutton plays Gomer's high-octane, short-fused Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter, and Ronnie Schell plays Gomer's friend Gilbert ""Duke"" Slater. Allan Melvin played in the recurring role of Gunnery Sergeant Carter's rival, Sergeant Charley Hacker. The series never discussed nor addressed the then-current Vietnam War, instead focusing on the relationship between Gomer and Sergeant Carter. The show retained high ratings throughout its run.","Comedy, Family",7.1,4.034187539397548,3.332204510175204,False,Ended,1.6094379124341003,5.0106352940962555,3.295836866004329,Foxtel Now,No reviews,"Jim Nabors, Frank Sutton, Ronnie Schell",0.0,False,0.0,1964.0

Whats very likeable about this series, is, in a sense, also its key shortcoming. 

Jeff Bridges who plays the main character a wanted CIA spook, is possessed of a downbeat, affable quality that belies the mans deadlier qualities. The result is when he is forced to transition from one persona to the other, its a discordant experience. This is, I suspect, just what the writers wanted and its a ploy that works beautifully. The harsh transition from harmless and friendly to fierce, captures your attention and holds it. 

Its also what does not work so well. The old man stereotype with a range of ailments, popping pills and walking stiltedly, is overplayed. So much so, that it somewhat undermines the deadly assassin alter ego. You start asking how a man portrayed as this enfeebled, could take on and defeat trained men half his age? Of course, in hand to hand he probably couldn't and whilst this is suggested, at the same time the series is still pushing this premise. The presence of two attack dogs is supposed to help explain this away too but in actuality, their actions, create, at times, implausible plot holes.  

This series would have worked a little better is the ""old geezer"" aspects of the character had been downplayed a little more and the mans years of training and experience, was given more emphasis.

That said, there is a hell of lot more to like here than not. Its an enjoyable romp, that's comes armed with decent writing and as I said, a  great cast. Action is well paced and the improbable elements of the story don't stop it from being fast paced and enjoyable. Mixing as it does clever dialogue, well rounded characters with lots of violent exposition. 

8/10 from me. | The ridiculous woke scene at the end of episode 4, and the ensuing simping in episode 5 ruined it. It's completely unrealistic and makes no sense, at that point I lost all respect for the main character and couldn't watch anymore of it. I can't find where it says who the director is but I assume it must be a woman and I imagine it was a change she made to story because of the obvious feminist gender bias, making an insignificant female character the dominant character over the main character just because she's a female. Up until that point I was completely engaged and enjoying the show. | The first episode of this series showed so much promise. It was enthralling, different and worked in spite of a few improbable aspects.

Sadly, by episode four, I felt the strong sense that anything The Old Man had aspired to be, was, well, getting old.

The chemistry between the two main characters started to falter, the story line seemed increasingly ridiculous and the sense of momentum and urgency, so cleverly crafted early on, was on the wane.

The anti Russian message is well past its use by date too, adding to the sense that things had gone stale.

In summary, what can I say, ""what a shame!"". A great premise, an interestingly original story and quality acting is not enough to save this series from being ""just another espionage thriller."" | In the entire season 1, there may have been three action scenes. All the rest are people talking. People sitting at a table, talking. People standing in the dark, talking. People sitting in a car (not moving), talking. People sitting in a car (moving in a straight line), talking. One person sitting at a desk while another leans against a wall, talking. Talking, talking, talking, talking, talking.

The show didn't GO anywhere. I can't understand how it's so well received when it's just so boring.

My two regrets are that I wasted those hours of my life and that I couldn't give it less than half a star.","Jeff Bridges, John Lithgow, Alia Shawkat, Navid Negahban, Jacqueline Antaramian",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

Now, a little older (though I have my doubts about wiser), and able to function a little more normally even when faced with such sights (seriously though... those eyes!), I would just like to take a moment to comment on what a fantastic character Sgt Zeke Anderson is. He doesn't only hold the platoon together on the show, but does much the same for the show itself too. I have my doubts as to whether the show would be even a tenth as good without his character, or without Terence Knox's excellent performance. As it is, it's a show well worth watching, and worth listening to too, as the soundtrack is fantastic! | This is a wonderful show that in today's view I wish would have gotten a few more seasons. However, sometimes you just got to enjoy what is given to us.

The first season was filmed in Hawaii and gave a more realistic representation of Vietnam, sequential seasons were filmed in California to cut costs and make it easier for production. 

While the first season has more ""in the bush"" footage because of location, the second and third season focus more with ""On Base"" and ""Real World"" issues that the war brought on.

Each character is lovingly detailed and their back story explained. Sometimes you wish you had a little more time with one character or the other in an episode but the following picks up with that character to get a feel for who they are.

Mid season 2 a few new characters are brought in which generally don't mix well with the season 1 vibe. It started to turn to a drama and love story between a few main characters and less on war. Then the next episode was back to war and the tragedies of it.

Thankfully a lot of that is flushed out in season 3 to end on a good note.","Stephen Caffrey, Terence Knox, Miguel A. Núñez Jr., Tony Becker, Stan Foster",1.0,True,1.0,1987.0

1. I like the fact that they're trying to do something new with Spider-Man, but i think they focus too much in his hero side more than his normal life side.
2. The animations, the art and the CGI is the worst that i've ever seen in a Spider-Man TV Show, needs a lot of improvement, especially the cars and the backgrounds.
3. Spider-Man is way too cringy, and makes some stupid jokes.

**_SEASON 02:_**

It was like last week I saw season 1, good to see the proceeding. Yeah, the story moves on, but it was totally different than the first. The initial setup was a road trip, then in the middle of the season, it settled down where the remaining story took place.

After knowing the god is missing, Jesse the preacher along with his two friends embark to find him in various places. They come close yet unreachable. Besides, they go through a lot. A lot of obstacles, particularly the Saint of Killers was the most interesting aspect. Then there's an old man who adds the other interesting fact. Don't believe how he had ended, because they did not show that shot properly. So expect a surprise in the follow up.

On the other side of the tale, there's hell. Eugene, who has been stuck in the hell reveals his side of the struggle. He meets the most recognised historical figure. I mean in the hell, who could be it. I thought this perspective was unnecessary, but it made sense as the overall season was unfolded, Especially when it had ended, it left a big clue what might come in the next season. That would be a great clash, can't wait for it.

On paper, this season's basic plot seems silly, but they have turned it awesomely. Not as good as the first, yet still enjoyable. There were many surprises, that keeps the viewers hooked, episode after episode. Those who like Tulip might not be happy how the season had ended, particularly for her, but who know what might come in the next. So finger crossed and looking forward to it.

Interview with the Vampire, for me, largely misses the mark on each and every count.The characters don't feel like the Rice's, they lack the personality and finesse, she infused her characters with. The time period/setting is in many respects, off the mark, too. 

Worse still, there's is politic's infused into this work. There's a dash of rather obvious negative Russian messaging and yet more woke-ism, I personally, could have done without. 

Acting is of a high standard. I feel its a genuine shame so much else is off. This could have worked if they had paid closer attention to Rice's actual work and knocked off the unwelcome messaging. 

In short, high production values and decent acting can't save this series from feeling, to this fan at least, nothing like Rice's work. The movie with Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise from the 90's, beautifully captures the essence of Rice's work and is my recommended screen adaptation. | So this is one of those titles that IMDb will remove your review if it's not positively glowing.

I'm not sure why, the source material was already really progressive.  It was essentially a story about two Gay men who happen to be vampires... and their violent break up.  But it was subtle, it was artistic, and it had more of a story to tell about good and evil among other things.

Subtle is the key, because in the 2022 version, there is nothing subtle or artistic.  Vampires can't have sex in the novels to up the sexual tension and angst.  In this title I guess they didn't think it would be woke enough if it wasn't 9 and 1/2 Weeks with Vampires. 

And then they changed Louis, which means that they had to change the entire timeline of the title, and that caused a little bit of complications with everything else, because even though there was a strong message about freeing his slaves in the book... they couldn't have it in the movie...

...Because when you are woke things don't need to make any sense.  

And they aged Claudia up, and that presented significant changes and relieved some of what made her character so compelling.

In the end they took a beautiful novel and turned it into cheap fan fiction porn with politics and the people are eating it up.

Because in this day and age, you can't respect the source material, you have to trash it. | Oh, Americans with their obsession with race and LGBT propaganda...

This TV show is nothing new, just another woke crap thing coming from Holywood. Didn't expect anything good from them nowadays...

I'm not rating this show too low because production and acting is decent, but it's a shame that all this must be ruined by propaganda and agenda. I can't give this show more than 4/10, sorry, well actually, I'm not sorry.","Jacob Anderson, Sam Reid, Assad Zaman, Delainey Hayles, Ben Daniels",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

Animations are (always) underrated for the majority, but if I could offer you _(non-animation consumer)_ **ONE** contemporary animated production to watch, it’d be Pantheon. But to be fair and even more accurate on my recommendation, this is a show for whom: 
1. Loves SciFi and is still wondering if we all live in a simulation. 
2. Like to catch Easter eggs here-and-there. 
3. Is opened to deeper reflections about the future and its endless possibilities.

There are two seasons, the first is focused on the action and building the characters. The second is way more Philosophical and by the end of it you may need some time to digest its storytelling. 

I loved it, I’m not sure if I am ready for UIs, but it’s a very intriguing subject.

Eu sinceramente espero que vc, lendo esse review, esteja aberto a animações com temas mais maduros, porque Pantheon é exatamente esse tipo de história nesse tipo de mídia. 
É uma obra de ficção científica que lembra ~um pouco, ou melhor,~ muito Matrix. É uma dessas histórias que ao final da segunda temporada vc pode vir a se questionar o que é realidade? Os átomos e a matéria definem a realidade, ou como Descartes colocou, _“penso, logo existo”_? 
E ouso apontar que talvez seja essa a primeira de muitas vezes que vc “ouvirá” falar de **UI** (Uploaded Intelligence). Boa jornada, espero que goste!","Katie Chang, Paul Dano, Daniel Dae Kim, Rosemarie DeWitt, Aaron Eckhart",0.0,False,0.0,2022.0

1. The characters' names were cringy in my opinion.
2. I did not like Ariana Grande at the time.
3. It seemed like both titular characters were girly girls, which I do not like because of my tomboy nature.

But earlier today, I turned on Netflix and started to watch this series. I was deep into it within the first 5 minutes. And Cat's voice and tone of nature just made it funnier. I also learned that Sam is legit my fictional character double. This show is amazing and I can recommend it to literally anyone.

- Stephen King; _The Outsider_ (2018)

If you ever wondered what the first season of _True Detective_ might have looked like had the merely-hinted-at supernatural elements become more than merely hinted at, then _The Outsider_ gives you a possible answer. Starting as a grim and gritty police procedural, the show takes a left turn in the third episode, before diving head-first into the supernatural in the sixth and seventh. And do these two tones mix well? Kind of. The early episodes are easily the strongest, and as the hokey horror elements start to take over, the foreboding portentousness of those beautifully constructed episodes gives way to Stephen King-isms. Relatable themes such as guilt and the paralysis of grief are dropped in favour of larger (and thus more abstract) issues such as the infectious nature of evil and the ability of ordinary people to band together in extraordinary circumstances (as I said, it's King-101). But for all that, and despite the not entirely successful mixing of genres, I enjoyed the show. I hadn't read the novel, and so I was genuinely invested in finding out where all of everything led. And even though the journey (the early stages, in particular), proved more interesting than the destination, it was a journey that I don't regret taking.

Cherokee City, Georgia. When the badly mutilated corpse of a young boy, Frankie Peterson, is found in the woods, homicide detective Ralph Anderson (the always excellent Ben Mendelsohn) immediately launches an investigation. Partnered up with Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Yunis Sablo (an understated Yul Vazquez), within a few hours, it appears the murderer has been identified, with multiple witnesses reporting seeing local little league coach and school teacher Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman) covered in blood near the scene of the crime. When physical evidence and surveillance footage further point to Terry's guilt, a bull-headed Ralph, who is still grieving the death of his son several years prior, has Terry arrested in front of the whole town. As Terry's wife, Glory, (a suitably frazzled Julianne Nicholson) and his lawyer, Howie Solomon (Bill Camp; as good as he always is), scramble to understand what has happened, Terry maintains his innocence, saying he was at a teaching conference in another state on the day of the murder. And it doesn't take Solomon's investigator Alec Pelley (Jeremy Bobb) long to locate footage of Maitland at that conference. But how can one person be in two places at once? Such is the intriguing hook with which the show begins.

Airing on HBO, and based on the 2018 novel by Stephen King, the show was adapted for TV by acclaimed novelist Richard Price (_Clockers_, _Freedomland_, _Lush Life_, and a veteran of HBO dramas _The Wire_, _The Night Of_, _The Deuce_). Showrunners/executive producers include Price and Jason Bateman (who also co-stars and directs the first two episodes, establishing the _Ozark_-esque aesthetic template). Novelist Dennis Lehane (_Gone Baby Gone_; _Mystic River_; _Shutter Island_) also contributes scripts for two of the later episodes. Other characters include Jeannie Anderson (an exceptional Mare Winningham), Ralph's wife; Claude Bolton (Paddy Considine, excellent despite struggling with an American accent), manager of a local strip club; Jack Hoskins (a ferocious Marc Menchaca), a self-destructive and volatile homicide detective; Holly Gibson (Cynthia Evro), a recurring character in King's recent novels, best described as a pseudo-paranormal investigator; Andy Katcavage (Derek Cecil), a former homicide detective; Seale Bolton (Max Beesley), Claude's brother; Tamika Collins (Hettienne Park), homicide detective; and Kenneth Hayes (Michael Esper), Georgia DA.

If the show has a singular standout element (aside from the excellent ensemble cast), it's the aesthetic design. Bateman, who has directed multiple episodes of _Ozark_, establishes a dark and gritty tone in the first two episodes, imbuing every shot with a foreboding sense of unease. Shadows abound; bright colours are muted, with greys and washed-out blues dominating; characters are often shown isolated in long shot, framed in doorways, or pushed into corners; depth of field is often extremely shallow; camera movements are methodical and slow; the editing is non-linear enough to keep the narrative slightly off-kilter (although this non-linearity is confined primarily to the first two episodes and the opening of episode nine); there's even a split-diopter used at one point to keep the foreground and background in perfect focus. The show looks every inch an HBO prestige crime drama. There are also some nice directorial flourishes. For example, in the last episode (directed by Andrew Bernstein), as the good guys are moving through a cave, they pass a body of water and we see the villain's eyes non-diegetically reflected in the water, taking up almost all of the screen's real-estate. Sure, it's not subtle, but it looks damn good.

Perhaps the most noticeable aesthetic element is the discordant score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans, which helps the atmosphere, tone, and pacing immeasurably. Music cues are often just one deep note, held and elongated for up to two or three seconds. Oftentimes, entire scenes will be scored to these singular notes, giving whatever is on screen a sense of portentousness beyond the purely visual.

For all its aesthetic gymnastics, however, the show does have some problems both stylistic and narrative. For one thing, it's too long; eight episodes would have been more than sufficient to tell this story, and the narrative really starts to drag in episodes five and six. It picks up again in eight (which is largely a character-focused episode), but there's just not enough material to fill 10+ hours. There's also the genre-mixing mentioned earlier. What starts as a tough cop investigating a grisly murder morphs into a quirky paranormal sleuth chasing down an ancient evil, and as these two vie for space, neither genre feels fully developed. The early episodes are creepy and unnerving, with tone and atmosphere doing the heavy lifting. But as the show goes on, the horror becomes broader and less effective, and Price is never really able to fully yoke these two disparate elements into a cohesive whole.

Other problems (presumably) come from the source text, such as the first solid transition into the supernatural, which is based on a coincidence so preposterous that I was convinced the show would return to it to offer an explanation (it does not). There's also the merry band of blue-collar salt-of-the-Earth types who band together to face something beyond any one of them, a trope that King has done to death by this stage.

All in all though, I enjoyed _The Outsider_ for the most part. It has significant problems, but it does a lot right. The aesthetics and acting help a hell of a lot, and although it's far from the best King adaptation ever made (that would remain Frank Darabont's _The Green Mile_), it's a damn sight better than recent efforts such as Andy Muschietti's two _It_ films and (shudder) Nikolaj Arcel's _The Dark Tower_.","Ben Mendelsohn, Cynthia Erivo, Bill Camp, Jeremy Bobb, Julianne Nicholson",0.0,False,0.0,2020.0

The Imagination Movers TV series is based on the format and music of the New Orleans based music group Imagination Movers who both act and are co-executive-producers of the show.

On May 30, 2011, it was announced that the series will end after the remaining episodes of the third season have aired, though the band itself will continue and is open to doing other projects.

On November 28, 2011 the Movers ran an announcement on official Facebook page implying that they have been given the green light to air more new episodes of the show in 2012.","Comedy, Family",6.4,3.995610193234414,2.3978952727983707,False,Canceled,1.0986122886681098,4.30406509320417,3.295836866004329,"Disney Plus, TV 2 Play, Hotstar",No reviews,Kath Soucie,0.0,False,0.0,2008.0

The atmosphere and the characterisations, feel more akin to a mobster series, than one about hit men and assassins.

No doubt too, everyone, hate's each other but its all mobster  gaudiness, cheesy parties, back slapping and hugs. ""Ugh"". 

There is an attempt to insert a little upper crust pretension and big money, wheeler dealing over parking lots, of all things but by then, the breads well and truly buttered.

I'll be honest and say, I did not make it through the first episode. How on earth, did they get it this wrong? Its almost like the producers were given the script from another show, by mistake.

An exceptional series from the Wachowskis as long as you're not homophobic.

1. The writing is on point most of the time. Main characters and supporting characters shine.
2. The cast is fantastic.
3. The multiple shooting locations around the world was a boon to this series.
4. Bug is best buddy.

Honestly, Bae Doona, the Wachowskis, and talk of this series having LGBT characters and being pro-LGBT were what piqued my interest in it. I'm glad it I eventually watched it. There's so much humanity on display here and it's beautiful to watch. It's a shame that Netflix didn't let it run it's course more naturally. The series finale feels rushed as a result, but it ends the series fine enough.

To the racists who were offended, it was an insult.
I hate to generalize but when you upset two of today's most toxic groups, that believe they know something you don't, then you will certainly have my attention.

Lindelof's approach is not canon and it's fine. Watchmen's current and official sequel in the comic books ended last Wednesday with the release of Doomsday Clock #12 where the long-awaited confrontation between Dr. Manhattan and Superman will finally occur.

But personally I think it was a great show. He took the world from the comic book and gave it a different voice.
He built an interesting mystery around certain characters from the original story and rooted it in fairly relevant themes that as it showed from its first episode and until its last, encompass decades of hatred that are still alive today.

Until now it's believed that it will only be a stand-alone season and if so I'm okay with it.
I'm open to a second one, but I think the story that was told was enough. And believe me that I enjoyed it week by week since it started.

My only but and that's why I didn't give it the 5 stars is that despite the good handling of the plot, Lindelof made a mistake in order to make his romantic story work and that is that he weakened Dr. Manhattan. A lot.

I understand it's his vision, but you're telling me that Ozymandias being the smartest person in the world didn't manage to capture that omnipotent being but a flock of racists did? C'mon.

**Original Review (based on the season's first six episodes handed to press):**

When I discovered that a new show based on the world of Watchmen was in the works, I really didn't have any sort of reaction. But then it was announced that Damon Lindelof (responsible for co-creating my favorite TV series ever, Lost) was the mind behind all of it and that the show wouldn't follow either the graphic novel or Zack Snyder's film, I was genuinely excited. I really enjoy 2009's Watchmen, but I always felt that a single movie (even with an extended runtime) was not enough to showcase its complex rules and layered themes. With this series, Lindelof delivers one of the best new TV shows of the year!

Within the first six episodes, it's already remarkable what he's able to achieve. I've seen some people complaining about how political the season is... You do know we're discussing Watchmen, right? Both the comic and film are packed with politics and social messages relevant to this day and age. So, obviously, the TV series is also heavily centered around a political tone, and it's handled beautifully. Nowadays, it's challenging to produce anything that addresses sensitive issues because, well, people get offended pretty easily. Having in mind the opening sequence of the pilot (so brutal), it's undeniable that the show is incredibly brave in tackling historical moments in a fictional work.

While Snyder's style is occasionally present, the graphic novel has a tremendous impact on the series regarding its references and story. By now, the first episode has already aired, so you already have at least one hint of where the show might be placed in time and space. What I love the most about this season is undoubtedly its storytelling structure. Lindelof borrows his own tricks from Lost and uses the back-and-forward way of telling how the action is happening. This non-linear chronology of events generates tons of questions that are answered in innovative, intelligent, and twisty plot points.

I would say that the first two chapters ask more than explain, but from the third episode onwards, all have significant revelations (and a few more questions). Some are completely unexpected and shocking. Others may be predictable but are told through a unique perspective. Every time I finished an episode, I wanted the ""Next Episode"" button to click on (fortunately for me, I did have that button). This desire not only has to do with the captivating screenplay, but with the fully-developed, compelling characters. In the same way that the movie wasn't a generic superhero flick, this series deals with more profound thematics.

Regina King is a total badass as Sister Night, but it's Angela Abar who makes the viewer care about her. From her life principles to her strong personality, she has everything a protagonist needs. King shines in a few emotionally powerful scenes, but her action sequences are also impressive. Yes, let me get this out of the way: there's more than enough fights. If I'm not mistaken, every single episode has at least a couple of great action scenes. A few long takes, some excellent choreography, but just like the source material, Watchmen isn't about the (cool) fights.

Every character is really well-developed. From their backstory to their desires, everyone gets a good chunk of runtime, including the seemingly secondary characters. No one is ""just there"". Everyone has a role to play either in the intriguing plot or in the eventually important mysterious side stories. Jeremy Irons is phenomenal as Adrian Veidt, and I recommend patience and tons of attention to his story that seems isolated. It's probably the most puzzling subplot of the show. Jean Smart shares the lead torch with King from the third episode on, by portraying someone we all know and love. Once again, the casting is perfect, as well as her outstanding performance.

Tim Blake Nelson does a great job with the most fascinating secondary character, Looking Glass. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II doesn't have much to do as Angela's husband, Cal Abar, but he still offers a grounded display. Finally, Louis Gossett Jr gives the fitting mysterious vibe to ""the wheelchair guy"". Damon Lindelof doesn't hold back when it comes to reference other works. Easter Eggs to both the film and comic are spread across the entire season. He always hides a few critical elements to the plot in the background or even in plain sight (someone's secretary or office), so be sure to keep your eyes wide open.

Technically, I have to praise the costume design, which offers some awesome superhero outfits. I love how CGI-less the series is as well. There are tons of practical effects, the production design is astonishing, and the use of real sets delivers that realism that a green screen can never get quite right. The score is addictive and even helpful to understand where the story might be going (if you've seen the first episode, you should research where the title card came from).

Watchmen is one of the best TV shows to premiere this year. Its pilot resembles Lost's, where dozens of questions are asked, and barely any answer is given. So far, I only have one minor issue with one of the subplots that doesn't seem to be developing at the same pace or with the same concern as the rest. Everything else is pretty much seamless. From the phenomenal casting to the exceptionally well-developed, compelling characters, Damon Lindelof is able to deliver yet another fantastic TV series. The technical quality is impeccable as expected, but it's the original take on a post-Watchmen (comic/movie) through an incredibly captivating storytelling structure that impresses me the most. If you're a fan of Snyder's film or the comic, definitely don't miss this show! If you have no past experience with this world, then this series won't stop to explain to you what happened or how things got where they're at.

**Final Thoughts (based on the remaining episodes and the entire season):**

I never thought I would be re-reading my original review, and laugh so much at myself for thinking certain characters or particular subplots wouldn't have that much interest or impact in the narrative. My only issue concerning the first six episodes revolved around a subplot involving Lady Trieu (Hong Chau), which I found to be slowly developing, and it was the only story I wasn't able to fit with the others. So, my overall opinion on the season would heavily depend on how the last three episodes tie everything together...

Damon Lindelof is a genius. You know when something is so incredible that we start getting a bit angry because of how flawless it is? That's me on the penultimate chapter, A God Walks into Abar. It's one of the best episodes based on exposition in the history of television! Looking back, I can now affirm that every single shot matters. Every line of dialogue, every tiny little detail. If Game of Thrones ditched tons of narratives and prophecies in its last season, Watchmen does the exact opposite: it literally ties every thread, big or small, together in a seamless fashion.

If you are part of the group of people who gave up on the first episodes due to their ambiguousness, then you missed the answers to the questions that made you quit. You missed one of the best-written seasons ever. Patience is a virtue, and everyone should go back and watch the whole show before jumping to impulsive decisions. I promise: every single story makes sense, and all are blended together in the most perfect, mind-blowing, entertaining way possible. From the wheelchair old man to the whereabouts of Dr. Manhattan or Adrian Veidt, you won't be disappointed. The ending will generate discourse for years or at least until an inevitable (?) second season.

If, after six episodes, I couldn't wholly assert that Damon Lindelof delivered one of the best TV shows of the year, now I can. Watchmen is not only the best TV series of 2019, but it's one of the best debut seasons I've ever witnessed. From its jaw-dropping writing to the outstanding performances, it possesses more than just a couple of near-perfect episodes. It might scare some people off due to its initial vagueness, but the last episodes compensate the time spent thinking about the numerous questions. If you're a fan of the graphic novel or of Zack Snyder's film, you need to experience this TV adaptation. Just make sure you have previous knowledge of this world because Lindelof doesn't stop to introduce anyone to how things work...

>_The first thing I saw in the moonlight was the placard with its legend in large, block letters: ""I defiled my race."" Above the placard leered the horribly bloated, purplish face of a young woman, her eyes wide open and bulging, her mouth agape. Finally I could make out the thin, vertical line of rope disappearing into the branches above. Apparently the rope had slipped a bit or the branch to which it was tied had sagged, until the woman's feet were resting on the pavement, giving the_ _uncanny appearance of a corpse standing upright of its own volition._

Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, _Watchmen_ was published by DC Comics in 12 issues in 1986 and 1987. Knowing absolutely nothing of comics, I was completely unaware of its existence until 2005, when it placed on _TIME_'s ""100 Best English-Language Novels (1923-2005)"". The mere fact that it appeared on such a list, alongside such titans as William Faulkner's _The Sound and the Fury_ (1929), Thomas Pynchon's _Gravity's Rainbow_ (1973), and Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ (1987), was enough to pique my curiosity and so I read it, and I liked it a great deal. Its deconstruction of the superhero genre is brilliantly handled, dismantling and interrogating virtually every generic trope so as to question the very purpose of such stories even as it exists as an example of one. At the same time, its depiction of Cold War paranoia and condemnation of right-wing idolatry are front and centre without ever seeming forced. Moore himself considers the comic ""unfilmable"", and several prominent directors had tried and failed (Terry Gilliam in 1991, Darren Aronofsky in 2004, and Paul Greengrass in 2006). However, in 2009, it finally reached the screen, directed by Zack Snyder...and the less we say about that, the better. The film recounts the plot well, but it has none of the thematic nuance or subtle genre-interrogation. All of which brings us to HBO's new limited series. Created by showrunner Damon Lindelof (co-creator of the TV game-changer that was _Lost_ and the seminal existential masterwork that was _The Leftovers_), this was actually HBO's third attempt to create a _Watchman_ series under Lindelof's guidance, but he turned down both of their previous offers (in 2010 and 2013). The most significant thing about this particular adaptation, however, is that it isn't an adaptation; it's an original story which serves as a pseudo-sequel, taking place 33 years after the events of the comic, and featuring some (but not all) of the surviving characters, mixed with plenty of new blood. As expected, Moore refused to participate in the production in any way, but Gibbons was very much on-board throughout.

But is the show any good? Well, it's not as good as _The Leftovers_ (what is?), but it is an exceptional piece of work, and literally gets better with each episode, culminating in a one-two combo of uncharacteristic emotional power, with the last two episodes being as good a couple of hours of TV as you're ever likely to see. The acting is immense, the writing is incisive and challenging, the aesthetic is stunning, and the show was a worthy winner of no less than 11 Emmys from its 26 nominations, including ""Outstanding Limited Series"", ""Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie"" (Regina King), ""Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie "" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), ""Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Damon Lindelof and Cord Jefferson for ""This Extraordinary Being""), ""Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Gregory Middleton for ""This Extraordinary Being""), and ""Outstanding Musical Composition for a Limited Series or Movie"" (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for ""It's Summer and We're Running Out of Ice""). All in all, _Watchmen_ is that rarest of beasts – a show which lives up to the hype.

Familiarity with the plot of the original isn't a requirement so as to appreciate the sequel, as you're given all the world-building back-info you need, but it can certainly help you get the most out of Lindelof's intricate narrative and thematic tapestry, especially in the earlier episodes. The world of Watchmen is a slightly different version of our world, with the major point of departure coming with the publication of Issue #1 of _Action Comics_ in June 1938, which introduced Superman to the world, and brought the still-in-its-infancy superhero genre into the mainstream cultural lexicon. In the world of the comic, unlike in the real world, this leads to the rise of ""costumed adventurers""; ordinary people without any special powers who take to the streets to fight crime and corruption. The only person with genuine superpowers emerges in 1959 – nuclear physicist Dr. John Osterman is apparently killed in an Intrinsic Field Subtractor accident, only to return as Doctor Manhattan, a god-like being with immense quantum powers including clairvoyance, chronokinesis, dimensional travel, precognition, self-regeneration, subatomic manipulation, telekinesis, and teleportation. He also experiences time non-linearly, with every moment of his existence (past and future) happening at once. Due primarily to the involvement of Manhattan, the US win the Vietnam War, gaining a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, and leading to an escalation of nuclear tensions. Over the years, however, the public come to lose faith in adventurers and in 1977, the Keene Act outlaws all costumed adventurers except those sanctioned by the government, of which there were very few.

As the comic begins, it is 1985, and Richard Nixon is in his fifth term as president, having abolished the 22nd Amendment in the wake of victory in Vietnam (Edward Blake, a government-sanctioned adventurer known as The Comedian, ensured all evidence of Watergate was destroyed before it was made public and also carried out the Nixon-ordered assassination of JFK). When Manhattan is inaccurately accused of causing cancer, he exiles himself to Mars and washes his hands of humanity. As the US depend upon him as a nuclear deterrent, his departure throws the geopolitical sphere into chaos. However, as Walter Kovacs (an adventurer named Rorschach) begins an investigation into a possible conspiracy to kill former adventurers, Laurie Juspeczyk (Silk Spectre) is able to convince Manhattan to return to Earth. Meanwhile, Rorschach uncovers evidence which suggests the ""smartest man in the world"", Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias), may be behind the conspiracy. He confronts Veidt, who explains his plan to save humanity from nuclear war by faking an alien invasion, which he hopes will unite the superpowers against a perceived common enemy. Rorschach vows to stop him, but Veidt reveals that he has already enacted his plan – a giant squid supposedly from another dimension (but really just a genetically engineered earth squid), has emerged in New York unleashing a ""psychic shockwave"" which has wiped out half the city's inhabitants (around three million people). Rorschach insists he will reveal the truth, but is confronted by Manhattan who argues that such a truth can only hurt humanity. Rorschach, however, refuses to listen, and Manhattan is forced to kill him to keep Veidt's actions secret. The comic ends with a copy of Rorschach's journal, which explains Veidt's plan in detail, reaching the far-right publication _New Frontiersman_, with the journal placed in the ""crank file"" for possible future publication.

And so we arrive at the TV show. 

Tulsa, OK, 2018; the preceding 33 years have seen a series of dramatic change in the world of _Watchmen_. Veidt's plan worked perfectly, and the US and Soviets formed an alliance to guard against the possibility of another 'invasion'. Rorschach's journal was published by the _New Frontiersman_, but has been dismissed as a hoax ever since, with only the far-right and conspiracy theorists believing it authentic. Meanwhile, white supremacist groups have been on the rise, and after an incident in Tulsa where almost the entire police department was wiped out in a coordinated attack by a KKK off-shoot known as the Seventh Kavalry, a law is passed that allows police to wear masks and remain anonymous. There are even certain police officers who wear costumes and operate under an alias, not unlike the still-outlawed costumed adventurers of the previous century. Another important part of the make-up of law enforcement is that police officers' guns are secured in their car, and can only be released remotely, and only if the officer can justify to HQ the potential use of deadly force. Meanwhile, with Nixon now dead, a Democratic president sits in the Oval Office – former actor Robert Redford, who is currently in his seventh, and final, term, and has introduced a massive system of reparations for African-Americans whose ancestors experienced racial injustice (contemptuously called ""Redfordations"" by the right). Finally, Doctor Manhattan has returned to Mars and no longer communicates with Earth.

In essence, the story follows the fallout from a murder, which is soon discovered to be much more complex than originally thought, and could have far-reaching implications not only for Tulsa, but the entire planet. Within this _milieu_, we follow multiple characters, some new, some old. The protagonist is Angela Abar (a predictably stunning (Regina King); officially retired from Tulsa PD, Angela continues to work as the masked cop known as Sister Night. Other characters include Laurie Blake (a wonderfully acerbic Jean Smart), aka Silk Spectre, who is now an FBI agent tasked with rounding up costumed adventurers whenever they emerge; Judd Crawford (a still effortlessly-cool Don Johnson), chief of Tulsa PD; Wade Tillman (Tim Blake Nelson), a cop who works under the moniker of Looking Glass and specialises in interrogations; Will Reeves (Louis Gossett Jr. reminding us all how good he is), an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, but who seems to know a lot about a great many things; Senator Joe Keene Jr. (James Wolk), son of the senator who wrote the Keene Act, and the man mainly responsible for allowing Tulsa PD to wear masks; Lady Trieu (a brilliantly emotionless Hong Chau), the world's first ever trillionaire; Cal Abar (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), Angela's husband; Red Scare (Andrew Howard), a proudly communist member of the Tulsa PD, originally from Russia; Jane Crawford (Frances Fisher), Judd's wife; Pirate Jenny (Jessica Camacho), another costumed Tulsa police officer; Bian (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), Trieu's daughter; and Agent Dale Petey (Dustin Ingram), an expert on the history of costumed adventures who accompanies Laurie to Tulsa to investigate the murder. At the same time, we are also introduced to an unidentified man (played by Jeremy Irons, who is clearly having the time of his life) living in luxury on the grounds of a remote castle at an unknown location. So too do we meet his butler, Mr Phillips (Tom Mison) and his maid, Miss. Crookshanks (Sara Vickers). How all of this relates to what is happening in Tulsa is perhaps the show's biggest ongoing mystery (and don't expect early answers).

As with the original comic, the TV show is thematically rich. Lindelof has stated that he wanted to tackle whatever socio-political issue that was to 2019 as the Cold War was to 1985, and to him, it ""_felt like it was undeniably race and policing_"" (the fact that the show has proved so extraordinarily prophetic is essentially irrelevant to its quality, but it is amazing that here we have a show depicting African-Americans refusing to bow down to oppression that was made before the death of George Floyd, a show depicting the widespread but controversial wearing of masks that was made long before the COVID-19 pandemic was a thing). Politically then, the show does much the same thing as the comic did – it deploys a real-world socio-political problem in a not quite 1:1 fictional _milieu_. In Ronald Reagan's America, the focus was on apocalyptic Cold War paranoia, whereas in Trump's Divided States, the most pressing existential threat is the rise of right-wing extremism, with those who once remained in the shadows having been emboldened by a racist president to confidently espouse their hatred for all to see. At the same time, on the show's official podcast, Lindelof explains,

>_For_ Watchmen _to be culturally relevant in 2019, it has to be some sort of funhouse mirror reflection of the time that we're living in. There's a really fascinating conversation that erupted around the show as we were airing the first three or four episodes, which was the idea that ""this show is too political"", and also, parallel to that, how can the show call itself Watchmen. Well, the show is political, but my own personal politics, and I make no bones about the fact that I'm a liberal and very progressively minded, but at the same time, the original_ Watchmen _is kind of anarchist in its blood and it has to troll the extremes, so you have to troll extreme liberalism, extreme progressivism. I happen to think that reparations are a really good idea, whether they're reparations for slavery or reparations for something like the Tulsa Massacre. I also have to accept that were reparations actually enacted, there would be a virulent pushback from a large sector of our society. Do I take sides? Well, my side is that I think we have a big white supremacy problem in the United States of America. I'm not here saying, there's good people on both sides. That being said, I'm just presenting what I think would actually happen were reparations to be passed._

This is a key point; in a country as ideologically divided as the post-2016 United States, achieving any kind of political or cultural harmony is next to impossible, and how the show presents the reactions of right-wing characters to Redfordations reminds us of how attempts at reconciliation can often serve to force people even farther apart.

The theme of white and black and racial tension comes up time and again throughout the series. For example, the Abars have two children, although both Angela and Cal are black and the children are white – a black couple adopting white children is very rare on TV or in cinema, where the prevailing narrative trope remains that of the ""white saviour"". Another good example is that in episode seven, ""An Almost Religious Awe"", a member of Seventh Kavalry asserts that ""_white men in masks are heroes. Black men in masks are scary_"", whilst in episode nine, ""See How They Fly"", another member of the group proclaims, ""_it is extremely difficult to be a white man in America right now_"" (a hilarious, if it wasn't so dangerous, sentiment taken very much from the real world, where racists will often argue that there's no such thing as White Privilege, and those who are really oppressed are white, Christian, heterosexual males). In the same episode, speaking of President Redford and his ""libstapo"", it is stated, ""_first he took our guns. And then, he made us say sorry. Over and over again. Sorry. Sorry for the alleged sins of those who died decades before we were born. Sorry for the colour of our skin_"" (and this, obviously, ties back into the notion that Redford's attempts to heal division has led only to enhancing it).

Of course, within this, another major theme is law enforcement, with Lindelof posing the fascinating question of what happens when you mix masks with the administration of the law. The show is obsessed with law and order, and specifically how racial tensions are manifested within such a system, from literally its opening frames. As the first episode begins, we are watching _Trust in the Law_, a 1921 Oscar Micheaux film about Deputy Bass Reeves, aka The Black Marshal, the first African-American federal marshal west of the Mississippi (Bass Reeves was a real marshal and Micheaux was a real director, although _Trust in the Law_ is not a real film). The scene opens with a man in black chasing a man in white across a prairie. Reaching a church, the man in black dismounts the man in white just as the congregation emerge. The man in white is then revealed to be a local sheriff and the man in black is an African-American. The congregation immediately assume that the victim here is the white bedecked sheriff, but it quickly emerges that the sheriff is corrupt and the man in black is a marshal performing an arrest. When the congregation decide to string up the sheriff, Reeves prevents them, stating, ""_No mob justice today – trust in the law_"" (which, of course, is doubly ironic insofar as not trusting in the law is the very basis for costumed adventurers in the first place – inversion on top of inversion). After a brutal and harrowing depiction of the Tulsa Race Massacre (when white supremacists launched an attack on the predominantly black-owned Greenwood District, killing up to 300 people, injuring over 800, and torching the businesses in the area), the first scene set in 2018 depicts a masked and menacing cop pulling over a truck and exchanging a few words with the nervous driver. However, again, the colours are inverted – the cop is black and the driver is white. These two scenes form a beautiful bit of visual story-telling, establishing immediately the centrality of racial tensions, conveying that such things are often more complex than they appear (there is no fixed black and white), and that the show plans to upend and invert common tropes. 

A third major theme is trauma. The core purpose of Redfordations is to address and acknowledge generational trauma, but many of the characters are wrestling with much more private and personal traumas, which, to one extent or another, have come to define who they are. Angela and Judd, for example, carry with them the trauma of surviving the Seventh Kavalry's massacre of Tulsa PD; Cal carries with him the trauma of an unspecified accident several years earlier that left him with partial amnesia; Looking Glass carries the trauma of being in New York when the squid attacked, and has become paranoid about the possibility of something similar happening again; Laurie carries the trauma of her family history (her father was the masked adventurer The Comedian, who raped her mother, Sally Jupiter, aka. the first Silk Spectre, although Laurie was the product of a later, consensual, relationship between the two) and a failed past romance with Manhattan which colours everything in her present; Will carries the trauma of witnessing the Tulsa Race Massacre. 

As thematically rich as the show is, however, one cannot help also admiring its aesthetic, with the structure of each episode serving as a subtle nod to the structure of the comic. Instead of panels of various sizes, the comic was primarily structured by way of a grid of nine panels of the same size on each page. The middle two pages differed, featuring three panels on the outside edge of each page, and half of a larger picture per page, thus the two pages acted as structural mirrors to one another. This symmetricality is replicated in the show insofar as each episode features opening and closing scenes which mirror one another. So, for example, one episode begins with leaflets falling from the sky, and ends with a car rising into the sky; another begins with a couple patiently awaiting something that may not happen, and ends with two different people awaiting something that definitely will happen; another opens with a busload of people bringing a message of life, and ends with a van of people bringing death.

It's also worth noting how the show-within-the-show is presented. Within the _Watchmen milieu_, _America Hero Story_, an affectionate reference to Ryan Murphy, is a hugely popular TV show about the Minutemen, a group of costumed adventurers formed in 1939 by Nelson Gardner (Captain Metropolis), Silk Spectre, and Spectre's agent Laurence Schexnayder. We see several extracts from the show, but none are more eye-catching than the scene in episode three, which depicts the first time Hooded Justice (the first costumed adventurer) foiled a crime. This scene is staged as an elaborate over-the-top action sequence with a quite ridiculous amount of unjustified and unnecessary slow-motion (mixed in with fast transitions and regular speed footage). Sound familiar? If you've seen any of Snyder's films, you'll recognise the style – and if you've seen his adaptation of _Watchmen_, you'll immediately see why _American Hero Story_ was shot this way. For me, the main reason the 2009 film failed was that style was far more important than theme, often to the point of undermining that theme. These characters are not supposed to be noble and badass action heroes whom we admire for their toughness and bravery. Quite the contrary. Yet in Snyder's film, characters who are supposed to represent the utter unworkability of heroes in the real world and illustrate how human foibles will always destroy idealism are shown having elaborately choreographed slow-motion brawls set to a thumping score and frenetically edited. The style is literally contradicting the theme – it's amateur hour 101 and smacks of someone who responds to the coolness of the comic's visual design, but understands none of the underlying context. Thankfully, Lindelof most definitely does understand that context, and it's that understanding which makes the _American Hero Story_ scenes so funny.

The aesthetic is also impressive on its own terms, particularly the cinematography and editing, and I'd be remiss here not to mention episodes six and eight. Directed by executive producer Stephen Williams, ""This Extraordinary Being"" is shot primarily in black and white, and takes place in the 30s and 40s, with the cinematography by Gregory Middleton, nothing short of exemplary. Employing the odd bit of colour here and there within the black and white photography to focus our attention on particular objects, there is also an extraordinary 4-minute single shot which goes in and out of several buildings, features a plethora of extras, some VFX, and a lot of SFX. Stunning stuff. As for ""A God Walks Into Abar"" (as good an episode of TV as you could ever imagine), all I can say is this: if you're interested in learning about editing, watch this episode. Directed by head director and executive producer Nicole Kassell and cut by Henk Van Eeghan, the episode essentially tries to give a visual representation of how Doctor Manhattan experiences time – with every moment in his experience all happening at once, so he can 'remember' things that haven't happened yet, or be 'within' multiple memories from the past all at the same time. It's a spellbinding exercise in stylistic control. The editing (and writing) are so tight, and the time jumps so absolutely flawless, folding organically into one another to form a single cohesive template, it's some of the finest editing I've ever seen.

_Watchmen_ is an exceptionally good show. By default, of course, there will be fans of the comic who'll dislike it on principle. There will also be those who accuse it of pandering to a liberal PC agenda (look at the negative (and frankly, hilarious) review bombing on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes), and there'll be those who simply don't like the idea of a _Watchman_ TV show with a black woman at its centre. Make no mistake, however, this show has been put together by people who know, appreciate, love, and understand the comic. Thematically complex, aesthetically breathtaking, brilliantly acted, _Watchmen_ is an exceptional piece of television.","Regina King, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Irons, Jean Smart, Tom Mison",0.0,False,0.0,2019.0

If so, Time Force is one of the strongest seasons, but then again, it's so similar to the slightly superior Timeranger that maybe something like Lost Galaxy is more valuable.

Do we judge quality overall, even when seasons can be easily ignored? If so, Power Rangers is pretty bad. But then again, so is The Simpsons.

As of this comment I have yet to play the actual game that this Amazon Prime Cartoon is based off of. I honestly feel that there are better Cartoons and even Animated Movies that are centered around Halloween or Mysterious spooky places that have done better job at making a fully realized worlds than this show does. However, I still have to give ""Costume Quest"" Credit that it does everything it can to make something engaging and adventurous for it's intended audience. It's a very creative concept and It makes decent use of it's characters and even a little of it's world building. I enjoyed watching it overall and If there is a Second Season in the works, I would be down for it

saved by the bell: the new class,"Saved by the Bell: The New Class is a spin-off of the Saved by the Bell series which ran from September 11, 1993 to January 8, 2000. The series lasted for seven seasons on NBC as a part of the network's TNBC Saturday morning line-up. It was the fourth incarnation of the franchise.

The show had the same concept as the original series but featured a new group of students now roaming the halls of the fictional Bayside High School. Mr. Belding, played by Dennis Haskins, remained as the school's principal. Many of the stories were recycled plots of its parent series. The first season cast included Robert Sutherland Telfer, Jonathan Angel, Isaac Lidsky, Natalia Cigliuti, Bianca Lawson, and Bonnie Russavage. Unlike the original series, which featured very few major cast changes throughout its run, The New Class regularly changed its core cast with Mr. Belding being the only constant factor.

The series was universally panned by critics and most fans of the original series and is one of the worst reviewed teen shows, but had a positive reception to new fans of the franchise.","Family, Comedy",5.7,3.9541817061584545,3.6635616461296463,False,Ended,1.9459101490553132,4.962844630259907,3.4011973816621555,Amazon Prime Video,No reviews,"Dennis Haskins, Dustin Diamond, Lindsey McKeon, Ashley Tesoro, Tom Wade Huntington",0.0,False,0.0,1993.0

aladdin,"Aladdin is an animated television series made by Walt Disney Television which aired from 1994 to 1995, based on the original 1992 feature. It was animated at the Slightly Offbeat Productions Studios in Penrose, Auckland, New Zealand. Coming on the heels of the direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar, the series picked up where that installment left off, with Aladdin now living in the palace, engaged to beautiful and spunky Princess Jasmine. ""Al"" and Jasmine went together into peril among sorcerers, monsters, thieves, and more. Monkey sidekick Abu, the animated Magic Carpet, and the fast-talking, shape-shifting Genie came along to help, as did sassy, complaining parrot Iago, formerly Jafar’s pet but now an antihero. Jafar, having previously been destroyed in the second movie, returns in only one episode which also serves as a crossover with Hercules: The Animated Series.","Action & Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Kids",6.899,3.951070626678811,5.814130531825066,False,Ended,1.0986122886681098,4.454347296253507,3.091042453358316,No platforms available,"""Aladdin and the King of Thieves"" serves as the third installment in the Aladdin franchise, predating the live-action adaptation. Despite my deep affection for Aladdin and Jasmine, this animated film falls short and undermines the franchise's outstanding qualities.

While the storyline introduces Aladdin's father, adding an interesting layer to the narrative, the animation quality leaves much to be desired. The visuals come across as subpar, reminiscent of content from the Disney Channel rather than a theatrical release. Despite this, the return of Robin Williams as the genie is a bright spot in the film.

Despite its flaws, I appreciate this chapter in Aladdin's story and the continuation of the characters' journeys. The inclusion of Aladdin's father and the development of other villains enrich the overall narrative. While I cherish the Aladdin story and its expansion, from a cinematic perspective, this particular installment falls short.

Shifting focus to the Aladdin television series, I find it remarkable that viewers were able to further explore the characters beyond the original films. The series provided an opportunity to delve into various storylines and adventures, offering a more in-depth look at the beloved characters.

As a fan of the animated series, which also stemmed from a video game, I have a deep appreciation for the entire Aladdin franchise. The series, in particular, holds a special place in my heart as it allowed for continued engagement with these beloved characters and storylines. Aladdin remains one of my favorite characters, and the series will forever hold a special significance for me.","Scott Weinger, Linda Larkin, Dan Castellaneta, Gilbert Gottfried, Frank Welker",0.0,False,0.0,1994.0

I work with that and for the most part I don't care, and this seemed like it wanted to be a Tarantino flick and we all know how he treats history. So I came into it with the assumption that the history was going to be hysterically wrong... and I wasn't disappointed here.

But I am also a huge Pacino fan, and I am a huge Tarantino fan and I was super excited about this because it looked like a fun Tarantino knock off. That is kind of how it bills itself.

But the honest fact is, Hunters is just all over the place. I think it seriously wanted to be in a Tarantino vein, but like ""2 Days in the Valley"" it doesn't exactly understand how to Tarantino makes it work.

It doesn't know how to be funny and violent without being all over the place. It doesn't really know how to make the characters and plots intersect on more than the most base of levels, it doesn't know how to make the violence fun and amusing, and that makes all the other humor fall short and feel out of place.

And then it does the Peele political thing, and I was really hoping that it wouldn't given the vibe it was going for in the advertisements... but it did, so on top of being all over the place, if you are white you are a Nazi and evil. And, honestly, I am tired of that and pretty sure that once this woke nonsense ends and it no longer becomes hip to be openly bigoted, like the rest of his films it's going to be seen as racist.","Logan Lerman, Jerrika Hinton, Lena Olin, Carol Kane, Josh Radnor",0.0,False,0.0,2020.0

Even Scooby Doo and 13 Ghost, which was weird, is still 1000 times better than this.

Like Velma beliving in ""Early piratetism"", are f--k--g kidding me, so stupid.

Do not see this!!

**Instead** go watch any other Scooby Doo. | I was expecting to hate this like every other human being  who even as so looked at this. I'm mean the art style really gave off that Family Guy/American Dad energy and I just thought it was just gonna be more family-friendly version of those shows. But after watching all of it, it's easily in my top 3 Scooby-Doo series.

I remember when this came out, everybody online threw fits and called the show terrible. My theory for how it got so much hate on release can be boiled down to 2 reasons. First and foremost is the art style. Yeah its not that great and I guess people just assumed the same thing I did before I even watch it. Second thing is that it came right after Mystery Incorporated and I guess people got mad that it wasn't as smart or nuanced as Mystery Inc., evening we were pretty spoiled to get that show in the first place and just hated it without giving a proper chance. Listen this show and Mystery Inc. are 2 wildly different shows and trying to judge this show with Mystery Inc. as you're basis is pretty dumb. Like judge this show for it is, not for what it isn't.

I kept waiting for the show dip in quality or become less and less funny later on, but anything it got better has it went on. One thing I like about this show are the new characterizations for the gang. Fred was shockingly really good. I like how he's more of the straight man and has to try to lead all these weirdos who don't even listen to him. He might just be my favorite iteration of the character in a comedic context and as much as I love Mystery Inc.'s Fred, I don't think he would really work in this context because everybody would a weirdo. Daphne in this is undoubtedly the best incarnation of her character. I mean what competition is there. Mystery Inc. Daphne's entire character is just fantasizing over Fred and doesn't really have anything else going for her. In this however, she's fun and kooky, something I wanted for this piece of cardboard of a character. I enjoyed most of  her gimmicks and very little of them were actually annoying. I wish I had someone like Be Cool Daphne in my life. Velma was also very entertaining. I love how she's the Meg equivalent in this show and constantly gets tortured for just existing like when everybody jumps on her back and she just has to carry everybody. Shaggy and Scooby are the ones who have changed the least out of the  others, but I still get laugh out of them every once in awhile

I've been watching much Scooby-Doo content and to find a show that's at least 70% enjoyable is practically a miracle. Not every joke lands and I didn't feel like a full episode needed to be 22-minutes and it probably be more favorable if they opted 2 11-minute segments. Also when they try to add more story driven elements in the last few episodes feels a bit disingenuous because they didn't do the work for setting up a compelling story (like Mystery Inc. and Rise of the TMNT for example) and feels a bit tacked on. But there's plenty of other episodes that are really good episodes with mysteries I didn't see coming, probably because i'm losing my edge with this guessing game. 

So yeah, pretty good show and definitely the most over-hated piece of Scooby-Doo media ever made. I can see why people might dislike, but if people actually consider this worse than ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue!"", turn out you're location I just wanna talk | No, this is NOT Scooby-Doo.

Fred isn't really Fred, Velma isn't Velma, Shaggy and Scooby are hardly the cowards with the bottomless stomachs they used to be, Daphne is not Daphne...

...And there aren't any real mysteries.

You're watching another cartoon about a group of kids that just have fun, face no real threats, have nothing really scary happen to them, the series sucks.

It feel like EVERY other cartoon, straight down to animation that makes Hanna-Barbara look like Michelangelo.

The laughs keep coming and as time goes on they occasionally dip into physical comedy, which Melissa McCarthy is very good at. 

Chuck Lorre is one of the writers of the show. He was a writer for another good show, Mom. If the show had just gone for three seasons, I would have rated it as one of the best in many years. At the beginning of season 4 (I think it was) there was a message on screen stating they hoped the viewers liked the new direction of the show.

They had Molly quit her job as a teacher. Fine. Shake things up a little bit. But alarm bells sort of when off when she decides to become a writer, because I knew immediately she would become successful at it in almost no time. That is the rule for television characters becoming writers.(but oddly enough not as much with movies.” I guess it is because these shows are written by successful writers. No doubt I am merely horribly bitter because I have written novels my entire life and not reached Molly’s level of success after a year or less. There was also some other predictable events. Still, even with those minor reservations, it is well worth watching.","Billy Gardell, Melissa McCarthy, Reno Wilson, Swoosie Kurtz, Katy Mixon",1.0,True,2.0,2010.0

Not for those who've been there and certainly not for people who think socialism is a bad word. It shows what you get when you build a social safety net, which assumes it's going to be abused by people who don't need it. It shows that people who work in the system, know that asking for help for those really in need, means showing up.

That they already had a long fight behind them and plenty more battles ahead of them and that you need to nudge them to accept help. Push them over the numerous little hurdles that society has created for them, being fully aware that they may not make it this time.

The series stands out in it's little quirks, like the ammount of cash available, the substitution of legal jargon with the word ""legal"" and Alex lying at the bottom of a pit. It brilliantly conveighs the state of mind. How Alex perceives things. How somebody in that situation, has to deal with all of society's bullshit.

The second thing that stood out, is how Sean can be a really likeable, stand-up guy at times. If you've ever wondered why abused spouces go back, this is the one to watch. If you've ever wondered if you're really an ""abused person"", if they never hit you - again, this is the one to watch.

But, make no mistake: it is very hard to watch at times, because it has little ups and deep downs. And the hard thing is that you care enough about Alex and Maddy that you _don't_ want to see happening, what you see unfolding and know _is_ going to happen. But stick with it. If only, to enrich your soul. | Another stupid American show with its racism problems and stupidity. Only shows like these you hear offending and racist words like ""white trash"" coming out from a white person's mouth (to make them even dumber) and words like that normalized in their society, sadly shows how racist US became towards white people... But besides this ugly reality that show shows us, main character is very stupid, making mistakes after mistakes and never learning her lessons. You watch it and think ""why the heck did she do this?"". She is so stupid, that this show will leave you frustrated. | Maid is a solid, heartfelt drama that offers an honest look at resilience and survival, though it doesn’t always hit the mark.

Created by Molly Smith Metzler, the series follows Alex, portrayed by Margaret Qualley, whose performance brings vulnerability and strength to the character, making her journey relatable and engaging. The direction and production are thoughtfully executed, with a careful attention to detail that adds depth, but the series occasionally falters with its lengthy episodes, leading the pacing to feel stretched.

While Maid doesn’t reach the level of a truly standout series, it’s a well-crafted, empathetic story that resonates, making it worth the watch for fans of character-driven drama.","Margaret Qualley, Nick Robinson, Andie MacDowell, Rylea Nevaeh Whittet",0.0,False,0.0,2021.0

It could’ve been left after the first season and it would’ve been remembered as a better show than it ended up being.

The next two seasons just unraveled with huge holes in the plot and introducing new characters that were really irrelevant.
The series was scheduled to be a 7 season show but expenses with shooting in the Keys was too costly.

The choice of actors, sets and the general vibe of the series closely and in my view wisely, mirrors the film. That said, as might be expected the story diverges but its general direction is unconvincing. 

Why, for example, would an isolationist ex CIA operative rely on the very organisation he betrayed arrange his escape and that of Hanna? Especially given the emphasis he places on independence and a ""trust no one"" mentality? Not to mention his extensive contacts. 

Its these flaws the pull this series down to a degree which is a shame as it captures the discordant, unsettling atmosphere of the original movie nicely.

SEASON 01:

I neither read the book nor I knew the story. So this was a surprise mini-series. As far I've heard, this one was the finest adaptation. The best ever cast and the episodes were well split with each one had a great opening and the ending. The suspense kept me alive till the final episode, final scene. Meanwhile, I made some guesses, but most of them did not happen. In my opinion, it should have been a feature film duology. Then it would have been considered one of the best film series, as well as mystery film. And the Oscars, Golden Globes would have poured in. Now it got record 14 Emmy nods and I'm waiting for the result.

Well, it all started as a normal drama about the mothers whose children are in the same school, same class. The real story kick starts when a boy who recently moved into the town with his single mother was accused of bullying a classmate girl. So the mothers gang splits up on that issue, but it seems not much affecting the children, particularly those are involved in the it. As the story progresses and episodes to come, lots of mysteries revealed about those mothers and their personal life, as well as the recent past secrets. But how it all comes to end truck with a sudden and powerful twist.

All the big screen stars foraying into the small screen were the big advantage. That's why I said it should have been a big screen film. Each one had scope for their roles. It was well balanced characters, that makes hard to predict any one direction where the story could head. From the director of 'Dallas Buyers Club' and many awesome flicks. I hope it returns for the second season, which has a very slim chance. From the locations to the musics, I loved it. A perfect mystery-drama. Everyone should see this, even if those are not into the television series. I almost gave it out of out.

The series centered on Ellen's dealing with her quirky friends, her family and the problems of daily life. The series is notable for being the first one in which the main character came out as gay, which DeGeneres' character did in the 1997 episode ""Puppy Episode"". This event received a great deal of media exposure, ignited controversy, and prompted ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode.

The series' theme song, ""So Called Friend"" is by Scottish band Texas. A running gag was that each episode had a distinct opening credits sequence, resulting from Ellen's ongoing search for the perfect opening credits.","Comedy, Talk",6.25,3.855367994271567,3.871201010907891,False,Ended,1.6094379124341003,4.6913478822291435,3.4011973816621555,Disney Plus,No reviews,"Ellen DeGeneres, Joely Fisher, David Anthony Higgins, Clea Lewis, Jeremy Piven",1.0,True,3.0,1994.0

With room for character development, good believable decision making and more than enough screen presence to carry the whole thing. But then the surprising plot twist hits the audience hard. The charismatic blogger is not the lead after all. Instead we should care for the hard to look at little girl, who's adult version is clearly a different person with a similarly uninteresting face.

Not one single character was likeable or possessed any redeeming features. In fact, each was a one dimensional cardboard cut-out.

The protagonist was simply irritating and I was hoping that she would just stay dead and not come back, to be honest. It was all just so pretentious, badly executed and not a patch on Groundhog Day, which grabs you from the start and is also very humorous.
This is neither humorous or hooks you, at least for me. | There is a great temptation, which many succumb to, to not only compare this series to Groundhog Day, but to rate it according to how they believe Russian Doll fared “against” Groundhog Day. Indeed, leading up to watch it, based on the previews, I was thinking in those terms. But I was mistaken to fall into that trap.

Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy, played almost entirely for laughs. There is an obvious comparison to be made here, with the protagonist (plural in Russian Doll) reliving the same day over and over again. But I felt Russian Doll had more depth. It wasn’t just magic like it was in Groundhog Day that caused their day to re-start every time they fell asleep at midnight or died (mostly by suicide) to escape the magic setting. In Russian Doll they had to navigate a dangerous landscape that seemed out to kill them.

Nadia is not a warm and fuzzy character at the outset, but I liked her wit and energy. If a male character acted like she did, I think the critique level would be less rabid. Heck, I felt it in myself until I challenged it. But as the series progressed, she developed as a person, gaining more depth, adjusting her behaviors. Hints developed that suggested that stuff from her past were playing into what was going on, and who she was inside. There were hints of explanations behind the strange phenomena, which Groundhog Day didn’t try for, such as the theory Of multiplayer universes in physics, which I don’t think I personally believe in but which I leave to the scientists.

I don’t want to give much away, so I will stop there. I think Russian Doll is imaginative with a lead character who is not easy to like, at least at first, but for whom the writer(s) were not afraid to put in some work to help us like her. I have no idea where they can go with the second series: a repeat of the same format seems unlikely, but I trust to their powers of imagination that they will push the envelope once again, and I will at the very least take it for a spin and see if I also like the sophomore series. | First season is one of the most captivating shows I have watched, starting with the main characters and plot that never completely crystallises, but makes openings for theories to be made by the viewer. Natasha Lyonne creates a multifaceted, captivating character that is not fuzzy or particularly humorous, which could also be said for the show itself. Comparing it to a romcom like Groundhog Day is as irrelevant as comparing any other Romantic Comedy to a Mystery Thriller or Drama. They are not in the same league, and they never strived to be.","Natasha Lyonne, Charlie Barnett, Greta Lee, Chloë Sevigny, Elizabeth Ashley",1.0,True,3.0,2019.0

**epidode 2** gives you cinematic high not available in half of the popular series or movies available i the market. One of the strongest episode visually, with breathtaking imagery.

**Episode 3**: After the high of second episode, this episode forms a narrative key for our  way fwd, as all the characters are now put in perfect places to reach the enivatble conclusion due for the ned of season one, though, as a narrative this chapter truly reflects on one character, while oue titular character is just cool stoic badass. The ch primarily serves uses tried and tested tope to achieve the two things a.) seting up the villan and b) recrruiting allie, philosophy of sword and dialogue are strong as always but overall it is worst of the three, with imagery still better than run of the mill shows, but it is overshadowed by the highs of t=its  own benchmarks 4/5 Highlight akemi and his servant talking about destny and seeing reality as is. akemi decision to to conflict uncertainity; truly powerful, yet arguably foolish stuff.

**Episode 4:**  Best part of the episode is the addition of madam e of the brothel for various intrestes into the cast, shejjust drops truth bombs evreywhere.Best philosopher on the episode till now. The brothel in itself is a unique , place while watching it came to my understanding how differntly we see sex fm that in japan. Moreover I loved how the story is taking these detour , normally I would be pissed but here it makes the story all the more wonderful. the camerawork is dynamic, little flourisjhes like painiting of blood and killing of the bird are nice flourishes , that both symblically signifies the character and their ruthlessness for their goal, It beautifuly belances the strange dichotomy o the protagonists. It is here I also comes to understand how at each episode fm second ch our character is provided with various questions in these detour which shows their character in front of seemingly nothing burd=ger for them in their goal. Making Mizu atypical of powerful male fantasy enhances her character. Iloving these detours througly 4.75/5 (as it nitself is not a satisffying arc , if it hasd a better stand alone story, The ch in itself would have been a  10/10 worthy for its screen play, dialogue delivery. art direction, and memorable imagery esp that last 10 minutes sequence)

**Episode 5:** First off, I forgot the villain monologue last ch that was shakespearian. Moving on Thiis episode had the best god damn naative tghroughlin eand felt like culmination of everrything I havebeen pointing out through out previous episode. Though vosuals were stilll beautiful , but the close quarter fights while tense and interesting  gets tedious after a while. Ending of the narrative was beautiful. Though its visual opf past were not as effective as episode two neither the fight were as dynamic as in those episode , it is more than made up by the narrative thrust of the episode . Overall Better than anyother episode so far 5+/5

**Episode 6:** What is with this series , by the 20 min mark it was going to be another mindless action jhon wick with artistic flair, but the confrontation with villain made me rethink the whole episode in retrospect. The theme that is prevalent in this episode is the madma line of desire in ep4 and the theme I Ignored in epidode 5 i.e, expectations of others a v/s perception of self and how both shapes on one another. This ch carrries fwd previous ch theme and give us a narrative pay off as our blue eyed boy is healing while not giving up on their goal. How is this going to patyout nobody understand. WHile I can be sure that The samurai have much more ground to cover. As the way fwd seems bleak. Narratively it is a perfect end , but it still caught me by surprise as I have ecome too used to trash in my media consumption. 4/5

**Episode 7:** One of the best fucking penultimate episode; parallel between feamle leads are drawn , final battle lines are drawn, and we have the final twist reveal, though I don't consider the villan  a""villain"" to me he sounds like a chaotically neutral person, even benevolent to their own family, The use of voillain bgm , is effective is shocking us, but it doesn't convince me he is a villain but an opporunist. Similarly I don't know what is the stance of shogun wether he iois tyraant ior benevolent ruler or neutral. He doesn't apppear to be anything truly and that is why my sympathy for oplan is directed more twds akemi rather than shogun family, similarly my sympathy is for blue eyed samurai , becoz if he fails he will, have much harder time conquering jap. But even then execllent ch, with beautiful bird imagery of running princess being the highlight. Though still a notch less than the best ch of the series. Ah and did I discuss how gr8 is the primary antagonist.4./5 

**Episode 8:**  Perfect Finale, answered all the questions from previous sections and didn't leave any narrative thread dangling. Some Unexpected winners and reveng saga continues. Don't know what happeed to rival charcater at the end. 5/5 

Overall one of the great series I have seen in a long time 4.8/5 | Today I enjoyed: BLUE EYE SAMURAI.

I would probably have missed this one, if it wasn't for my two favorite movie critics: Zwei wie Pech und Schwafel.

BLUE EYE SAMURAI is an animated series, but it is certainly **not** for children. The story follows Mizu, a young warrior on a bloody path of revenge to kill her father.

The show's title refers to the color of the protagonists eyes, which are blue due to the fact, that her father was a white man - one of four in Edo-period Japan at the time. Due to her eyes, she was a considered a so-called half-breed, not even a human being, but a monster or demon even, which her peers let her feel from a young age. She really connects until her mother is brutally murdered, and a smith takes her in and ultimately trains her in the ways of the sword.

What I found very peculiar about this show is, that for the first one and a half episode - or more, I think - I was uncertain if Mizu was female or male. I had a hunch that she was female right from the beginning, but her voice, her appearance, her overall demeanor indicated otherwise. It really took me some time to be certain of her gender and to me that means the show was doing a very good job in painting the character convincingly.

I cannot really go into all the details, but this show has it all: A great and compelling story, beautiful cinematography, both regarding landscapes and backdrops, but also regarding the characters and surroundings. Breathtaking action and fight scenes, remarkable and interesting characters, with which I never got bored with. Quite contrary: Even if the morale of the protagonist is questionable, I am rooting for her without hesitation.

To conclude: This is one of the examples where Netflix surprises with high quality entertainment, that is not just the typical bland and boring content, that today's streamers pour out like diarrhea ridden elephants.

BLUE EYE SAMURAI is a beautiful and brutal adult animation series that you have to see!

With eight episodes and a combined runtime of around 8 hours, the series obviously delves into the lives of all the people involved in the investigation, but is mainly told through the perspective of James R. Fitzgerald, who is an FBI criminal profiler.

Sam Worthington plays the role of Fitzgerald, and the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski is played by Paul Bettany. Both of these actors rose to fame through the Avatar and Marvel franchises respectively. Both of them are strong in their performance, especially Bettany, who steals the show with his engrossed performance.

The back and forth editing looks a bit shady, and the creators of the show simply abandon that approach around halfway of the show, which feels weird. The pace also slows down a bit in the middle part of the series. And there are a few ""investigation"" cliches that are seen. The main problem of the series is that it can't balance between the investigation stories and the courtroom stories, often ignoring one for the other. A more linear approach to the story would've been better.

However, the series is definitely one of the better investigation series on the internet, and is definitely worth the eight hours of watching it. If you are still not convinced, watch the first episode, and I think Paul Bettany will do the rest. | Eh....I really don't know how much of this movie is true. How many people are amalgamations. Some of the people depicted, especially the FBI agents, they seem too much to be true, too much a caricature, too good to be true. Too much in general, it sort of leads you to believe that the only character that was real was the Unabomber himself.

That being the case, it IS a series about catching the killer, and I've always believed that was the more interesting part of the serial killer movie fetish thing.

The killers have it easy. They have 323 Million people to hide out in.

The people that catch them, on the other hand, have it a lot harder, they literally have to find the needle in the haystack and, with a case like the Unabomber that haystack was the entire United States.

So, they did do a very good job of conveying that little detail, and that alone is worth watching. And, they did it without the NCIS overly techno-babble take on crime fighting that, for the most part, is too expensive to use if it even exists.

So, what you get to do is sit back and watch people solve a deadly serious puzzle. And the details of how they fit all the pieces together is displayed in an extremely believable way.

My only problem, the only thing that made me give it 6 stars is that, yeah, most of the characters didn't seem real. But, that is easy to get beyond because, this series is all in the how, not in the who.","Cameron Britton, Carla Gugino, Jack Huston, Arliss Howard, Ness Bautista",0.0,False,0.0,2017.0
