       "American idol, a season and series juggernaut, one of the most incredible and unique competitions to ever spark the world with the possibility of an unknown person becoming a mega star.\\r\\n\\r\\nRandy, Paula and Simon, iconic names on their own, but even more when you combine them together. Randy Jackson was a music mogul, an individual who played for Mariah Carey, and a legend in his own right. Paula Abdul music icon from the 80s, one of the biggest selling artist and amazing choreographers ever to step foot on a stage. And then Simon Cowell, the ruthless, aggressive and honest individual that America fell in love with. And has went on to become one of the Biggest Music executive directors in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m going to captivate all seasons in this one review, so this is going to be a long one, so enjoy. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeason one, what an incredible journey, a show that you did not think was going to last let alone become such a mega hit that it became. But more importantly, you had to have the right winner. With America voting did we get the right winner? America selected the quiet yet powerful vocals of Kelly Clarkson. Kelly Clarkson went on to solidify the show as a mega superpower. When she became a Grammy award-winning artist, television actress, movie actress, and she is now has a syndicated talk show. Kelly Clarkson went on to sell millions of albums, worldwide and even placed, second place in Idol against all the other idol competitions around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason two was the biggest controversial season we saw to date trying to follow up with the success of the first season, we awarded Ruben Studdard, the winner of American idol with a bunch of controversy, whether or not Clay Aiken should’ve been the one to go onto the show. Either way, both men came out of the successful and not only did the two men come out successful. Kimberly called well became in Household, hosting and becoming an actress.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason three delivered Fantasia Barrino, one of the most underrated incredible voices in the world. Her voice is so unique and iconic. She went onto also become a Grammy award winner and best selling R&B artist. She also stemmed Jennifer Hudson and Oscar winning and Grammy winning artist as well from that season who plays seventh place. This showed American idol was not just focused on the winner, but the people from the top 12 also had an opportunity to become super successful. From the season alone we also got Deanna Degarmo who went to become a Broadway legend.. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeason four, we got the greatest and legendary country singer in Carrie Underwood. She brought the fire and tore that season apart. She was a young lady who did not know anything and never had been on a plane. To go on and become a multi time, Grammy award winning artist and mega power, and now she sits at the table as one of the judges for American idol. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeason five became the new controversy, after season two and season three brought us severe controversy season five hit us even harder. Taylor Hicks took home the title of American Idol during this season, and ended up failing as a credible winner. Not being able to hold up to the four before him. All four artists before him either are Grammy winners or Grammy nominated artist. Taylor could not live up to those expectations and standards. His fourth finisher Chris Daughtry went to be a Grammy award-winning rockstar. Which is the person everyone thought was going to win this show. Catherine McVie became an actress and Elliott Yamin pulled out a great singing career as well. we also got the Grammy award winning Christian artist Mandisa, and we got country artist of Bucky Covington and country superstar Kellie Pickler. Season five may have had the wrong winner, but it had the most incredible group of top 12. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeason six, we got NFL football players, daughter Jordon Sparks as the winner youngest winner at that time. She went on to become also a Grammy nominated artist, keeping the trend alive that success can come from the show. We also got the boxing talents of Blake Lewis, and a few other individuals who stemmed from the show, but didn’t make it to the superstardom level.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason seven we started to the show out with one of the most incredible finale battles. We’ve seen in a long time David versus David , two different individuals. One rocker and one gospel singer. The older David, David Cook came out on top as he prevailed the rocker of the season. He went on to sell multiple albums, but still never reached the stardom of five of his predecessors. He still had a very successful career, but it was never a megastar career.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring our season, eight journey, American idol decided to spice things up by adding a fourth judge. Kara Diaguardi and she brought a lot of controversy between Simon and herself. After seven years of being the three they are now the four. Kris Allen captured the title of season eight, with one of the most controversial wins of all time. Front runner and expected winner. Adam Lambert went on to become a star in his own right, but was believed to be the actual winner of the show. But America was not ready for an LGBT winner. Especially someone who was completely open about their sexuality. Now American Idol served a little differently than it normally did you may have got a few people to have minor success after the show. But by this time, if you weren’t the winner, you barely got any success afterwards and that didn’t even mean if you got success. Unfortunately, he may have won the competition but he did just as bad as the previous winner from season five.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe move onto season nine still with the same set of judges, Lee Dewyze wins the title in the most forgettable, unsuccessful, and unpopular season ever. America was not fond of the singer, songwriter, crooner season, that transpired from dispatch. The only thing we got from this was gospel singer Colton Dixon, which to be honest with you, he might’ve actually came from a different season, they also attempted to spice things up just a little more, by replacing longtime judge Paula Abdul with Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen did not work out, she hated everything about judging people, and quit the show immediately after.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 10, we return to a three judges panel. With Ellen DeGeneres quitting and American idol not renewing Kara‘s contract, and then Simon Cowell exiting the show. We were left up in the air with the judges panel. They brought on Steven Tyler from Aerosmith and Latin legend, Jennifer Lopez. This season saw the winner of Scotty McCreery, who went on to become a country superstar, but not only that he also was the first in a long time where the runner-up went on to be a country superstar in Lauren Alaina. America and American idol were back on top.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved into season 11 with the same judges Randy, Jennifer,Steven and what a group they turned out to be, funny and hilarious and great judges. We saw the coronation of Philip Phillips, who went on to have one of the greatest singles of all time. And even had it as the Olympics theme song for that year. Philip had struggled afterwards to captivate and connect with the audience. Which put him in the same boat as Taylor, David, Kris and Lee. But the American Idol team was helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved on to season 12 this season saw the departure of Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez as judges. And brought in Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey. Unfortunately, for this season, Nikki and Mariah could not get along. The fighting, the continued arguments and bantering back-and-forth, took away from the contestants, and took away from their singing, and what the competition in the show was all about, and it turned into a dramatic all out mess. This season we got the winner of Candice Glover, who went on to do nothing, she became one of those forgotten winners, and one of the most failed American Idol winner of all time at this moment. She did release an album, but it failed on the charts. And it was because I believe the focus was off of these individuals and more on the dramatics of the judges. So nobody grew to love them like you did the previous winners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we went on to season 14 of American Idol. At this time, American Idol did not invite Nick or Mariah back, and Randy Jackson decided to part ways. The company brought back Jennifer Lopez to join Keith Urban and then brought on Harry Connick Junior, these three became the saving Grace of at least the judges panel. But it was too late for the show. The show kept these judges for the next three seasons. This season we saw the winner Caleb Johnson who took Candice‘s spot as the worst American Idol winner of all time. His failed rocker vibe and music did not captivate or grab anyone’s attention. His album flocked American idol continue to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 14, we got the winner of NickFradiani personally he is one of my favorite winners, because his music is incredible and underrated. But to the general public, he didn’t sell as bad as the other two but he’s definitely in the bottom five. He did continue to go on to perform in local venues and push forward the best he could. But now it was a stain on the American idol winners, and I believe it stems from that toxic judges panel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved onto season 15, the end of American idol. They brought back the winners and some fan favorites, had a huge celebration for all the years the show was on there. The judges all came back and everybody celebrated. As the winner, Trent Harmon took on the final title of American idol. And even though, it is the end, it did not give him the push. He thought he was going to get. And he once again with the American idol winners became a failed champion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican idol stayed gone for over a year, and the general public did miss the show, so Walt Disney purchases the show and brings it back with a more positive and energetic flare. They brought it back with the worst voting system, date. The judges had more power than America, so they got to choose majority of who they’re putting in, when America is the one that should be choosing because we are the ones that buy the albums. I said since day one, this was going to be a failure, if they do not change it back to single elimination instead of group elimination. But American idol decided it was going to do its own thing and push on.\\r\\n\\r\\nKaty Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan became the new judges of American Idol season 16 through 22\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m gonna combine the seasons together for the most part, but I’m going to still give them their due and their credibility. Season 16 we saw the winner of Maddie Poppee who also was the wrong winner, because Gabby Barrett who worked third place in the show went on to be a country superstar and was the front runner the entire time. We finally got some thing from one of those shows, but it wasn’t the winner. Unfortunately, the winner went on to be a failed winner again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 17 we saw Laine Hardy someone from previous season come back and capture the title. The Elvis look-alike young country megastar was going to be born, but American idol sat on his album debut, and sat on his music. To the point lane, then became a failed winner and gotten legal trouble, he’s making a return today as we speak. But it may be too late for the young country artist. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 18 the pandemic season, the season that took place with everybody filming from their living room or their bedrooms. We watched as American idol still tried to keep this show relevant with everybody submitting their videos, the judges were on zoom, the contestants were on zoom and we continued to watch this show as just Sam, a young woman with financial issues captured the title. She had a beautiful voice and an incredible presence for someone who was never on the stage. Yet, American Idol dropped the ball with her completely, and she became the worst winner of all time. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe moved onto season 19 when Chayce Beckham, captured the title, he went on to also be a failed winner and not successful in the world of music. He did have one song that slowly climb the charts, but never quite got anywhere. He was brought back many times on the show, but that was the only time you seen or heard of him. Yet, just Sam was still left off the show. And never took the stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 20 we got the winner of Noah Thompson, the wrong winner of American idol hands-down no questions asked. He captured the title of the show because he was extremely attractive. There was no way that America actually voted him in as the best singer, except they chose him based on his looks. And where did it get us another failed winner American idol is tarnished, I don’t see the show producing a mega star ever again. We have went through so much and yet we’ve gotten nowhere. \\r\\n \\r\\nBut American idol continue to push forward with season 21, that’s when America finally saw firsthand. We claimed wrong winners in the past, but this was hands-down the wrong winner. Iam Tongi American idol’s first Hawaiian winner, went on to accomplish nothing. No music, no album and definitely no concerts. He was awarded the win on this show simply because of the passing of his parent, there is no way that this man beat half of the people that he was going up against. Unfortunately, the winners are final and they claim America’s vote. But this is the first time I questioned 100% whether or not, the show was rigged. They think they were going to get success from this person, no, they are not thinking, marketing wise, American idol went for a sympathetic run instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 22 another controversy strikes American Idol as Katy Perry the judge is called out for bullying a woman for having a baby and sex under age. Even though that is not what happened, we’re in a world of cancel culture. We’re in a world where people blow up social media and change things. So this will be the last season for Katie Perry as a judge. we went on to Crown the winner of Abi Carter, American idol, normally by this time has pushed their artist to be close to having an album, to get music out there and to captivate the world. But we have yet to see anything or hear anything from this young lady and it just looks like we’re gonna follow the same train of another failed winner.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 23 Carrie Underwood American idol. All they need is one mega star to come forward to reconnect the crowd and the audience and build up the history of these legendary winners from the past. Because we have not seen a single successful winner since season 10 and before season six. American Idol has more failed winners than they do champions.    2\n",
       "Just totally worth it. | Visually excellent, the dark broody streets of run down neighbourhoods contrasted with the pastel, immaculate high contrast world of the game, Superbly cast and acted, the characters are well written, their desperation made palpable and importantly, all too believable. Kept me invested throughout with episode 6 being one of my favourite and  most emotionally resonant episodes of television I'd seen in a while. Goes a bit off the boil towards the end which was my least favourite part  and almost undoes some of the earlier good work but overall entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable. | A perfect opening and great second episode , is let down by below average follow up episodes , which are unable to achieve the tensions or intrigue presented in earlier episodes. It may be masterpiece for those who have find death game genre through squid game, but the series death game personally didn't do much for me because I have expirenced the games and tension and political commentary from superior servings such as Kaiji and thousands of other death battle manga, Liar Game being the best .\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst two episode 10 and 9\\r\\nmiddle episode rating average 6\\r\\nFinal episode 5(unnecessarily extending the stale concept)\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall 6.1/10 | extremely disappointing idea theft\\r\\nSo once there was \"The most dangerous game\" (you see \"game\" in the title?) where shipwreckes survivors are hunted by Count Zaroff and if they survive they're free. Then on the \"survive or win\" we have Cube, Saw, Death race, Hunger games, Battle royale (already the most ripped off in Squid Game, As the gods will (also extremely ripped off in Squid Game).\\r\\nSo here the theme is the bleak today's world where a father can't keep a job and gain money for his family. So an invite comes for a game where you can gain big money. But soon contestants die. My interest died at this point. But to have an opinion, I watched it til the end. There was a big reveal, wow that was the best they could do? \\r\\nSo to be precise in the ripoffs. Battle Royale, teenagers are sent to an island and the sole survivor is freed. This is a GAME, there's rules, a duration, an objective. Same for SG, rules, objective, duration. As the gods will we have teenagers visited by a strange head sculpture that takes them hostage and makes them participate in various KIDS games where most will die. Does it describe Squid Game? Especially the \"kids\" games turned to horror adult death traps.\\r\\nThe directing and acting are average at best. I got fed upo with the father fast with his stunned face he does all the time.\\r\\nSome design of the games is OK, but also close to As the gods will.\\r\\nI put 1/10 for obvious steal of an already oversused idea (yeah Hunger Games was of the most horrible movies I've sen in my life). | Whilst not an entirely original idea, \"Squid Game\" is done with enough inspiration, to warrant at least, a look. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, it took me quite some time to tune in. The idea didn't immediately appeal to me, as it did a lot of other viewers. I found the first season, creative, colourful and more than little disturbing. Of course, children's games combined with murder, was never going to be comfortable mix. \\r\\n\\r\\nI do believe season one is markedly better than the second go around. Season two offers more of the same, with less of the intrigue inherent in the first season. The introduction of blatant DEI content in season two, is something I could have well and truly done without, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, I believe \"Squid Game\" is a one season hit. Having watched all of season one and most of season two, I see little to distinguish two from its predecessor.Give season one a go by all means but my personal belief is season two, adds little of value. I rate season one 7/10 and two 6/10.  | Masterpiece in every way! It's super interesting. Not a single dull moment in this show. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in season 2, seems like liberal fascists infiltrated in this show and meddled with this it. So, we got transgender character who identifies himself as a \"woman\"and goes to women restroom with the rest ladies. Others also refer to him as \"her\". I'm so tired from this crap. Man is man and woman is woman, period. No matter how many times you liberal fascists try to put your idiotism and dirty agenda into movies and shows, this fact will remain fact and you only enrage people more with your forced propaganda. This is why you lost in US elections and this is why you're going to lose more and more. Get used to it. You're a dying breed, leftists.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll still give this show 10/10, because show itself is a real masterpiece. Probabaly creators were forced to put this crap agenda in season 2, because season 1 was clean from it. Hopefully after January 20th, when Trump enters the office, we will see less and less propaganda in shows and movies. World is slowly waking up.



       "Why does every series with a premise based on alternate reality, look a whole lot like every other series with the same premise?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is tales of alternate reality have been done to death, so much so, that the whole premise now looks a lot like a cliche. Dark Matter has an instant issue, with this reviewer, for this very reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been series that have pulled it off beautifully, like German series Dark. It worked because there was enough complexity and depth in the alternate reality story, not to mention it played wonderfully with paradoxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, Dark Matter feels simplistic and predictable. It was obvious within a few frames who the masked attacker is and what comes after doesn't really improve greatly on this observation. Indeed, its largely unsubtle in its handling, which does little to draw you in or have you asking questions as Dark did.\\r\\n\\r\\nActing is reasonable, its a solid cast and whilst production values are high, this one just doesn't resonate with me after two, rather pedestrian, episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, the simplistic and predictable, lets call it \"safe\" handling doesn't put this series in the same class, as imaginative risk takers, like Dark. If you have't seen this kind of series before you may still enjoy Dark Matter, I have no doubt. That said, for the more seasoned and jaded science fiction viewers amongst us, its not an alternative reality, its just more of the same. | Dark Matter (2024) is a dismal misfire that fails on nearly every front. From the outset, it becomes painfully clear that “nothing matters” in this convoluted mess of amateur sci-fi soap opera and tedious family drama. The series boasts poor editing, with jarring cuts and pacing issues that make its already thin narrative feel even more disjointed. The characters are lifeless, reduced to cardboard archetypes who make inexplicably stupid decisions at every turn.\\r\\nThe supposed high-concept premise quickly devolves into unintentional comedy, weighed down by endless, repetitive family details that sap any potential for intrigue or suspense. Rather than offering compelling stakes, the show drags viewers through a nonsensical plot that fails to make its point—if it even had one. Any attempts at drama come off as ridiculous, leaving viewers more frustrated than entertained.\\r\\nWith no sense of direction or payoff, Dark Matter collapses into a black hole of mediocrity. It’s a waste of time, energy, and life—an experience devoid of entertainment or enlightenment. What could have been an engaging exploration of cosmic and existential themes instead becomes a tragic reminder of how not to make television. Avoid this series at all costs.

       "I know everyone is tired of the old trope of complaints about woke shows in Hollywood.  \\r\\nThis is worse.  \\r\\nThe prequel, *The Fosters* was highly politicised and a little preachy but addressed legitimate issues most of the time.  \\r\\nThis does not even bother to get facts right or pretend to be anything other than a cult-like show.

       "We almost never see a historical drama led by the commoners. This drama came out in 1996 but it has such a fresh and interesting take on the entire genre to this very day! However, it's not perfect, its biggest problem is that it's bloated with too many side stories carried by less interesting characters which delayed getting to good parts. The drama didn't fully focus on Im Kkeok Jung until the 2nd half. The set design was decent for 1996. The set was reasonably lit at night while taking into consideration they used to use candles instead of high beam studio lights back then!

       "Best show in the 80s!\\r\\nMagnum is the guy who everybody wants to be, and what every lady wants.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagnum, P.I. is a feel good TV series everybody to enjoy. | Had it come out in the 90s, Tom Magnum would have been a paranoid character fighting off the nightmares that plague him for all eternity after losing half his men in combat, or being the last man left in his squad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd had it come out today, he'd be almost perfect, struggling never, with no character development. Stagnate, boring, with no growth to speak of. He'd be right all the time and end each episode political statement... like the New Magnum does.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead he was written in the 80s, and he is kind of a mooch, but a charismatic one. He struggles and overcomes, his relationship with his friends grows and evolves, and he deals with Vietnam and flashbacks in a realistic and functioning way.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is capable of screwing up and fixing his mistakes. He is light and comical and void of an agenda. And he has friends that will unquestioningly follow him into a bar room brawl just because, well, that's what real friends do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt makes everything fun and relatable, it makes the show more down to earth and realistic that it would have been in following decades. And that goes double when its a story that involves an expensive sports car... which, to make it believable, he doesn't own.

       "3/3.5 stars\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently started watching this show and for the first several episodes I was very intrigued. Kilgrave the super-villain (acted insanely well by Tennant), is compelling, and Jones at first is sympathetic, interesting, and supporting characters have promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately by Episode 7 I had lost quite a bit of interest. After a while Jones - perpetually drunk, unwashed, sullen and angry - grates; she is very one-dimensional. Although what happened to her was terrible, other people have suffered at Kilgrave's hands, but no one takes it to the persistent pity-party levels Jones does, or does as good a job at alienating people. She's not coping, and snarls at anyone who tries to help her. She doesn't want people to get hurt because of her, but she is so emotionally crippled and wound so tightly by what happened it is difficult to trust her judgment and perspective, or sometimes even if she is sane. She can't see that every moment she lives her life in a broken way is a victory for Kilgrave. \\r\\n\\r\\nEpisode 7 is a good example. After Kilgrave leaves her a terrible 'present', she hatches a wacky, unbelievable plot that she eventually convinces her friends to sort of go along with, against their better judgment. (Just the idea that a 'detective' would THINK you could get locked up immediately in SuperMax is absurd.) It's not even clear that she has really thought this through but her wild ranting and demand that everyone listen to her finally 'wins' people over. You get the feeling after a while any price is okay as long as she beats Kilgrave. Kilgrave is a bloody monster, but I'm not certain Jones wouldn't be okay with the entire world going to Hell if she could finally catch him. \\r\\n\\r\\nShe's just too one dimensional. Her potential thoughtfulness and complexity is lost in a haze of booze, self-recrimination and self-pity. After a while she doesn't really engender sympathy but encourages eye rolls. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also haven't felt the connexion with Luke. Carnally maybe, but there is nothing that gives you a feel for them together, except for one scene at a food truck and protracted interactions in the bedroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nRuben is a wasted character; I thought there would be more to him and his infatuation, but no. Malcolm and Simpson clearly have parts to play and I am still a bit curious what will happen but that is now really tempered. I was excited to see the next episode but I need time to recover after the mess that was 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother drawback... I read Netflix is postponing season two until next year. That's just too long a break! | Netflix's next Marvel series, which is quite, and focuses on trauma from abuse; physical, sexual and/or psychological.\\r\\n\\r\\nKristen Ritter was pretty good as the titular character, as was David Tennant as Kilgrave, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was disappointment that it ended, I am at the same time pleased that it did in good form. | Of the 5 Marvel shows Netflix did this one is by far the weakest, Jessica Jones tries to be a Privet detective show and goes extremely heavily on all the clichés. Kilgrave is an interesting villain, but can't make up for the weak character that Jessica Jones is. I would recommend any of the Netflix marvel shows over this one, even Iron Fist season 1 was more entertaining than this.
